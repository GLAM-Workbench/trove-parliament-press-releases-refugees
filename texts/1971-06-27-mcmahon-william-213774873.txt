THE P R D ^ J^ W J^ R ^ J^ R ._ W JL L ^ ^ ^ m H _ O N   AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA “

27_MAY_1971_

PRIME MINISTER : Before I ask you to ask questions, I would like to make three  announcements to you, and they all relate to Government policy. The first one  is that Mr. Peter Howson will be appointed the Minister in charge of the new  portfolio. Yesterday afternoon, I had an audience with His Excellency the  Governor-General and he agreed to commission Mr. Howson on Monday, probably  at three o'clock.

I have already stated the functions of the portfolio in the House, but if  you want to get complete details so that you can use them tomorrow morning, they  will be available from Mr. MacDonald, my Press Secretary. The name of the  Department will be the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, and I hope that

Mr. Howson will be able to take up the appointment quickly and come to grips  with many of the problems that are so urgently in need of being answered and  solved.

The second one relates to our Repatriation system. For some time  now, many organisations, many reputable ones, and particularly the Returned  Servicemen's League, have asked for an independent enquiry into the repatriation  system - its objectives and its rationale - and we have agreed to the independent  enquiry. Later on today, I will be issuing a press statement about it and all  the details relating to principle will be contained in that press statement.

Subsequently, of course, we will have to appoint the independent authority and  then draft the term s of reference. These will be announced as soon as we can  by the Minister for Repatriation himself.

And the third one relates to our contribution to the East Pakistan  refugees - that is those who are going into India. The Government has agreed this  morning that we will contribute $500,000 to the East Pakistan refugee organisation  in Calcutta, of which $200,000 will be made available immediately, and after  discussion v/ith the Calcutta authorities, the other $300,000 will be made available  as and when it is needed. The initial $200,000 will be a cash grant to the Red  Cross, a certain amount of money for medical supplies that are desperately

needed, and the third amount will be for temporary accommodation such as tents  which have been asked for by the refugee authorities themselves. This is, as you  know, a tremendously serious affair with over three million refugees moving from  the North-East of Pakistan into India. We have expressed our great sorrow at  what has happened and we hope by this means that we will be able to make some  contribution to the assistance of the refugees themselves.

Now having said all that, may I ask those who want to ask questions  either to please stand up or put up their hands and I will call them in turn.

?. In announcing the appointment of Mr. Howson, you made no reference  to the appointment of the Assistant Ministers whom the Parliament also approved  the appointment of. When will you be appointing these?

)

ÃÂ ÃÂ can't finalise the decision relating to the Assistant Ministers until

Mr. Anthony returns. I had discussions with him a few days before he left bijt  he wasn't in a position to announce those Assistant Ministers whom he wanted to  appoint, and so I will have to leave it for the time being. But I have decided that  Ministers to assist other Ministers will be appointed in two cases. The first one

is that the Minister in Charge of the House, that is Mr. Swartz, Minister for  National Development will have a Minister assisting him. And Mr. Snedden will  have a Minister assisting him as well. In the first case it will be Mr. Chippy who  will also be the Deputy Leader in the House, and in the case of Mr. Snedden, it will  be Mr. Andrew Peacock. These are the only appointments I can announce at the  moment. In Mr. Snedden's case, ÃÂª think you will agree that it has to be donp so that  the Minister assisting him will be able to go right through the Budget papers and  help him not only in the preparation but in the presentation of the papers to the  Cabinet.

>. So we will have another six Assistant Ministers on top of these two

assisting M inisters.. . .

M. Well one is Assistant Minister and that is an official title. The other

is a Minister of State who will be assisting another Minister.

). Well Assistant Ministers, how many of those are we going to gep

M. Well I don't know yet. I haven't made up my mind, but I will be;

discussing this when Mr.' Anthony returns.

). Does Mr. Peacock's appointment in this role, Sir, mean that you will

not have a Minister of State assisting you?

M. At the moment. I want to give him greater experience. He is an able

bloke and 1 think it is wise to put him into different portfolios to get the experience,  and in particular I think he will do well in the Treasury with Mr. Snedden.

In the context of the appointment of the Minister will it mean an  increase in the Public Service?

M Â· No.

i. I can recall Mr. Gorton said there would be no further recruitment.

ÃÂ I haven't yet approved of any increases in the Public Service because  of the action taken.

|. Sir, reverting to your first announcement does the change in title and

your description of its functions mean that the Executive Council Secretariat will  not now be moved from Prime M inister’s Department as originally planned?

ÃÂ I think you can take it that the probability is that the Secretariat of

the Executive Council will remain with the Prime M inister's Department. But it  is not of great importance or significance, and in deference to the wishes of the  Governor-General the probabilities are I will leave it with the Prime M inister's .  I haven't made up my mind about it.

3.

Q.

Council?  That means that Mr. Howson will be Vice-President of the Executive

PM

Q:

PM

No.

Sir, will he tid No. 27 in the order of priority?

Yes.

Qi . Can I open up another topic, Prime Minister? On May 11 you

announced the Federal Government had decided to try to initiate dialogue with  the People's Republic of China. What steps have you taken since then to initiate  this dialogue? '

PM We have taken steps to bpen up the dialogue, but this is one occasion  where quiet diplomacy is essential. ; If we we re  to divulge the source that we  have approached in order to open up the dialogue, we think it could do harm.  And as I have said, and I want to repeat this - we want to do this carefully. We

want to measure every step we have taken, and to consider the gains for this  country. And every step taken will be in term s of a profit and Idss account and  we want to see that that turns out for the benefit of Australia. So I have got to  handle this with the maximum of subtlety and caution, and I am unable at thb

moment, anyhow, to mention the area where we have opened up the initiative.  I

Q. Again on China, Sir, doesn't the sale by BHP of $6-| million worth-

of pig iron represent a cut across the Strategic List? !

PM No it does not. And I have made that plain already. It does not cut

across the Strategic List in any way. Every part of the supply by the BHP fo  Mainland China can be provided from other sources. And if we don’t do it,! some  one else will. Â·

Q. Sir, can you say whether you have had anything that you can consider  a response at all to your announcements for the Government's desire for :  dialogue?

PM Yes, we have had a response. We have had at least two responses.

Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you have stated quite secret sources a n d -

careful and quiet diplomacy...

PM I didn't say "secret sources" - I didn't use those words. "Qujiet

diplomacy" I said. y 3

Q......- . . . .  .Any chance that this same quiet diplomacy can be used in trying

to get access to new information about the Australian journalist Francis James? I 'V ;

PM In time, perhaps, but we had already approached other source^ vho had immediate contacts with the Peking Government and asked if they would make  further enquiries for us about Francis James. They informed us, after some  delay, that they thought it was better that we went elsewhere to try and get the

information.

4 .

J. Sir, are you considering Government, as distinct from private trade

missions to China, to deal with commodities other than wheat? ,

>M  Not at the moment. I can’t answer that question in fact, but we are,

as I said in the statement I made in the H ouse, giving visas to private :  interests to go and over one hundred Australians went to the Canton Trade Fair,  and we can at least account for $12 to $15 million worth of contracts from this  source.

J. Sir, you have said you have had at least two responses from China.

Have they been positive ones? Do you feel that the Chinese are interested in  dialogue with us ?

'ÃÂ I can't tell you that. They have been probing enquiries.

Sir, are the responses from China or from a third party that we are  dealing with?

Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ  I won't go any further than I have g o n e  at the moment, because as I

said, if ever there is a case where we need quiet diplomacy, if we want to be  successful, this is the occasion.

Can you take it this far, Sir? Can you say whether they are at a  significantly high level?

'M No, I will go no further, Mr. Reid.

1. Mr. Snedden was reported earlier this week as saying it would be a

tough Budget. You are reported in this month's issue of the "Australian Liberal"  as having said the same thing either to the State Council or the N. S. W. State  Liberal Party. Have you discussed this with Mr. Snedden?

'M F irst, I never used the words "a tough Budget" anywhere. I certainly

didn't use it at a private meeting of Liberal Party members. Secondly, Mr. Snedden  is in control of the Budget, and it is up to him to use the descriptions that he thinks  are best. After all, I believe in Ministerial responsibility, subject, of course, to  overall control by the Prime Minister and by the Cabinet. But it is his Ministerial  responsibility to conduct the public relations associated with the Budget and I want  to make no comment about it whatsoever.

). Mr. Prime Minister, following this, do you think it is wise to have your

T reasurer making comments on the nature of the Budget so far ahead? in this case,  one has to think of the concern this has caused the business community.

ÃÂ I think Mr. Snedden was wise in making the statement he did at the

time he made it. Equally, too, did he make a statement today - or tonight - I am  not quite sure when he is making it - to the manufacturers. I approved of it, and  those who have good memories should compare it with the statement I made in  the House of March of this year. You would think we were both making the same

speech.

K Does this mean then, that the nature of the Budget is going to be divulged

in advance...

5 .

PM No it does not. I don't think Mr. Snedden will be making any more

speeches about this. What you have got to remember is that up until the present  moment, we have no papers whatsoever in froit of the Cabinet or the Cabinet  Secretariat.

Q. You have said that the rate of inflation in Australia is now running at

over 5% per year and this is an increase that is almost double of what it was about  two years ago. Is this Government now prepared to live with this rate of inflation  or does it want to cut back on inflation.

PM Of course we want to cut back on inflation. In a country like ours that

is a very big exporter, and has to compete in the international markets against  the international giants, and particularly, too, in the case of a country that has  so many prim ary producers dependent upon their income for the export of their  own products, the lower we can get inflation, the better it is for them. Now our  position is different to any other country, and it is no use saying that relatively  our position is better than others. That is not the answer in our circumstances  and we have got to do everything we can to get down the rate of inflation to

something that is lower than increases in productivity.

Q. In January or February this year, the Government, as it was,

announced decisions which were aimed at reducing inflation. Is the Governmeit  now satisfied that these had some effect or does it still believe that further  measures will be necessary?

PM I think your words are the best description that I can give of it

- "satisfied that they are having their effect".. .  I can't better those words.  That is the best I can say about it. But of course we could do better and if we could  get inflationary pressures down, and we could have the consumer index reduced,  we would want it. This is the biggest problem we face at the moment in the

economic field, and we must do everything we can in order to see that the  pressures are reduced. But I do not believe that any measures, any other measures  will be needed until the Budget. And if I can say this in one area - that is  monetary policy and interest rate policy - I believe v/e have been pretty successful  because now we find we will have a Budget surplus, an internal Budget surplus of

$450 million - v/e thought a few months ago it would be ever so much lower. We  think that the interest rate structure now, subject to movement of anomalies from  time to time, is just about right. And thefact that we had $193 million contribution  to the recent Loan and a large number of subscriptions to the Loan that has just

ended is, I think, a remarkably successful result from the Government's point  of view. I could say more about this problem of monetary control because I think  it is acting well, but I think other questions have got to be asked before we get  into that.

Q. Sir, well on that very point, on the Loan result, when he announced it,

Mr. Snedden did say there was some evidence, not precise evidence, he said, that  the result was not a matter of foreign money chasing high interest rates - it was  the first indication, in fact, of the new measurement of capital inflow. Can you  actually say where the foreign money is coming from?

. . . . /6

6 .

PM , I think we can, but Mr. Snedden's description v/as the best one. From a Treasury point of view, and from a detailed economic analysis point of view, the  word "precise" is the accurate word to use. But I remember the time when I was  in the Treasury, I instructed the Reserve Bank to devise better means of  determining both the origins and the components of capital inflows. And we

strengthened what was called the ticket system, that is the system used by the  private trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank under which they ticked off  various entries in tickets, and when money was received in Australia and sent  them to the Reserve Bank. And that was an indication - but only an indication -

of both source and component. At the same time, we asked additional questions  when approval was required for the moment of funds into Australia. And 1 think  you can take it that of the components, and no more than the components, that  a large amount of the money was in term s of private investment. A large amount

was because of the maturity of the Australian money market system and Australian  corporations have been able to borrow large sums particularly in the United  States. This is called institutional loans. It is obvious, too, that there isn't a  great deal in portfolio investment because if there was the Stock Exchange would  be rising and not falling. Other amounts, too, are what are called lags. We do  find that, wisely, Australian importers are now delaying payment for the goods  that they have purchased and this is another reason why the capital inflow is

somewhat bigger than you would have otherwise expected, in other words, while  we can't get the figures accurately enough for statistical purposes, at least we  have got a pretty good idea that there isn't very much hot money involved.

5. Bearing in mind your recent statement that the Government wanted the South African rugby and cricket tours to go ahead as planned, and that  Mr. Whitlam has been rather silent on this in the last few weeks, and some trade  unions in recent days have said they would not ban the tours, do you expect there  will now be little difficulty with the South Africans touring this country and staying  at the hotels, and if there are some bans by the unions that affect the tours, has  the Government promised to make Government air transport available to get the  tours around the country?

?M I have made one statement and that is that we want the tour to go on

and we will do nothing which is likely to obstruct it. if it so happens that an  attempt is made by Mr. Hawke to obstruct it, then, of course, we will look at  the position and decide whether the Government is to take action. But that is  hypothetical. But can I now that you have opened up this subject, state the  Government's policy clearly to you. F irst of all, we don't believe in the  interference in the affairs of other countries as we resent other countries

interfering in our affairs. Secondly, we b ilieve that politics ought to be divorced  from your sporting and recreational, artistic and other cultural types of activity.  I don't believe, and no-one in my Government believes, that an ACTU or any  political party should interfere in what are purely domestic matters. For this  reason, we feel the tour should go on, and I believe this is the wish of the great

majority of the Australian people. A Gallup Poll was decisive in saying that the  people wanted it. The Queenslander view was more than decisive, and  consequently, I believe the tour should continue. And I will continue, too, in  this way. We don't like apartheid, and I made this clear and the Australian  people’s feelings clear to the South African Government. But we don't think that  clumsy methods, methods that depend upon intimidation are every likely to be

successful. On the contrary, they are likely to be counter-productive. And I

. . . .  p

7 .

think the-attitude taken by so many African States now - Malawi, Sierra Leone,  Lesotho - is the right course to follow - they are but a few of the countries I can  mention. They believe the, proper way to handle this problem is by dialogue and  by co-operation. Those are phrases I heard used by the President of Malawi

myself, and I think if we want to get a solution to this problem, we had better leave  it in their hands rather than the clumsy methods that I mentioned just a few moments  ago.

. Do you think Mr. Hawke should have corresponded direct with  Mr. Vorster?

SA That is Mr. Hawke’s business. I don't want to make any comment

about him. But if the previous implication can be implied as aimed at Mr. Hawke,  then you are entitled to make the implication.

. Qantas was held to  ransom for half a million dollars yesterday. It is

a Federal Government airline - the Federal Government is in charge of Civil  Aviation. The New South Wales Government has today offered a reward and your  Government hasn't. Do you have any plans along these lines?

Vi Yes. We have decided to offer in addition to the New South Wales  Government a reward of $30,000.

. On that subject, are you involved otherwise than in the offering of

a reward. As you ultimately, through the Treasury, will be the donor of the  $500,000 that was paid, have you any views on the course of action that Qantas  adopted in this?

Vi No, I haven't. When I was telephoned by my Press Officer at the

Governor-General's residence yesterday, at round about 5. 40, my first thought  was for the safety of the passengers and the crew. And I consequently felt I  should get the senior civil servants into my office immediately and as many  Ministers as I could who were in Canberra, and I contemplated getting Billy

Snedden back from .. .  the T reasurer back from Melbourne, so that we could  discuss it. But then I find in my first telephone conversation with Sir Donald  Anderson of Civil Aviation that the decision had been made.

, Have you got any views on th e .. . .

ÃÂ No, I have got no views. I will leave that for Cotton to handle

with the T reasurer and they will have to put up any thoughts they wish to me.

, Prime Minister, to get back to the China dialogue for a minute. In

view of the Government's initiatives, do you think they could receive any setback  by the Labor Party mission which is to visit there next month?

ÃÂ I don't think so. The Chi nese are calm and collected people in making

these decisions. Increasingly the power in the hierarchy seems to be shifting to  the professional officials and away from those engaged in the Cultural Revolution.  And if the power structure is altering, we feel that the Foreign Office, and  particularly the Premiership, will be handled in a much more subtle way than was

done previously. I don't think they can do very much harm. They may perhaps  be able to do some good.

, , Back on the domestic political scene. There is a group called the

Businessmen for Democratic Government who apparently doesn't like your reign.  What can you tell us about this group? Do you regard them as a serious threat to  you? Ã¢ÂÂ

M No I don't. As you know this is pretty old hat stuff because they tried

it when Mr. Gorton became the Prime Minister and wanted to run my colleague  Alan Fairhall against him. It petered out fairly quickly.

t You don't say who it w as...

M Mr. Pat Sayers. But if you have read the National Times on Sunday,

they had an interview with him and he then stated that his fundamental objective  was to destroy the Liberal and Country Parties and it wasn't an attack on me  personally. Nov/ he has disclosed that he is a front for the Labor Party, a front  probably for left wing socialists. And he refuses to deny that of the so-called

Liberals who he says are supporting him, or to confirm whether they are  American concerns, and it is these American concerns that will be providing some  of the funds.

. Apropos the T reasurer speaking to the manufacturers, there has been

some suggestion the 20 per cent investment allowance might be restored - the  20 per cent investment allowance that was suspended last February. There was  one report, I think ir, the "Financial Review" about that. Have you been thinking  along those lines for the Budget?

M What do you mean? That it might be reinstated?

. Yes.

Vi No, it won't.

. Sir, we have all read "Time ". Any comment?

Vi The "Time" article?

. Yes.

Vi No, I don't want to comment about it. Personally I wasn't very much

affected by the article. There were some quite complimentary things and others  that were untrue. But my Press-Officer, who is very much like you - he belongs  to your group, and to your clan - he felt that there was a matter here of  professional ethics involved v/hen there were two statements that were not correct.

On his own initiative, he wrote a letter to "Time" stating what the two mistakes  were. He was right, and frankly, getting to know him better and better every  day, I think the attitude he adopted was the correct one. In other words, he said  he had put some questions to me. He had not done so. Secondly he said that  he asked me a question on Australia in the 1970s. He didn't do so at the formal  discussions, but as he got to the door,, and I was moving out to get a plane, he  then asked me the question. I said, "Look, wouldn't it-be better if I got a few  notes for you and you had a word to one of my officials - my Private Secretary, Kim Jones". He said, "Well, perhaps I may". But the "perhaps" was the right  words. He didn't* '

Prime Minister, what are your thoughts on the future of Australia?

ÃÂ On which?

, On the future of Australia.

ÃÂ I live here. I am proud of it. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else and

if I was anywhere else, I would want to come here.

, Mr. Prime Minister, in the uproar of the last week of the Session of

the House of Representatives, it was the view that this was partly caused by the  bank-ÃÂÃÂ of legislation towards the end of the Session and that you had instituted a  Departmental enquiry into how this could be avoided. How is that enquiry going?

ÃÂ We have moved a long way. The first action that has been taken is to

reform our Legislation Committee. Previously the Legislation Committee only  acted to ensure bills brought before the H ouse conformed to the decisions made  by Cabinet. We have now widened its jurisdiction to provide for continuous  programming of bills during the whole of the session of the House. And we want to

ensure that instead of coming in in a rush in the last days of the House, they are  systematically and progressively introduced as the House proceeds. Now you know  just as well as I do that this has been a problem every since Federation and  that we can't completely overcome the problem, but I think by this method we will  be able to go a long way to get bills introduced in the early and middle parts of  the Session and we will be able to reduce the tensions and the rush right at the end.  The Departmental officials are also looking at the problem of this committee and  what other methods can be taken, and I think you k now that a Party Committee  under Malcolm F raser has been appointed to 1 ook at the whole procedures of the  House. We are proceeding steadily. I hope that by the time the House meets we  will be able to say what we think ought to be done. But I have already mentioned  to you the major steps.

, Sir, there was a fairly simple way of overcoming the problem created

by the rush of legislation on this creation and that was to have extended the Sittings  of the House by an extra week or two as in fact the Senate finished up doing. Could  you tell us why this wasn't done?

ÃÂ Look, that would take me all day. But I will give you three explanations

if you like. The first one was no doubt due to the fact that we had a change in the  leadership of the Liberal Party and of the Government, and consequently in the  personnel of the Attorney-General and of the Leader of the House. The second  one was that if you look at the bills, you will see that six of them were surrounding  one substantive bill and five of them were a matter of consequential amendments  to other bills. Now the main bill itself, Commonwealth Employees' Compensation  Bill, I put the original elements of the bill on the table of the House when I was  the T reasurer. That is how long ago they have had it, and the Labor Party wanted

it and didn't want any amendments to it, so you count out that six. That left  eleven. We then had three more - one on the science blocks which we could very  easily have left, and that reduces it to ten, and the other two were two normal  orthodox Treasury Bills that are necessary - always brought in at this time - and  didn't introduce any novel features whatsoever. So we had eight. We had one other  real difficulty. And I don't think we would have struck any real problems but for  this difficulty.

. . . / I Q

10 .

Normally in a guillotine, it runs on from a particular hour to another particular  hour - from 3 o'clock on one day to five o'clock the next day - am or pm whichever  you like. On this occasion, we introduced it in the form of so many minutes or

hours for each particular bill and that gave the Opposition a glorious opportunity  in order to exploit the Standing O rders of the House in order to frustrate the  passage of the Government's legislation. But that is past history. That won't  happen again, particularly that type of guillotine. I can assure you of that. What

is important, and it is critically important, is that I do everything in my power to  see that in f  uture, (a) there is adequate time and (b), that we schedule the bills  so that we give the important ones plenty of time for discussion and we put them  through the House in accordance with the programme that can be approved of by  the Legislation Committee.

. A related question . You elaborated your new China policy first in a

press statement after the invitation arrived for the Labor delegation, and then at a  dinner which was originally going to be a private dinner. Why didn't you explain  the Government's China policy to the House of Representatives which rose only a  few days earlier? And don't you think that is what Sir Robert Menzies and possibly  the late Mr. Holt would have done?

Vi I don't think he would have done it. I don't think Mr Holt would have done  it and I have heard no comment whatsoever from the Labor Party about it or asked  that it should have been done there. So that is the point. The second point is it was  an enormously important meeting of businessmen and commercial people in New

Smith Wales and I thought it was a suitable opportunity to do it. I wanted it to  receive wide publicity and it did. But above all, I feel that this was a matter of  such.. . .  I wanted to get the widest publicity for it and it did. And I believe that the  overseas reaction to that speech has been as great as any overseas reaction I have  known, certainly known, during the course of the last five years. And it did a lot  of good. .

. The Senate Committee on Securities and Exchange has been very much in  the news, particularly with this decision calling for brokers' accounts for the last  five years. Are you quite satisfied that the Committee acted properly in doing this?  And if the Committee, in your opinion, overstepped the line, would you initiate

some action?

4 This is a S enate matter and I would not interfere in any way.

You took a personal hand in negotiations with the Australian Medical  Association over doctors' fees. Last week, the Health Minister announced that  more than 20 per cent of Australian doctors were chargi ng more than the common  fee. Do you not believe that this indicates a breakdown in the Government's  Health Service?

ÃÂ I don't think so. But if I can tell you the facts. When I first saw the

bill that would have to be paid for the increase in doctors' fees, it was more than  $35 million, and after negotiations with them, we got it cut down to $9. 3 million  which our own Health authorities thought was reasonable and fair. So if that isn't

an achievement, I don't know what is. Secondly the AMA itself said it would try  and persuade doctors to accept the common fee and they are doing their best to  achieve that objective. Third, in the case of the specialist fees, they will not have

.../ll

an across-the-board increase. But what they will do is look at an anomalies and if  they want to get an increase, they have agreed to discuss the facts with us before  they make a decision. A ll in all, I think it is a remarkable achievement on the  part cf a new Minister and I personally would like to give him a pat on the back here  and now for his achievement, if I could add this to you, I am proud of the three of  them. f  .

Â·:' '

The question cf the Securities and Exchange Commission 3part, do you  believe that with the r ise  in the influence and work of Parliamentary Committees,  there should be some guidelines set down for the protection of witnesses?

I have submitted this to the Attorney- General. He is giving me a report  with the Leader of the House, Mr. Swartz, on the Parliamentary ^Committee system ,  particularly as it might relate to the House of Representatives, the Constitutional  position and guidelines as welL And also some guidelines relating to protection  of the individual, but I haven’t got the report yet and I won’t receive it for some  time.

Do you intend to widen the Committee system  in the House of  Representatives ?

Wait until I get the report, please.

The investment allowance, Prime Minister. You said the Government  would not restore it. Various elements in the business community have been very  anxious that it should be restored, and I would like to know when and why the  Government made the decision not to restore it. What effect do you think this will  have on the Armco steelworks at Jervis Bay?

One, we have not made any decision not to restore it. It is  suspended.  That is the first point I want to make. The second point -  the first question I  received was from you, David, David Solomon, relating to inflation. This is one  of the anti-inflation measures that we’ve got. And if you look at the latest statistics  relating to investment in plant and equipment from private sources, you will see that  the r ise  is a little bit alarming. And I could just add this now, too, the increase

in commercial building and industrial building is at boom levels and this has got to  taper off soon or we will have to be asking the industry why they can’t live up to  their prom ises to us.

I thought you said in answer to an earlier question it would not be  restored.

Well I didn’t mean permanently. I said perhaps. If I can explain it,  it is suspended. We have made no decision whatsoever with regard to ending the  suspension.

Regarding the Common Market, and Britain’s entry. Any opinions or  comment?

No, I can't. As you know, in one way or another over $360 million  worth of Australian exports into Continental countries - EEC countries - will be  involved. And it is Mr. Anthony’s intention or objective in his present visit to see  what arrangements he can make with British and EEC countries to try and get a  better transitional period as well as making arrangements for our raw m aterials.

I can’t add anything to that.

........./12

Do you accept it as inevitable that Britain will go into the Common Market?  Do you accept that?

ÃÂ I would never say that anything is inevitable, but knowing Mr. Heath as I know him, and I know him very well - I know he has got his heart set on it -  and he will be difficult to divert from getting into the EEC.

|. Â· While you made the point quite effectively that the agreement with the 1  doctors was very satisfactory from both the Government and the doctors' viewpoint, ; can you view it as satisfactory when your own Minister for Health says that 20 per cent are being charged more than the common fee? Isn't there some degree

of satisfaction needed for the patient as well as for fhe Government and the doctors?

M Yes, but there is a lot to be said, Mr. Reid, before you get to that

point of view. I don't like this 20 per cent and if I knew how to handle if, I. would  do so. At the moment I have got no recommendation before me, so I can't give you  a precise answer to your question. But there are two factors to be remembered. The first one is that we have decided that the direct cost to the patient, him or  herself, will not be more than 80 cents in the case of a surgery visit, $1.20 in the  case cf a home visit, or $5 in the case of any procedure - that is the total procedure.

So to that extent, the patient is protected. The second important point is that we  want the best medical service that we can get for all people including the  pensioners. And so far as I know, there will be no drop whatsoever, and perhaps  even an improvement, in the care and the attention given to the individual himself

or herself.

. Recently in a glorious display of the operations of democracy in this

country, two of our colleagues were hauled before the bar of the Senate and publicly  rebukÂ«3 for breach of privilege. You will recall that after the Frank Browne scandal,  Sir, Sir Robert Menzies undertook to review the privileges situation. Would you  be prepared to revive this tired promise?

ÃÂ I have done it already.

Â» In what way, Sir?

vl I have now asked - again I have got to refer, I am sorry, to the Attorney Ã¢ÂÂ

but I have asked the Attorney to prepare a Cabinet submission and to co-operate with  Others of my colleagues so  that I can take it to Cabinet.

. Sir, Australia's international reserves are currently at record levels.

It has been argued that this is a bit like stuffing a m attress full of money. Do you  intend to allow them to increase much further, or adopt any new policy with regard  to our reserves?

ÃÂ So far as I am concerned, as a former Treasurer and one who likes

to see this country develop, I welcome this money coming into the place. You can  never tell when adverse conditions might occur and it is pretty good to have  reserves of the kind that we have got at the moment. But it must be obvious that  I didn't make clear what I said in answer to a previous question of the probable

size, but not necessarily a detailed and precise siz e of the component. When  you look at those components, to a large extent they are building up the greatness  of this country. And if they build up the greatness of this country, then we should  welcome them.

1. Continuing with the doctors. You term  it a. remarkable achievement  that the doctors asked for $30-odd million and got $9 m illion...

'M $35 million.

). Is it not standard negotiating practice to ask for more than you expect

to get? Is that not just what the doctors have done?

'ÃÂ I don’t think so. They had their own formulas. They had statistics

presented. But if you don’t mind me putting this to you, I don't want to come here  and make this a debating society. It will ruin these discussions if I do. I am telling  you the facts. Everyone can make up their own mind whether they agree with  my conclusions or they don't.

). When Mr. Malcolm F raser resigned as Defence Minister, you revealed  that he had recommended, and his recommendation agreed with that of the Â·  Administrator of Papua and New Guinea, that the call-out order for the Pacific  Island Regiment should be revoked. I think we went so far as to suggest that it had

an element of illegality about it. Has in fact that order been revoked?

M As to the first part ctf your question , I was not aware that Mr. Malcolm

F raser had made that statement or that it might have had an element of illegality  about it. But I did discuss this m atter with.. . .

Interjection) He said it in the House,

M Did he? Oh, well, I don't always hear everything and I don't remember

that. But I did discuss this with the Minister for Defence, Mr. Gorton, sometime  ago, and instructions were then issued to revoke the order.

). It has been revoked?

M Yes.

). Prime Minister, in Townsville on Sunday, ABSCHOL, the National  Conference of Aboriginal Education, accused you of selling out the Queensland  aborigines in your arrangements with Mr. Bjelke-Petersen. Will Mr. Howson be  asked to look at those arrangements before they are initialled or agreed to by the  Commonwealth ?

M May I put the position to you as accurately as I can? Mr. Wentworth

put 11 recommendations to me that came from the Council of Aborigines in  Australia, that is, each of the Local Reserve Councils combining together to put  their recommendations to us. I thought these were authoritative, and the best  group that we could get recommendations from. And I was anxious that their

opinions and their recommendations should be put into effect. I took them up with  the Queensland Premier and his officials, and nine of them were agreed to - such  things as their right to leave the reserves if they wanted to, who should control  access again, and that was to be in the hands of the Reserve Councils - vagrancy,  the separate rights of the T orres Strait Islanders, control over their own assets,  and the supply of liquor and m atters of this kind. In every case, v/ith the

exception of two, we agreed with the requests of the Aboriginal Councils themselves.  In two cases, we had variations. In the case of alcohol, we thought they should . . . / H

14 .

have the right of local option, and the aborigines on the Mission or the Reserve  , itself should have the right to decide whether they wanted alcohol and under what  conditions. I think that is fair. We have local conditions, even in Melbourne,  that staid city. Secondly, we had one other problem that I felt the recommendations

made by the Queensland Government were right. And they thought that special  legislation should be introduced to protect aborigines who were given control over  their own assets and who were exploited by undesirable elements. In these bases,  special provision would be made to protect them. This is not discrimination. This

is protection in their favour. As to ABSCHOL, I am a little amazed that they  could make a comment at this stage, because as yet, they don't know the exact  details of what the Queensland Government is doing. They should wait until; they  know and until we are told. And if we are not satisfied, I will immediately  approach Mr. Bjelke-Petersen again.

3. It is not closed then, Sir?

PM No, of course it is not. But they couldn't be making a rational comment  about it because they don't know, I don't know, and the Queensland Government  itself doesn’t know today the exact term s of the bill they intend to introduce into  the House.

5. Sir, the Institute of Aboriginal Studies expects that as a result pf

financial hardship it might have to cut back its research programmes. Do you  feel this is something of an anomaly with regard to Government aboriginal policy?

PM You would have to say that again, I don't quite follow what you are  driving at.

5. The Institute of Aboriginal Studies is also being crimped by the general  cutbacks in Public Service spending, and may have to reduce its research programme.  Do you feel this is somewhat anomalous in view of the current concern with  aboriginal advancement and welfare?

3M It is not a justified concern of theirs. I don't think there is any

prospect of it happening.

5. Sir, we have just had the first Member of Parliament, an aboriginal,

elected here - he is on the verge of being elected. Do you foresee the time,  possibly, when an aborigine might even sit in the chair you occupy now? :

5M I had not thought of it, but it certainly is not out of the question.

). Prime Minister, you indicated earlier that you agreed with Mr Snedden  that the Budget would be a tough one. Without.. . . .

5M I didn't say that, I didn't make that comment about it. With great

respect to you, I said I had not used the phrase myself, Mr. Snedden had used.  I believed it was up to Mr. Snedden to carry out his own public relations operations  himself and I think he is doing it well.

In view of that, do you disagree with Mr. Snedden that the Budget  won't be a tough one?

/15

15 .

'ÃÂ I don't make any comment about it. Implicit in what I said is that I

will make no comment about his Budget. Look, could I put this to you. I don't  like people interfering with the Minister who is responsible not only for the  production of the Budget - under my supervision, of course, and with Cabinet  approval. I don't believe in people expressing their own personal views about it.

I have lived there for twenty-one years and this will be my twenty-first successive  Budget, and I want to give him a fair go to be able to explain it in his own term si ;  And when the Budget is delivered, to be able to assure the Australian people with;  the best support that I could give him, that it is in the interests of the nation and.

the interests of the individual as welL

J. Sir, did you always get a fair go with your Budgets?

*M Who was that now?

It was suggested in your recent term  as T reasurer that you yourself  were anticipating a tough Budget. This didn't come to pass. This gives rise  tb;  my question. Did you always get a fair go as T reasurer yourself with your  Budgets?

'M You know I wouldn't make a comment on a question of that kind.

On the question of the Budget, do you still hold hopes of giving a pension  increase? r

*M I will make no comment whatsoever about the Budget, other than ygu  can take it if I have made a statement in the past, I will be careftilly watching |p   see that what I said then was not forgotten. :L:

J. You are committed towards a pension increase aren't you, Sir?

'M Â·' Yes.

). Sir, what are your reactions to suggestions that public servants should

have greater freedom to make public statements, particularly in areas which are  not directly concerned with their own Department's work?

'M Here we get into an extremely difficult area because I don't know how  strong the movement is that increased rights should be given to civil and public  servants. Certainly they should not have a right to make public comment on any  matter at all with which they have been associated in policy or administrative  decisions. Secondly, there is another very big area that they previously mentioned  themselves - that they feel they would like to be able to make statements about.

Now, I don't feel they should make aratemenra-about people's incomes or their  private lives or what is likely to happen or the wav in which they think Budget  changes or other social changes should be made. But this~has been referred to the  Public ServiceTfoard for a recommendation to us. And the Council itself was asked

if it would make recommendations. So far they haven't made recommendations or  proposals to the Public Service Board. When they do and when the Public Service  Board let us know the facts, and what they recommend, we can have a detailed  look at it. Until then, we can't. But I do say this that the Public Service is in a  position where it must not be permitted to interfere with the rights of the individual

or discuss individual rights and privileges when they might have access to information,  that other people outside the public service might not have access to. Â£

>M v In Anticipation of this question, thinking it might be raised, I discussed I it with Mr. Swartz yesterday, and he has assured me that he has had negotiations  . with the interested parties and that he will shortly be submitting .either a letter  : to me or some recommendations to me which I will probably have to take to :

Cabinet.

5Â· i The submission has been ready to go before Cabinet for over a month,  V hasn't it?

That is not correct. - No. Â« i 5  ' . Â· Â»  ‘ ÃÂ½ ' ^ 5, Prime Minister, the Labor Party's Federal Conference in Launceston ; next month is to be open to the Press. The Liberal Party's Federal Council /Ã¢ÂÂ  Meeting in Canberra next week is not to be open to the Press. Is there any reason in your mind why the workings of the Liberal machine should not be open to public scrutiny as those of the Labor machine now are?5M There are two immense differences between the two parties. Despite what might have been said, the first one is that you well know that in a Labor Party Conference everything is arranged beforehand, and,........ (laughter) I know you laugh and you should too.. . .  and so you should it makes a farce of the whole business.. . .  but as you know at one, I think, probably two years ago decisions were made on a "yes" or "no" immediately the conference resumed. We don't do that. We in fact go in and discuss them at length. And the second critically important point - and this is the critical one - that our own organisation, while the custodian of principles, and a group that can make recommendations for them, cannot enforce those recommendations. The third point is we regard ourselves . as a national government^ And consequently while we examine in the closest detail and as sympathetically as we can recommendations and reports that come from the Liberal and the Country Parties, we don't regard them as decisive. We make up our minds in the national interest. But nonetheless, as Prime Minister, I yvill have a look next time we have an Executive Meeting - after we have a Council Meeting on Monday or Tuesday, I will raise this question myself.5. It is a fact also, Sir, that the New South Wales Liberal Conference is conducted in the same way as the ALP conference and does not seem to attract the disabilities that you suggest might be attracted in the Federal field. .

. The wool industry seems to be in a worse shape than every, despite the ' establishment of the Wool Commission and emergency aid grants the government  gave last year. Can you say what action the Government proposes to take now,  particularly in the light of decisions by many woolgrower organisations that the

industry needs a price of 40 cents a pound to survive? And will this mean more  Government money for the Wool Commission to allow to lift its reserve prices?

PM F irst of all, I think I should make it clear what Mr. Anthony did say.

He made two statements. The first one was that he believed woolgrowers’ "  organisations should get together and should themselves say what kind of action  they want the Government to take. But he equally made it plain that he didn’t

believe in subsidies. Thirdly he made it clear that he felt that the big woolbuyeys  of the world would accommodate a rise  in the floor price of wool if it were raised  by the Commission. It is not a matter I feel that I can enter into a debate about  at this time, but it is a matter under the closest scrutiny by officials and by /  the Government and when the appropriate time comes, I will be able to make a

statement about it.

Mr. Reid, you look a little puzzled about the answer to my question.  Now, in New South Wales the Liberal Party Council is not open to the public. I  have been at the last two, I think, and they were not open. ,

Q. Your speeches were reported, Sir, and so also was that of Mr. A,skin.

I took it on that - so also was much of the dialogue - either that or someone was  leaking like a sieve.. .  Â·

PM They were, too, you were quite right. Well they might just as well

have been open. A better way of putting it. Perhaps that is the way I should have  put it, too.

3. Sir, Mr. Anthony’s new-found abhorrence of subsidies.. .  Does

this mean there will be no more subsidies to the wool industry?

?M No, it doesn’t.

5- Next month, you will be facing up to the Prem iers again, and as you

know, the Commonwealth hand-outs to the States constitute about one-third df  the Budget outlays. Now in the coriext of Mr. Snedden’s statement that we will  have a tough Budget, does this mean it will be less likely that you will be able

to make some sort of supplementary allowance as has been made in the last few  years and to the Premiers this year?

3M I think you would know just as well as I do that I would not make

any statement about what is likely to happen or proposals that are likely to be put  by the Commonwealth to the State Governments at the Prem iers' Conference.  ITiere is no greater source of irritation than to be giving indications of what you  are likely to do at Prem iers’ Conferences. And as I want their goodwill and

cofoperation, I am not going to irritate them at this stage. They are the first  ones to hear what our proposals are. And the se cond point is, rather like the  Budget, I think you should hold your confidence until the last moment because you

can never anticipate what is likely to happen in this mobile country of ours.  Conditions can change so quickly.  , . , .  /18

18 .

Q. Does that mean then that Mr. Snedden's statement was perhaps a

. little premature?

PM No. It wasn't, and ÃÂª read carefully Mr. Snedden’s statement that he

made today. I think it is excellent.

Q. On China, Sir. You said the announcement had a greater effect

overseas than anything for. five years. Could you tell us what sort of effect they  had particularly?

PM No, I can't. I'm sorry. But I have watched the cables very

carefully and I have been informed of the various kinds of discussions that  have taken place and I can assure you that the statement that I made on the .  Thursday has been the subject of questions, that it has caused a great deal of

discussion overseas. Much of it, I think, very successful.

Q. President Nixon said about a month ago that he hoped to visit China.  Would you be in the same position?

PM When you add the other words that Mr. Nixon used... "in his lifetim e"...

don't ask me to be saying what kind of a mission I am likely to play at the  moment. I find I have got my hands full.

Q. Would you like to visit China?

PM Yes, I would.

Q. Any plans on that, Sir?

PM No, none. '

Q. Is Mr. Nixon coming here this year? .

PM Not that I know. ,

Q. Have you made any advance with your study of a growth tax for the

States for submission at the next Prem iers' Conference?

PM Yes, I think that draft papers will be submitted to me by the

Treasurer Mr. Snedden in the first week of next month.

Q. Can you give us any indication of what it will be?

PM No. .

. I was wondering how you reconcile your statement earlier this year on

Omega that it was not sufficiently accurate to be used by ballistic missile  *  submarines. In Admiral Zummalt's statement this week, he said theoretically it  could be used.

M Well Admiral Zummalt has said that. I got the text of what he said

today, but there are so many gaps in the tape recording of it that frankly I can't  quite make out what he did say. What he meant, anyhow. But can I put two -  proposals to you which are authoritative and come from the Americans in very,  very recent days. The first one is there is no receiver now known that can be  put into a ballistic missile type of submarine that can receive the Omega.

Secondly we have been assured by the United States Government that it has no  intention of putting Omega in any of its ballistic missile submarines and that ip  has no plans whatsoever to do so. And thirdly you can take it as absolutely positive;  that there are so many better systems, far far better systems than the Qmegp !  that there would be no reason why it ought to be included Now to me there is $

lot of nonsense about this debate. I would like to know whether those who are Ã¢ÂÂ    creating the debate want us to stop the Omega system in Australian waters for the  use of surface transport? It is a remarkably good system for merchant marine  and for that matter for naval purposes. And I have not heard anyone yet who.|jas

said they want to see it abandoned for these purposes. It has a lot of advantages,  and as I say, at the moment while it is theoretically possible in anti-ballistic %  m issile submarines, there is no intention of putting them in, and no receiver yet  capable of receiving the messages. *

. Sir, when you became Leader of the Liberal Party you spoke of the-

desire for a greater flow of information from the Government to the people and at  a National Press Club interview about six weeks ago, you spoke of an open door ,  policy. To some journalists it seems that in fact there hasn't been an increase  in the amount of flow of information, that it seems a long time between press  conferences. Is there any. reason why you can't follow the precedure which  State Premiers have of hav ing Press Conferences, perhaps even daily, I am not

suggesting they should be daily, that you would find it possible to have them  daily - perhaps weeldy. Or of briefing the press, I mean the Press Gallery,  on what happens after Cabinet meetings on decisions which have been firmly  taken?

ÃÂ As to the second part of your question, I think it is worthwhile studying

and I will put it to immediate study and make up my mind what ought to :be doge.  As to the substance of your question - it is time. I can't fit in anything more. T   would like you to have a look at my diary and see if you can get a better set of

priorities than my staff give. /

r . Barnes : Thank you very much Prime Minister. We hope it is not too long  before we see you again.

At the end of the press conference, the Prime Minister said he regretted there  had not been a question about Mrs. Burns.

. . . . /20

20 .

3Â· What were you going to say about Mrs. Burns?

This is the lady that owes the $7,000?

?M Well the answer is this. I can put it to you in two different components.

F irst of all, she has a right of appeal to a court if she wishes to exercise that right.  If she does we will pay her costs. We don't at the moment know whether she wants  to or not. Secondly, as to the amount she owes. When I was the T reasurer, I made  a decision that if a person has been overpaid, and can establish good faith in the  receipt of those moneys, that we will only insist upon the repayment of the amount  that was paid to them during the course of the last year. In her case, it would be

something of the order of $1,482, of which she has paid $538, leaving a residue  of $944. So to that extent we are prepared to negotiate with her, and we certainly  will not ask that our costs be paid by her. I thought I would get this question. I  was sure I would. And if l ean say so, I am rather glad because it shows how  human you are because it is the first time I have known you to have been off the

mark.
