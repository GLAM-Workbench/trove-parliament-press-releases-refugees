Â

Migrants will have access 
to more flexible and effective English language tuition in Tasmania 
following the signing of a new contract for the delivery of the Adult 
Migrant English Program (AMEP), the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

Â

The five year $2.5 million 
contract, between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
and the successful tenderer, the Adult Migrant English Service, was 
signed today at a special ceremony in Hobart.

Â

Mr Ruddock said English 
language ability is one of the key factors in the successful settlement 
of migrants into the Australian community.

Â

"Studies have shown 
that migrants with a low level of English language skill tend to have 
a poor employment experience and can face social isolation.

Â

"The new AMEP service 
delivery arrangements will provide better services for Tasmanian clients 
including more flexibility in service delivery options and better pathways 
to further study or employment".

Â

The ceremony also marked 
the achievement of an important milestone in the history of the AMEP 
program in Tasmania - the program's Fiftieth Anniversary.

Â

"The AMEP's 50 
years have been distinguished by many impressive achievements," 
Mr Ruddock said.

Â

"Since it began 
in 1948, the program has helped over 15,000 of Australia's new arrivals 
to learn English and settle in Tasmania.

Â

"The AMEP in Tasmania 
provides over 38,000 hours of English language tuition to around 200 
clients from over 40 language backgrounds each year.

Â

"It is acknowledged 
as a world-leading language program and is one of Australia's key migrant 
settlement services.

Â

"The AMEP has made 
a major contribution to the successful settlement of non-English speaking 
migrants and refugees and the maximisation of Australia's cultural diversity".

Â

The ceremony marking 
these achievements will be held on the MV Cartela ferry, at the Brooke 
St Pier, Franklin Wharf, Hobart.
