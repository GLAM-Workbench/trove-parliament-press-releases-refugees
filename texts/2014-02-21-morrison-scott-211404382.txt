Immigration Minister Scott Morrison

Longest Period Without Successful People Smuggling Venture  Since Labor Abolished Howard Policies - Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection

21-02-2014 -

The latest weekly update for Operation Sovereign Borders reveals there has not been a  successful people smuggling venture to Australia for sixty four days, the longest period  without a successful venture since before August 2008 when Labor started the boats, Minister  for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison said today.

Operation Sovereign Borders is making progress. The boats have not yet stopped but they are  stopping under the Abbott Government with people smugglers on the back foot and arrivals  down to levels not experienced since the days of the Howard Government.

The last people smuggling venture that made it to Australia and had all passengers handed  over to Australian immigration authorities was on December 19 last year, over nine weeks  ago.

1,847 people arrived on 32 illegal boats over the same 64 day period in 2012/13.

The full suite of measures the Coalition is implementing, including operations at sea, are  combining to prevent people smugglers from sending people on the dangerous boat journey  to Australia. These are policies the previous government never had the resolve, will or  interest in implementing.

Preventing people who arrived in Australia illegally by boat from being resettled in Australia  is one thing but preventing successful people smuggling ventures to Australia entirely is  another. The Coalition’s physical deterrence policies, particularly those at sea, are the  primary reason why the Government is achieving the outcomes it is.

Reports from the Malaysian Government on potential illegal arrivals departing Indonesia for  Malaysia and falling registrations of asylum seekers in Indonesia show the message is getting  through the region that the way to Australia is shut for illegal boat arrivals under the  Coalition Government.

The Government’s strong resolve on our borders remains. The Coalition Government will not  take a backward step in the fight against people smugglers.
