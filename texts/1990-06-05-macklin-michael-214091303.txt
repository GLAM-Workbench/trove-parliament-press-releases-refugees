WALSH RAISES QUESTIONS OVER ALP COMMITMENT TO FOREIGN AID

Australia's already meagre foreign aid budget is in danger of being slashed  further according to the Australian Democrats.

Democrats Leader, Senator Michael Macklin, said that former Finance  Minister, Senator Peter Walsh's derogatory comments about Australia's aid  program signalled a renewed attack against the already skimpy aid budget.

Senator Macklin today called on the Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, to  refute Walsh's claims and reaffirm the government's commitment to the  United Nations recommended level of 0.7% of GNP to the aid budget.

Senator Macklin said /'Since the ALP won government, the aid budget has  fallen dramatically from 0.51% in 1983 to only 0.33% of GNP in the current  budget. This is an appalling record and represents its lowest level for several  decades."

There must have been some interesting debates in the Cabinet room when  Foreign Minister Evans was pushing to increase aid to 0.4% of GNP while  Senator Walsh's economic rationalists turned the budgetary screws.

Obviously Senator Walsh has not read recent parliamentary reports which  highlight the cold hard economic benefits to the Australian economy from  our aid program.

For example, $600 million of the billion dollar aid budget was spent in  Australia last year, including the sale of $S0 million of wheat and other food  and $117 from the education, training and research sectors to the aid  program.

Senator Macklin said: "Senator Walsh shows how out of touch he is by  attacking the United Nations, while even this unsympathetic government  has increased support for important programs such as the UN Environment

Program and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees."
