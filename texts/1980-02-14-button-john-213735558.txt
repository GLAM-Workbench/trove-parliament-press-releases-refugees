STATEMENT BY THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE  SENATE, SENATOR JOHN BUTTON. ... n  p,

P R E S S  R E L E A S E The Prime Minister is more and more like the dummy to Tony Eggleton's ventrilB'ij^'^it.

Mr. Eggleton has written the script for Mr. Fraser's utterances

from now till the next election. Ã¢ÂÂ

Eggleton told the Prime Minister last November that he must

"neutralise" -- in other words, stop talking about -- six key Â·

areas of Australian life.

They are:  Â·

.Unemployment

.  The health scheme and its cost .

.  Unemployment a

.  The extravagance and indulgence of the Prime Minister and his

Government .  Ministerial propriety Â°  ÃÂ

.  Coalition relationships v

.  Refugees Its all contained in Mr. Eggleton's memorandum to Mr. Fraser

last November.

Mr. Eggleton, since that time, has no doubt added inflation,

z

interest rates^and fuel taxes to the list of' issues to be  ’ ’neutralised" .

The Eggleton memorandum has become^ a quite fascinating document

in the light of the Prime Minister's actions and utterances

since November.

When did we last hear him talking about the cost and muddle of

health services or the level of unemployment ? ^

We are not likely to hear anything from him about extravagance,

even though there are to be renovations made -- but paid for  after the election -- to his Boeing 707 "flying hotel."

And coalition relationships have not been improved by Mr. Anthony  clumsinesssduring the Prime Minister's absence overseas. Â·

Australians^,hpuld read all the Prime Minister's statements only

after reference to the Eggleton document. " That will enable them tp assess objectively the worth and relevant

of the things he is- saying.
