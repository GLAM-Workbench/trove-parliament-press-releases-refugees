MINISTER BRENDAN O’CONNOR - BORDER PROTECTION  COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

Border Protection Command today successfully intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel.

The Royal Australian Navy patrol boat HMAS Glenelg , operating under the control of Border Protection  Command, intercepted the vessel at 5.00 am (AEST) on 23 September in the contiguous zone north-west  of Christmas Island.

HMAS Glenelg  initially sighted the vessel at approximately 2.00 am (AEST) today, maintaining  surveillance until the vessel entered Australian waters.

Initial indications suggest 98 passengers are on board the vessel.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O’Connor, said situations around the world mean that large  numbers of displaced persons are looking for settlement and can be targeted by, and fall prey to, people  smugglers.

“According to the UNHCR 2008 Global Trends report, there were 42 million forcibly displaced persons  worldwide at the end of 2008, including 15.2 million refugees,” Mr O’Connor said.

The Australian Government encourages orderly migration and places a high priority on protecting  Australia’s borders from irregular maritime arrivals by maintaining an effective and visible tactical  response program of aerial, land and sea-based patrols.

“The tactical response program is delivered by a dynamic team of committed and talented officers at the  frontline, professionally trained and attuned to anticipate maritime threats and respond to various  contingencies,” said Mr O’Connor.

“The Australian Government Border Protection Command uses a combination of Customs and Border  Protection and Defence assets to deliver a coordinated national response to security threats in Australia’s  maritime domain.



“Border Protection Command operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and maintains a high level of  readiness, flexibility and initiative and is ready to deal with any threat within Australian waters.

“The Australian Government remains vigilant and committed to protecting Australia’s borders and  today’s successful interception by Border Protection Command continues to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the proactive response program in place.” Mr O’Connor said.

“The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity and health  checks as well as establish their reasons for travel.”
