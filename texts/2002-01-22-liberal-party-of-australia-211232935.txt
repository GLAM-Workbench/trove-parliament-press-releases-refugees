Doorstop Interview - Parliament House Canberra 22nd  January 2002

BRENDAN NELSON:

Firstly thanks very much for coming out to speak with me, I really appreciate that. Today the students who have applied for places in higher education in Victoria are increasingly becoming aware of whether or not they have been successful and the Commonwealth Government has been criticized by the Victorian Government for allegedly not meeting the expectations and needs of Victorian Students. There are a number of points that need to be made. The first is that this year we have had, pleasingly, an increase in demand for higher education places in Victoria and, indeed across Australia. Most pleasingly, there has been an increase in demand for places in teaching, in humanities and arts, and in Victoria especially increasing demand for nursing. For those students who are not successful in the first round of offer in succeeding in getting their choice of institution and of course, please remember there will be a second round offer the first week of February and you need also to ask yourself whether or not there is a place in a TAFE or a Vocational Education and Training position which might meet your needs and then 1, 2 or 3 years into that course you may find yourself able to reapply for a University place and get credit for the training that you have done in a TAFE or other Vocational Education and Training provider. Some students will also go into adult learning, and some students, of course, will make the decision to change their choice and take up a position in a course which has not been completely filled, whether it be in the state of Victoria or indeed in another institution throughout Australia. The Commonwealth Government has also made available over the last 6 years, almost $2billion more for Australian Universities. There are at least 35,000 more places for undergraduates in Australian Universities today than there were 5 and a half years ago, and in the state of Victoria, this year the Commonwealth Government will fund another 860 places that are fully funded in Victorian higher education institutions and another 765 in the 2 years beyond that. Universities are

autonomous, they are independent institutions, they manage their own affairs and a number of institutions this year have chosen to reduce the number of places that they are offering at the same time that the number of students who are applying to University have increased. We also ought to remind ourselves as Australians that, 10 years ago there were 100,000 students in this country who had applied for a place at University who were not successful. Last year it was less than 20,000 and of those who were not offered a place in the first round of offers, more than half were successful in the second round and of course of those who were ultimately not successful a number chose to go back and do their Victorian Certificate of Education or their Year 12 to varying degrees in some institutions, and others of course chose a place in a TAFE or Vocational Education and Training Institution.

JOURNALIST:

(inaudible) take a step back, the reports this morning about many students who are not finishing Year 12. Do you see that as a problem these days if students don’t get to the end of their secondary education or they reach University?

BRENDAN NELSON:

The most important thing that we need to do as a nation is to see that every Australian, every young Australian especially, is able to find and achieve his or her own potential - whatever that is. We want to create a culture where every student is encouraged and is able to complete his or her Year 12, but equally we want to make sure that students who feel that they are not equipped to complete Year 12, see options in New Apprenticeships, in Training and Vocational Education and Training as being equally legitimate to choices in higher education. There is nothing worse for any human being and for a young Australian growing up in this modern country to feel that you are being forced. To feel that in some way you are being pressured to study things which in your heart, you feel you are not equipped. There are many young Australians, unfortunately, whether they be in Universities or whether they be in other institutions of learning who feel a great sense of unease about what they are doing. The most important thing that we need to do is to see that young people be the best that they can be and that we do everything we can to help them to find who they are and achieve their own level in life.

JOURNALIST:

You (inaudible) there’s greater demand than actual places filled in Victoria you’re really telling in this case the Victorian Government - there may be the demand but it’s not up to the Federal Government to create (inaudible) University places.

BRENDAN NELSON:

Well there are 2 issues here. The first is that I have said to the Vice-Chancellors of Australian Universities and others who have a deep interest in and commitment to Universities that the status quo will be difficult to sustain if we want Australian Universities to maintain their standards of excellence and also to serve the economic and social expectations of the Australian community. I will be spending

much of this year in consultation with the higher education sector, the business community and those Australians whose taxes underwrite the $6.15billion that will go to Universities this year to develop a reform package which will take Australian Universities well into the 21st Century.  The second thing is that all states and the Victorian Government included have the discretion available to them, and I note a surplus that is available to the Victorian Government in this regard to make more funds available to Universities to offer more places if that is the decision of the Victorian Government. When Mr Kennett was the Premier of Victoria he made more places available in Victorian Universities, and funded those places. Equally, the Universities themselves, if they choose to, can fund more places and make them available. I notice the University of Melbourne is offering in total over $16million worth of scholarships to the elite of the elite students, as it has every right to do so. But equally it and other institutions, if they chose to could fund and offer more places and use a variety of mechanisms to do so. I received a report last week which found that between 35-40% of students who commence a University degree do not ultimately complete that course, for a variety of reasons. They might change institutions, they might find a job, they might decide that they’re going to change courses or be it for a complex variety of personal and family and economic reasons they decide not to complete the course. But there is a considerable investment in higher education by Australians and Australian taxpayers and I simply also say to those young people who are being made offers today for University places, please make sure that in your heart this is something that you want to do. That you are committed to doing it, and you have done everything you can to understand the complexity and the difficulty of what lies ahead in the University course, because if you aren’t fully committed to doing it - please reconsider because your place might be taken up by somebody who’s missed out in the first round of offer.

JOURNALIST:

What other options are there for people who have perhaps (inaudible) and don’t want to go to University (inaudible)?

BRENDAN NELSON:

Well there are a number of things, one of the most difficult choices you face as a young person is deciding in which direction you’ll take your life, in terms of education and training and ultimately your career prospects. Today young Australians in their mid-teens who have approached the first 25 years of the 21st century face a future in which they can and will change their career up to around 7 times before they ultimately retire. The choices that are available to young people are firstly, to do everything you can to see that you are able to educate yourself to the best of your own potential. To see that not only University and higher education courses but TAFE, Vocational Education and Training and new Apprenticeships currently undertaken by (inaudible) that these are the choices that are available to you and one of the proud records of the Howard Government, of course is to substantially increase, in fact double the amount of people in new Apprenticeships over the last 5 years. We don’t want to encourage, in any sense a culture of

mediocrity in this country, we are competing with the rest of the world, but at the same time, as Professor Ken Nunn said some young people are salmon and they want to get to the top of the waterfall, but there are many young people who want to find a quiet pond in the world and they should not have additional pressures placed upon them. On Friday afternoon I spent 2 or 3 hours with a  group of disengaged, disillusioned young people in Cabramatta in outer-western Sydney, and for them, they’re desperately with the help of social support agencies and Open Family trying to re-engage society and having outreach learning provided by a TAFE. We’ve got to see, and I said to them, that they are as important to us as Australians as are the elite of the elite who’ve scored a perfect score in their Year 12 and will go on to Universities. We just want to make sure that there’s a place for every young person in terms of finding their potential, we don’t want to say to any one person that they have (inaudible) than anybody else.

JOURNALIST:

But for years the states have being trying to increase retention rates, do you think you’re comments about Year 12 study undermine that process.

BRENDAN NELSON:

It’s absolutely critical that we do everything we can to increase, and certainly sustain Year 12 retention rates, and no more so is that challenge more pressing than for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. But at the same time that we’re trying to do the best we can to encourage our children to complete their Year 12, let’s not create an environment that says to a Year 9 or a Year 10 student and boys especially are feeling this at the moment, that if you don’t complete Year 12, that if you don’t go onto University then in some way that you and your life is less valuable than if you did. I want to make sure that young people are able to make choices, that they are informed in making those choices and that they don’t feel that in some way that because they don’t decide to go onto University that they are of lesser value than somebody that does. In fact many students who’ve chosen to do TAFE courses and Vocational Education and Training have said to me that they are pleased they made that choice and in modern society, modern Australia you can actually make that choice and now and then later in your life, in your late 20’s or your 30’s or your 40’s you can then decide that you would like to apply for a University course, and in fact the significant minority of those offers that are being made at the moment are being made to mature age students who have done just that.

JOURNALIST:

Have we really reached an appropriate retention rate targeting presently.

BRENDAN NELSON:

I think it’s very, it’s impossible to know or to set what you think is an ideal target. Ideally of course we would like every Australian to undertake and complete Year 12, but not all of us are equipped or indeed, do we want to complete Year 12. There

are some young people in this country who are dealing the most horrendous of family and social circumstances, for whom completion of Year 12 is to them a Utopian dream, and then if we compound their problems by sending them signals that say “if you don’t finish Year 12, you’re now not as important as somebody that has”, then we’d have to ask ourselves whether we’re actually making problems worse for them than we think. Today in the Victorian Press for example, is a story about solvent and glue sniffing by children as young as 11 or 12, I say to you if you say to those children for example, that if you don’t finish Year 12 then in some way you have failed yourself and you’ve failed modern Australia, are we actually helping children in those circumstances? What we want to do is say, we want you to be your best. We want to help you define what is best for you, we want you to stay at school as long as you possibly can, and in that regard the Government has established the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation and a variety of programs which enable young people, innovative programs, to stay at school, whilst at the same time doing Vocational Education and Training, in my portfolio I’ll be implementing the Government’s Election commitment for example to give employers incentive to take on Apprentices whilst they are still at school, and then incentives to keep those Apprentices once they’ve finished school. We do everything we can to see that young people get as much education as they possibly can, but let’s not in the process say to those who feel in their hearts, and know in their hearts, that they are not academically equipped to do so, let’s not send messages to them that says they’re not as good as somebody else who does.

JOURNALIST:

What’s your reaction to those reports of glue sniffing in Victoria, supervised glue sniffing and is there anything that the Federal Government can do given (inaudible).

BRENDAN NELSON:

Well as the Minister for Education, Science and Training I need to be careful about making unsolicited remarks about issues that are outside my specific portfolio, but I think all of us need to remember, and I say this as a person with some experience dealing with people affected by drug use and abuse, that there is no safe level for solvent sniffing or glue inhalation and I’m sure the authorities who are managing this problem are aware of that. Certainly the inhalation of any kind of solvent is not in any way going to improve or enhance the educational capabilities of those who are undertaking it . The authorities are of course dealing with an extremely complex and difficult issue and I think it’s sometimes easy for those of us from some distance to pass a judgement on what they’re doing. But (inaudible) I would want to be reassured that they have very good and very sound scientific reasons for the approach that they’re taking.

JOURNALIST:

Do you entirely support the treatment of asylum seekers at the Woomera Detention Centre?

BRENDAN NELSON:

I think, I’m certainly satisfied that the Government and Minister Ruddock in particular is doing everything that it possibly can to deal with people who have arrived in Australia illegally to deal with them in a humane and orderly manner, and I think Mr Ruddock is to be commended for the way in which he is dealing with what is the one of the most complex issues I think, the country has faced in its modern times.
