TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  BENNELONG CAMPAIGN OFFICE - SYDNEY

E&OE....................................................................................................................................

JOURNALIST:

Are you looking forward to the debate, Mr Howard?

HOWARD:

Yes very much so.

JOURNALIST:

Why do you think he backed down?

HOWARD:

I don’t want to talk about back-downs, I’m just delighted that democracy continues to  flow and that both of us will have the opportunity before a big television audience to  put our arguments and to be questioned by a very respected media identity.

JOURNALIST:

He says there might not be a second debate.

HOWARD:

Does he? He says a lot doesn't he? I mean, there are two leaders in this debate and  there are 18 million Australians, and there is one thing Paul Keating has got to  understand is that he doesn’t call the shots, he doesn’t  tell other people what they do,  other people have their own agendas, other people decide when it is appropriate for  them to do things and the idea that the Prime Minister just lays down the rules and  everybody rolls over and says “Yes sir,” is a view that is fast fading from the  Australian political scene.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating is going to release figures tomorrow about how they are going to fund  their election promises. Do you think that will be a disadvantage to you in this debate  tomorrow night?

HOWARD:

No.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating is claiming today that he has flushed you out and that he has forced you to  front on tliis debate. What’s your response to that?

HOWARD:

What was the second pan of the question?

JOURNALIST:

That he's flushed you out and made you front.

HOWARD;

He made me front? Oh...

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, are your costings actually finished?

HOWARD:

We’ll be releasing our costings at the right time.

JOURNALIST:

If they are finished, isn’t it limiting the time for the public to examine them by  holding them off for more than another week?

HOWARD:

We’ll release them at the right time.

JOURNALIST:

Won’t you be going on the back foot then tomorrow if the Prime Minister’s already  released his costings?

HOWARD:

Well, I think the big question about costings is why won’t  the Prime Minister throw  open the Treasury books. I mean, that is the big question. The big question is  whether the Forward Estimates for next year, which were released a few months ago,  as to whether they are still fair dinkum. Now, if they are M r dinkum, then the Prime  Minister should not be frightened to allow the secretary of the Treasury to brief the  Shadow Treasurer, and it would be very interesting to see whether the Prime Minister  and the Treasurer allow the Secretary o f the Treasury to brief the Treasurer about the  state o f the books. If he doesn’t, Australians are entitled to conclude that Paul  Keating has got something to hide. I’ve got a simple question. Mr Keating what have  you got to hide from the Australian public? What have you got to hide, Mr Keating?  Why won’t you let the books be examined by Peter Costello? Why do you reiuse to  allow the Australian public to be completely satisfied and assured that the Forward  Estimates for next year as published late last year are still valid, and while you  continue to do that Mr Keating you can’t blame the Australian public if it continues to  disbelieve you.

JOURNALIST:

What subjects would you like to debate tomorrow?

HOWARD:

Subjects of interest to Australians. It’s what the Australian public wants that counts  rather than what I want or Paul Keating wants. 1 think Australians want to hear from  me about youth unemployment, they want to hear my plans to reduce the current  account deficit, in other words they want to know what I can do to give them a greater  sense of security and to give their young families the more prospect o f getting jobs.

JOURNALIST:

How crucial is the debate to the election outcome?

HOWARD:

No one event in an election campaign is the defining moment or the crucial event. It’s  important. I’m pleased we’re having the debate. 1 always think it should be part o f a  campaign, I ’ve always been ready to debate, it is the other bloke who’s been backing  and filling and mucking around and welshing on deals - not me.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard is your immigration policy simply designed to neutralise any further  debate on the issues?

3

HOWARD:

Well, it wasn't designed to neutralise debate, it was designed to explain our attitude.

JOURNALIST:

Which is?

HOWARD;

Well, we believe in a non-discriminatory immigration policy. We don’t have any  plans to increase the number o f immigrants coming to Australia. We believe that the  level o f immigration from time to time should be dictated by and influenced by the  circumstances o f the country, particularly the economic circumstances o f the country.  We always believe that there should be a humanitarian component in our migrant  intake and we believe in an Australian society which is buiit on respect for cultural  diversity which is one o f our great strengths.

JOURNALIST:

Judi Moylan was quoted yesterday in BRW saying that the Coalition Government  would be prepared to restructure the whole o f the tax system. Is she wrong? Is the  Coalition prepared to restructure the tax system to cut paper work?

HOWARD;

Well, she has denied that. She has indicated that what she was talking about was in  the context o f reducing paperwork. The Coalition doesn’t have any plans to alter the  tax base - none whatsoever.

JOURNALIST:

Senator Bolkus says your immigration policy is discriminatory and a return to the  past, what do you say to that?

HOWARD;

Well, that’s just a He.

JOURNALIST:

What about the emphasis on people having better English before they’re allowed in?

HOWARD:

i '

Well, I don’t think that is discriminatory. It’s not used in a discriminatory way in the  policy and one of the good features o f the policy is that it will put more resources into  helping people who don’t speak english to speak english, because english is the  passport to success and progress in this country. It is the great cement of the  Australian community. It is our national language and people who can’t speak english  effectively will always be disadvantaged and I think it is very important that we place  an emphasis on that and it is to the benefit and to the future well-being o f recently  arrived people that they be helped to learn english and. learn it quickly.

JOURNALIST:

Would a Coalition Government reintroduce the oath o f allegiance to the Queen?

HOWARD;

We don’t have any plans to change the oath for citizenship purposes, no.

JOURNALIST:

What is wrong with the current ceremonies then? You say you want to change those?

HOWARD:

I think ceremonies can always be looked at and I think there is a certain need from  time to time to see if they can’t carry a little more occasion or a little more moment.  They vary a bit depending on who runs them. I’ve been to some very good ones over  the years and I’ve been to some pretty ordinary ones, but I think it is a very special  moment to change your country o f allegiance and I think the ceremonies should match  the moment. Sometimes when one goes to them one doesn’t feel that

Thank you.
