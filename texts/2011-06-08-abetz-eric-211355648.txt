No end to the Gillard Government’s reckless spending

Senate Estimates

Possums, Rabbits, Pot Plants and a Missing Submarine

In case you missed it

A fortnight of Senate Estimates has revealed a staggering mountain of Labor waste and there  seems to be no end to the Gillard GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs reckless spending.

Senate Estimates revealed that in recent months Julia Gillard spent more than $1,500.00 on  possum collars for a tree at Kirribilli House and $8,200.00 to remove another tree at the  Lodge. (1)

Keeping with the Ã¢ÂÂbuilding the horticultural revolutionÃ¢ÂÂ theme, thanks to Senator Mason, it  was also revealed that Labor has splurged more than $1,000,000.00 on pot plants for the  Department of Education. (2)

Are you sitting down yet? Well, if you are and you happen to work at Parliament House  youÃ¢ÂÂll be a lot more comfortable soon - Thanks to Steve Lewis in the Ã¢ÂÂteleÃ¢ÂÂ (3) we learned  that Labor is spending $11,000,000.00 on a furniture makeover for Parliament House which  led Senator Fifield to discover that the Government is forking out a whopping $3,400.00 of  taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money for each desk.

Over at Government House, the Governor General promised to cut back her $110,000.00  flower bill but refused to declare how much is spent on designer clothes. (4) Meanwhile back  at the Lodge we learned the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs boyfriend Tim Mathieson has been assigned a  Ã¢ÂÂpersonal assistantÃ¢ÂÂ to provide “on the road support”, whatever that means. (5)

Speaking of executive staffing, it was also revealed at Senate Estimates that the Prime  MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs former Chief of Staff Amanda Lampe is still on the payroll nearly four months  after she resigned, raking in a salary ranging between $146,000.00 - $225,000.00pa and a  taxpayer funded car. (6)

Over at The Department of Climate Change they spent $61,000.00 on a “dull green logo” for  the National Carbon Offset Standard which one brand strategy expert described as “neither  distinctive, nor memorable”. (7)

As Senator Abetz pointed out $61,000.00 is close to the average annual wage.

Health Department officials revealed that key elements of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs hospital reform agenda are  still not ready to be rolled out as promised with Ã¢ÂÂunexpectedÃ¢ÂÂ delays setting up the National  Health Performance Authority and contracts still to be signed for 15 Medicare locals due to  start next month. (8)

Whilst on the subject of Medicare locals, the following comment from Senator Fierravanti-Wells while questioning the Department is also worth noting; “I never really did get a  precise answer as to what a Medicare Local is. I must say, somebody summed it up the other  day in a conversation I was having. They said 'Is this a place where you can get a refund and  a beer.”

Health Department bureaucrats found themselves in an embarrassing muddle attempting to  establish exactly Ã¢ÂÂwhatÃ¢ÂÂ constitutes the definition of a hospital bed. Senate estimates revealed  that in NSW, Labor defined hospital beds as being recliner chairs, cots or bassinettes. When  asked what the CommonwealthÃ¢ÂÂs definition was, we were told “The Commonwealth was still  working on a uniform national definition of a bed.” … Ã¢ÂÂYes Sir HumphreyÃ¢ÂÂ. (9)

Treasury told Senator Cormann that more taxpayers will be worse off by the way the fringe  benefits tax is calculated on cars and that about 60 percent of people will pay more tax under  changes to the FBT. (10)

Senator Mason learned that Labor will have to install about 40,000 computers a month if it  wants to equip students with their much vaunted computers in schools program and deliver  on its promise. (11)

Senator Scullion uncovered shoddy construction associated with the Gillard GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  $670 million indigenous housing program. In one instance the only improvement made to a  property was the installation of a stainless steel sink, a stove, three ceiling fans, four light  switches and a water pipe. To quote Senator Scullion, “ItÃ¢ÂÂs a complete and utter joke.” (12)

During questioning by Senator Troeth it was revealed that, under LaborÃ¢ÂÂs $308 million set  top box scheme, pensioners who rent their homes will be left Ã¢ÂÂstaring at the staticÃ¢ÂÂ because  Labor wonÃ¢ÂÂt pay to make sure the TV aerial is compatible. (13)

Senator Birmingham questioned Government officials over the appointment of Mike Quigley  to NBN Co. Government officials revealed that the company doing the background check on  Mr Quigley did not consider it relevant to tell the Government about a multi million dollar  bribery scandal involving Mr QuigleyÃ¢ÂÂs former employer Alcatel-Lucent. (14)

Senator Williams unearthed a $7 billion dollar black hole in the budget to upgrade the Pacific  Highway duplication. Labor promised the highway would be duplicated by 2016. During  questioning by Senator Williams Departmental officials admitted the shortfall in funding is  currently between $6 and $7 billion in addition to the $750 million matched by the State  Government. (15)

It was also revealed that despite Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs promise during the election campaign that  Labor would fund $2.1 billion to build the Parramatta to Epping rail link; no business case for  the project has ever been submitted. (16)

We learned that LaborÃ¢ÂÂs own health insurer, Medibank Private is preparing for thousands of  its members to downgrade their insurance cover due to LaborÃ¢ÂÂs plans to change the health  insurance rebate. Medibank fears that 37,000 customers could axe their cover completely due  to LaborÃ¢ÂÂs proposed means test, four times the total number of dropouts estimated by  Treasury. (17)

Over at Immigration we discovered that despite the Department establishing a special team to  process fast tracked visa for foreign workers to help rebuild Queensland, just 23 visas have  been approved in the four months since the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs fanfare announcement. (18)

Senator Cash accused Labor of Ã¢ÂÂhidingÃ¢ÂÂ $129.97 million in the budget to set up a regional  processing centre in Papua New Guinea for asylum seekers, despite there being no draft  memorandum of understanding with PNG. (19)

Senator Abetz discovered that despite LaborÃ¢ÂÂs promise to fast-track their proposed detention  centre at Pontville in Tasmania, no plans have been formally approved, tenders have not been  called, aboriginal heritage issues were not addressed, a memorandum of understanding  between Defence and Immigration is not in place and LaborÃ¢ÂÂs announcement was made  without planning approval. (20)

Senator Abetz also discovered while asking questions of Comcare officials that Immigration  was warned about security inadequacies at the Villawood detention centre weeks before the  riots which caused $9 million dollars damage to the centre. (21)

Meanwhile over on Christmas Island it was revealed following questions from Senator  Brandis that the electrified fence designed to keep detainees Ã¢ÂÂdetainedÃ¢ÂÂ had not been turned  on since the centre opened in 2009. (22)

Further evidence that Labor has lost control of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs border protection is evidenced by  the discovery that ASIO no longer carries out security checks for the majority of asylum  seekers with that task being relegated to the Immigration Department instead. (23) Described  as Ã¢ÂÂsame day serviceÃ¢ÂÂ to speed up the process we learned that just 17 percent of asylum  seekers are now referred to ASIO for scrutiny.

Senator Mason uncovered that thousands of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs much vaunted Building the Education  Revolution projects have yet to be completed months after the deadlines to do so have passed  and three years on from the Global Financial Crisis. Of 10,697 projects under the BERÃ¢ÂÂs  Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, 2022 remain uncompleted.

Senator Abetz also discovered that $750,000.00 of taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money shelled out by Labor to  purchase rabbit bait as part of the Macquarie Island pest Eradication Program has been  wasted with the stockpile on the Island ruined by moisture. It was also revealed that almost a  thousand birds have died on the Island. (24)

Over at the ABC, AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs taxpayer funded broadcaster refused to release details of how  much it pays its radio and TV personalities. Senator McDonald pointed out that despite the  Ã¢ÂÂcloak of secrecyÃ¢ÂÂ surrounding ABC salaries ABC presenters were not adverse to  complaining about how much politicians are paid. (25)

We also learned that an episode of a Channel Nine program promoting the Australian Federal  Police was edited, effectively Ã¢ÂÂrubbing outÃ¢ÂÂ former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, scenes were  re-shot replacing him with Julia Gillard after the former Prime Minister was unceremoniously  dumped by his Labor colleagues. (26) A clash of egoÃ¢ÂÂs perhaps?

Speaking of being Ã¢ÂÂrubbed outÃ¢ÂÂ; Navy Chiefs have been left somewhat red faced when asked  by Senator Johnston about an article in Navy News which described the daring exploits of the  Australian Navy Submarine HMAS Dechaineux during a major naval exercise in the South  China Sea. (27)

Senator Johnson said it was “Like a scene from the film The Hunt for Red October, HMAS  ships Ballarat and Parramatta have been gliding through the waters of the South China Sea in  search of an enemy submarine (HMAS Dechaineux). Ballarat and Parramatta are the ears and  eyes of a coalition maritime task group that has been staked by HMAS Dechaineux.”

Unfortunately Navy News had written the article before the exercise had begun. The problem  was that HMAS Dechaineux, the only submarine tasked for the exercise, had broken down  leaving the four nations exercise embarrassingly short.

Perhaps given the examples of waste, mismanagement and reckless spending by the Labor  Government as outlined above, Julia Gillard and the rest of her Labor comrades should have  been on board. At least then theyÃ¢ÂÂd be able to say they Ã¢ÂÂwent down with the shipÃ¢ÂÂ.
