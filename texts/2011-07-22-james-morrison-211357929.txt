JASON MORRISON:

Mr Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning Jason.

JASON MORRISON:

Are these the kind of prices that you thought we’d get?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think it was pretty clear listening to your previous guest that what we’re going to get is not much  better and it’s going to be a lot more expensive and this is what happens when the Government spends $36  billion plus plus plus plus on what is a giant leap forward to the 1960s, a government telecommunications  infrastructure monopoly. I just think that we had a system, it wasn’t perfect, we could have built on what we  had. Instead you’ve got the Gillard Government coming in turning the whole world upside down. It’s going  to be expensive, it’s going to be very bureaucratic, it’s almost impossible to understand and at the end of the  day the money has been spent and nothing much has changed.

JASON MORRISON:

And let’s not forget too we’re ripping out what at the moment is perfectly good infrastructure that Mr  Hackett, who we had on a moment ago, could jump on now and provide an internet service that would be a  little slower but in fact probably far cheaper.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right, Jason. Look, you know, one of the really odious aspects of this deal - an aspect of it that  amounts to a form of vandalism in my view - is spending $11 or $12 billion to take Telstra’s existing  network out of commission and then of course there’s the existing Telstra Optus HFC networks which are

quite capable of providing 100 megabit speeds now and they apparently are being taken out as well. I mean,  basically we’re spending $36 billion plus plus plus to dig up lots of streets, to put in fibre to every home  whether it needs it or wants it or can afford to pay for it, and in the end very few people are going to notice  any significant difference.

JASON MORRISON:

Alright, look I guess, you know, the politics of this is always fun to kick around on and I approached this  morning the minister to come on and talk to us, he has something else on so he can’t be here but I’m sure  we’ll hear him across the day.

TONY ABBOTT:

Probably attacking News Limited, I suspect.

JASON MORRISON:

Well, I wanted to talk about that because I mean it’s interesting that the Communications Minister has found  himself to be kind of the media critic at the moment which I wouldn’t think is his job in that particular role.  Now, you know, he would probably think us questioning the price of the national broadband is just out there  generating more hatred towards the Government. This is a reality of what the price will be for something. Is  this an inappropriate discussion?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Jason, I just think that this is all of piece with a Government which spends a fortune on things, often  that haven’t been properly thought through, and in the end it doesn’t achieve what it sets out to achieve.  Now, I mean their NBN policy resembles their climate change policy, their carbon tax policy, in this respect,  a vast amount of spend to do what? Next to nothing if anything and that’s the problem with this  Government. They’re all announcement, they’re no follow-through. They’re all talk, they’re no thought. It’s  just the most inept, the most incompetent government in living memory. The only thing they can do  effectively is tax and spend.

JASON MORRISON:

I want to talk about this Malaysia deal too, the immigration deal. I believe this will work and it will work for  a time in sending a message, but it will work at a cost. Now, today’s Herald tells us that the Malaysia deal  will be signed on Monday. Do you think it will work once it’s done up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you know, it’s two and a half months now since this has been announced and there have been various  stories over the interim saying it’s going to be signed on next week or next month. So I’ll believe it when I  see it because this mob are so much better about saying what they are going to do than they are at actually  delivering. It hasn’t stopped the boats so far, Jason. I mean, since the deal was announced we’ve had ten  boats, more than 500 people. We’ve now got chaos and crisis in our detention centres. We’ve got 500 people  in limbo and there’s the prospect of sending people to Malaysia, a country which hasn’t signed the UN  refugee convention - so this is another broken promise for the Government - a country where people of  uncertain residential status apparently are regularly caned. So this is an incredibly brutal option and if the  Howard Government had ever contemplated something like this I hate to think of the righteous  denunciations that would have come from people who are now deadly silent towards this bad Government.

JASON MORRISON:
