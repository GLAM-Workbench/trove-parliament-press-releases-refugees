Fees for some immigration services would be introduced and  others increased from 1 October.

An application to migrate to Australia will cost $25 and a  further $75 for those who are finally processed. This  will contribute $2.5m in 1985-86, and $3.3m in a full  year,  towards the cost of Australia's immigration program.

Refugees will be exempt.

Applications for a declaration certificate of citizenship  will cost $30. This fee will reimburse $400,000 in  1985-86 ,  and $540,000 in a full year, towards the cost of  issuing certificates.

Registering citizenship by descent will cost $25. This  fee will.'contribute $200,000 in 1985-86 ,  and $270,000 in a  '  full year, towards the cost of keeping the register.

'  The total budget of the Department of Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs for 1985-86 is $ 165m, an increase of $7.4m  over 1984-85. Taking into account the savings from  changes -.to the Migrant Centres, expenditure is up $10.9m

or 7.1 per cent.

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr .   Hurford, said the Government was faced with the choice of  pruning services or recovering some of the costs from  people who used certain services. ,

He said the latter course had been chosen with some Ã¢ÂÂ    reluctance.

Without fees, increases in the Adult Migrant Education  Program, English-in-the-Workplace program and welfare  payments to refugee children without parents in Australia  (see Press Release 60/85) would have been impossible. Â·
