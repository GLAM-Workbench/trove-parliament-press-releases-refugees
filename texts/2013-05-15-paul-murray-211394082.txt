E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PAUL MURRAY:

Joining us this morning is the Leader of the Opposition, the man who the opinion polls believe will be our  next Prime Minister and the bloke who is going to have to clean up the Budget mess of Wayne Swan last  night. Tony Abbott, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Paul. Look, before we go on, please, I’m not taking anything for granted. The next election will be  hard fought. Yes, Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan are lousy at government but they’re very clever at cunning  politics and I’ve always said that winning government from opposition is like climbing Mount Everest.

PAUL MURRAY:

Alright. Now, as a political document, can you see that there were things released last night that are as much  about laying landmines for a potential future Abbott government as there is reforms to help them hold onto  government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve always said that this government are like a bad tenant trashing the house before they get evicted  and I’ve more recently added, not only are they trashing the place, they’re booby-trapping it for an incoming  tenant and I think, in general terms that’s true, but we are committed to the National Disability Insurance  Scheme and it is going to happen, it is an idea whose time has come. We will do it the right way not the  wrong way and the right way is in proper consultation with the states, not on this take it or leave it basis, not  on this chest-beating by the Prime Minister where she gets all the credit and the states end up paying for  most of it. So, we will do it the right way but it will be done.

PAUL MURRAY:

Now, what about the baby bonus? This was a heart of the former government. It’s been long considered to  be a line in the sand that the Liberals weren’t willing to step back from. How do you feel about it going?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s not so much how I feel about it, it’s more about how the people who are relying on it are going to  feel and the baby bonus is yet another one of those things that the current government promised never to  touch and of course, they’ve hardly stopped fiddling with it since they got in. It would be good if what  happened last night hadn’t happened or didn’t happen but we can’t make any commitments, Paul, until  we’ve had a chance to carefully analyse where we are fiscally and exactly what poison pills there are in this  Budget. So, I’m not making any commitments to oppose it or to restore it. We just need to carefully consider  the totality of this Budget and the totality of the budget crisis that this Budget has given us.

PAUL MURRAY:

So obviously we know that you don’t get to see the real books until after the election but obviously there are  bills that are going to go into the Parliament that are going to include these things. Will you support those  bills going through the Parliament, given what was announced last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, a couple of points. First of all, we have processes - party room processes and Shadow Cabinet  processes - that we should respect and one of the reasons why this government is in trouble is because they  haven’t respected the ordinary Cabinet process that former governments of both persuasions did. The second  point I make is there’s some $20 billion worth of expenditure reductions that were announced in the last  budget and earlier which still haven’t gone through the Parliament. So, there are a lot of things that the  Government announced last night which I suspect they’ll never get around to legislating. So, that creates  problems of its own but nevertheless Paul, one should remember that last night’s Budget was essentially a  political document, rather than an economic one.

PAUL MURRAY:

But obviously they have started to make some cuts in some areas. Have the begun to do the hard work that  the next government is going to have to do?

TONY ABBOTT:

What’s happened is they have promised a surplus so often, they have lamentably and shamefully failed to  deliver and I suppose out of a sense of embarrassment they’ve been forced to do more in this budget than  previously, but still nothing like enough given that, sure, there are tax increases and some spending  reductions, but there are also massive increases in spending as well. I mean, the Treasurer complains that  he’s been mugged on the revenue side - wrong. It’s a self-inflicted budgetary problem because spending is  up far more than revenue.

PAUL MURRAY:

Also, can you give me an idea. in a couple of years’ time, they claim that we’re going to have balanced  books but on one assumption, if one assumption is correct, that’s the only way we’re going get there and  that’s on illegal boat arrivals. Now, they say they it’s going to go from 2.1 to 2.9 and then in a couple of  years miraculously drop to 1.7.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and yet they have essentially surrendered when it comes to stopping the boats. They have no  answer other than to blame the Opposition and every day we get more boats and the numbers are going  dramatically up - they’re not even plateauing - they’re going dramatically up. So this is a running sore, not

just for the government but for our country because no serious country can allow itself to be taken for a ride  by people smugglers.

PAUL MURRAY:

But also I think that one of the poison pills inside this Budget and one that I don’t think the media frankly  have caught onto it at this time is this idea that there is about $900 million worth of tax deductions that  families make for out of pocket medical expenses. Now, these are the people who would be earning over  $70,000, they’re not the millionaires, these are the people who don’t qualify for this handout and that  handout and school kids bonus, so the only thing they can ever hope to deduct is a trip, say, to the specialist  or something like that. These people have been whacked.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, exactly, and one of the things that a lot of people have really resented from this government, from  quite early on in the piece and I think it would be exacerbated by last night’s Budget is this sense that  anyone earning more than $70,000 as a single or $100,000 as a family is somehow rolling in cash and rich.  Well, look, obviously there are people who are worse off but the idea that a family trying to pay a mortgage  and put kids through school and earning $100,000 a year in Sydney is somehow rich, it’s just untenable.

PAUL MURRAY:

Now, I know you’ve got to go, so couple of quick things away from the budget, including The Little Book  of Big Labor Waste that was out the other day. Part of that which always gets brought up is about  government advertising. This is one of my high horses. Can you do anything in the Parliament and will you  do anything in the Parliament to guarantee that there is no government advertising spending in the third year  of the electoral cycle because, fair dinkum, where we are right now and the Howard Government did it  wrong, this government is doing it wrong, fingers crossed that future governments don’t do it as well, which  is $50 million here, $25 million there, that stuff is offensive to people who are going to work right now.  What can be done to limit that in an election year?

TONY ABBOTT:

There is a certain amount of government advertising, really straight information campaigns and occasionally  public health warnings and so on which is justifiable, but you’re right, a lot of advertising by governments is  political advertising, slightly disguised and it’s very wrong and it shouldn’t happen. Now, if we simply ban  government advertising, we would be doing the nation a disservice. What you need is a sensible adult  government which understands the difference between an information campaign and a propaganda campaign  and doesn’t indulge in the propaganda ones.

PAUL MURRAY:

But isn’t the problem, though, that any government who says, look, trust us, you can say that in opposition  but when the stakes go up and you’re a chance of losing government, and I know that we’re jumping  forward a few points here, that’s when people, because it’s been demonstrated by both sides of politics, they  can’t be trusted?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I hear what you’re saying Paul and I know everyone says that they’ll be different but I have  never liked political advertising. You know, I remember the former government of which I was a part ran  taxpayer-funded advertising on the GST. I don’t know whether it was effective or not. Personally, I didn’t  think it was very effective. I think it was the sort of subject where people basically would get into it as much

as they thought necessary and they’d come to their own view without needing to be pushed one way or  another.

PAUL MURRAY:

So are you willing to say in a Julia Gillard fashion, there will be no Joe Cocker government ads under the  government I lead?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’ll certainly be no Joe Cocker ads under a government I lead, because even I think that’s passÃÂ©!

PAUL MURRAY:

Tony Abbott, thank you very much.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you. Thanks, Paul.
