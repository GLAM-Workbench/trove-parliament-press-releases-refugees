Media Release: World Refugee Day

June 20, 2018

Australia has much to lament this World Refugee Day, Greens Immigration Spokesperson Nick  McKim says.

“There are still hundreds of men, women and children trapped in detention on Manus Island and  Nauru because of Labor and the Liberals’ cruel policies,“ Senator McKim said.

“Meanwhile, Australia’s refugee intake remains completely inadequate.”

“This government is also attacking refugees and people seeking asylum here in Australia by  cutting financial support.”

“This World Refugee the Greens re-commit to our policy a refugee intake of 50,000 people per  year, and of an immediate end to offshore detention.”

“Australia needs a refugee policy that matches our values of humanity, fairness and  compassion.”
