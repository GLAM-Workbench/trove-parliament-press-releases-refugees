Note: This is an edited version of the address delivered by Mr Hardgrave at the National Press Club on

23 July 2003, Additional information about portfolio services has been included in this booklet.

To each of the many distinguished guests who are here, ladies and  gentlemen all, I think it’s important when we talk about Australia’s  cultural diversity to acknowledge the long-standing and strong cultures  and traditions of Aboriginal people and in particular today the Ngunnawal  people. They are the traditional custodians of this land.

I want to thank the National Press Club for convening this opportunity to

talk about what is happening in Australia today. I look around the room The Noli Gary Bardgrave MP -  and see SO many people who have come from other parts of Australia

you today.

This year marks the  25th anniversary of multiculturalism as official government policy It’s a fitting  time to reflect therefore on multiculturalism in 2003, how it has developed, and where it may be in  another 25 years.

because they themselves are practising what I hope I can talk about to  Multicullural Affairs

While the times and some of the rhetoric have certainly changed there are some core realities that  have not and I expect will never change.  In addressing these realities multiculturalism remains relevant, resilient and adaptable.

The success of multiculturalism means that in 25 years the words “Australian multiculturalism” could  well be superfluous and even redundant as a label. As we take the benefits of our cultural diversity for  granted perhaps we won’t need a badge like multicultural, instead we’ll just be more likely to talk  about our Australian society instead. This

is because multiculturalism is rapidly becoming mainstream,

a natural way of life for Australians.

I’ve been inspired by the views of over  1000 high school students at over 3 5  schools or more around

Australia I visited in the past year, since becoming Minister. I submit to you that Australia’s next  generation of leaders are telling me, “what’s the big deal about multiculturalism”, “we’re already  doing it, it’s part of our lives, everyday in the school yard”.

I think the future is indeed in very safe hands. Just as the women’s revolution over the past century has  heralded a transformation to our society, our migration experience in Australia is doing the same.

Australia of today has  200 different languages or more. The same number of countries of origin and  over 2 0  million stories to tell, and some have in fact, despite all of this, asked me how we can have  unity in diversity?

Well while we aren’t a nation of clones, and we don’t ask all people to be the same, diversity is never  promoted at the expense of unity.

I believe we are united by our common values, by Australian citizenship, and by our national identity

I also wonder how many of us baby boomers of my relatively youthful vintage, or maybe the generation  of my parents or older, would have imagined that the chop or the meat loaf with three vegies that we  grew up with would have become almost an exotic curiosity at dinner tables around Australia 30 or 40  years later, Or that our children would play with others who have come from such a wide range of

countries of origin. Or that Australian businesses would reap success by employing people with  language skills, international networks and new ways of working and producing results - such as more  secure jobs, more job opportunities, and new export industries, for all of us.

Multiculturalism, albeit,  I guess, under a different name, is something I grew up with. I believe in  people, in each person, in acceptance, in respect, in understanding. Indeed one of the reasons I was  attracted to my political party, the Liberal Party, was the belief of the value of each individual. In the  same way the individual is at the centre of our multicultural Australia. This Government is about  ensuring our policies are designed to meet the needs

of 100 per cent of the people, 100 per cent of

the time.

I witnessed the waves of migration to my neighbourhood from the British, the Irish, the Scottish -

which is my background - the Greek, the Italian, the Polish, the Dutch, the migrants who came to  Australia in the 50s and the 60s, to more recently, the Taiwanese, the Chinese, and more latterly, the  African refugee immigrants who have moved into my own electorate.

I’ve been aware for a long time that diversity has been a good thing for my electorate of Moreton, as  indeed  it has been for the whole of Australia.

New businesses have opened, houses have been built, more schools, places of worship, restaurants  -

they’ve all sprung up. It has in fact rejuvenated every aspect of my local community.

Australia has grown since my boyhood days of the  60s. We have become a thriving, cosmopolitan

innovative and complex society.

Now multicultural policies can claim some credit for  it, but I believe the Australian people as a whole

can claim most of the credit for it.

We have accepted, respected and incorporated the successive waves of migrants to our country with  relative ease. Almost half of all Australians today were born overseas, or have at least one parent  who was born in another country. Our diverse population and continued commitment to a non-  discriminatory migration program requires a policy response at the heart of my portfolio responsibilities.

Multiculturalism, citizenship and settlement are all linked by the common purpose of strengthening  our society and our nation, and fostering the equal participation of all individual Australians,

At the core of my portfolio responsibilities are individual respect, which is what multiculturalism is all  about, investment in people, the tool for integration into our society through settlement services, and  national unity, the promotion of shared values through Australian citizenship.

Each is needed to provide strength and security to our nation.

I

Twenty-five years ago the then Liberal Government accepted the 1978 report of the Review of Post

Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants. We all know it as the Galbally report.

In accepting that report the government adopted multiculturalism as a key concept in developing  government po  I icies.

Now multiculturalism was not a new idea in 1978. It had been discussed for some time and received  the support of both major political parties. In fact, five years earlier, and he’s here today, the then  Minister for Immigration,  AI Grassby had given support in a speech lo the concept of the “family of the

nation”, as a metaphor for a multicultural society.’

It is worth noting that  it was the 1978 evaluation of the

services we provided to migrants that gave rise to the  formal adoption of multiculturalism. I’ve recently released  an updated report, a report on the  Review of Settlement

Services for Migrants and Humanitariari Entrants which  examines further what we’ve learnt and how we provide  services in  2003. 1 ’ 1 1  return to that in detail later.

Members of the Tongan dance group  from Griffith Public School, NSW,  performed at a multicultural festival  at Griffith’s Memorial Park Gardens

on Harmony Day  2003.

Australia is one of the most successful  multicultural countries in the world  and has welcomed more than six  million migrants since

1945 to help

build our nation.

Multiculturalism has a history of being controversial policy.  It has been maligned and misunderstood, was used as a  tool for division and alienated some, yet  it has been seen

by others as a source of strength, and a lobbying point.

The biggest challenge is communicating that  multiculturalism  is not just a policy for “ethnic” people,  The Howard Government’s renewal of Australian  multiculturalism has made

it inclusive and relevant for all

Australians. If you like, for all of us.  Australian multiculturalism is a broad church. It places a  greater emphasis on national unity, English as the national  language, citizenship and the promotion of Australian values whilst  acknowledging the benefits brought by different cultures to Australia.

Multiculturalism

is again what it was always intended to be.

In addition, multiculturalism has increased Australia’s international  standing and reputation as one of only a few countries with managed  migration programs and an even smaller group  of countries with  coordinated settlement programs.

In 1981 multiculturalism was seen by the Government as about  diversity not division, about interaction not isolation, about cultural

and ethnic differences but set within a framework of shared fundamental values which enabled them  to co-exist on a complementary rather than competitive basis.*

Multicultural policy today also features the principles of respect, responsibilities and benefits for all  outlined by an earlier Liberal government.  It is still about ensuring that all Australians have the  opportunity to be active and equal participants in our society regardless of their cultural heritage.

People in this country are free to practice their traditions, speak their old languages, adhere to their  religions and wear whatever they like, within the law.

Multiculturalism is not a one-way street.  It is not about taking -it’s about giving, it’s about accepting.

As in  1978 we balance acceptance of diversity against an obligation to have an overriding loyalty to  Australia and its people and to share a common set of civic values.

All Australians are expected to value parliamentary democracy and the Australian Constitution,  freedom of speech and religion, the rule  of law, equality, and English as the national language.

While the principles have remained broadly the same, in the past  25 years there have been some

adjustments to multicultural policy. For instance, we now say explicitly that multiculturalism embraces  the heritage of Indigenous Australians, early European settlement and our Australian-grown customs.

Australian culture is dynamic.  It is a living, changing, interacting set of life patterns.

Our culture continues to be modified and enhanced by the arrival of many migrant groups.  It continues

to be developed by the evolution of ideas and customs within Australia, and of course by global  influences.

Criticism of multiculturalism has often reflected perceptions of the impact of our non-discriminatory  migration program.

In the mid

1990s Pauline Hanson built much of her platform by exploiting feeling against  multiculturalism as being about segregation, and she made it a rallying point for resentment of so-  called “special treatment”.

This was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of multiculturalism. But Hanson did reflect the  way the previous government had allowed multiculturalism to drift into ethno-specific funding and  favouritism.

This was always contrary to the Galbally Report, which established that a guiding principle of  multiculturalism must be that the needs of migrants should be met by programs and services available  to the whole community,

This approach is central to the Howard Government’s

Charter of PublicService in a Culturally Diverse

Society, released in 1998.

It is interesting to note that the UK and New Zealand are our top source countries of birth for settler  arrivals. Thirty years ago it was still the UK, followed by Yugoslavia -- and interestingly -- the United  States.

It is also interesting to note that Australia is developing one of the most diverse migrant profiles in the  world.

Migrants today come from a greater range of countries, They are coming for a broader range of  reasons, and are typically younger and better educated than ever before.

According to Professor Graeme Hugo, University of Adelaide, ‘the mix is broader and more educated  than

it has been, and one of the most diverse intakes in the world. Even in the US’, he says, ‘much of  the migration program is dominated by just a few countries’.  Well as the first  MP to walk out on Pauline Hanson’s comments on Asian migration in her maiden

speech, almost seven years ago, I know that now, as a nation, we are more united than ever. More  recent international challenges have in fact shown our  resilience.

Unity and security are much less of a problem in Australia  than most other countries. Australians are an  increasingly diverse people, but we are inclusive, and  we have shown a great capacity for accommodating new

differences.

We haven’t come this way by accident, but through  deliberate policy

- through the provision of settlement services and language training, an inclusive Australian citizenship law and policy - which I’ll return to shortly - and .the promotion of community harmony, and of course multiculturalism. We take a proactive, practical approach M r  Hardgrave and Chair Of the to our multicultural Australian society. Council for Multicultural Australia, Mr Benjamin Chowj at Harmony Day is Part of the Commonwealth In May, the government released an update of its multicultural policy, which included our strategic directions for the next three years3. celebrations in 2003.

Particularly since 1 I ~ e ~ t e ~ b e r  2001, we have recognised that

community harmony is not only an important safeguard to Australians domestically, but it underpins  our capacity to contribute effectively to international efforts to combat terrorism.

Now, more than ever before,  it is important to build on initiatives to enhance national unity Last month,  for instance, I was very pleased to launch the Australian Partnership of Ethnic and Religious  Organisations. This partnership is an important community-based response in this new age of terrorism.

The government is very supportive of these sorts of grassroots initiatives,

The Living in Harmony initiative  is another example of our support for the development of local,  community-based solutions t o  local problems and issues4.

It is worth pausing now to recall the forces that influenced the rise of multiculturalism during the  1970s.

* The post-war migration had brought increasing numbers of migrants who came from a range of  backgrounds as the so-called White Australia policy gradually eased,

* A completely non-discriminatory migration policy had been adopted.

* The policy of cultural ’assimilation’ had been abandoned, and the policy of mono-cultural  ‘integration’ was under pressure.

I reject ‘assimilation’. Australians did. The assimilation policy of the late 1940s, 50s and early 60s

expected that people from overseas - and indeed our Indigenous peoples - would have to shed their  cultural heritage and adopt ‘Australian ways’ as soon as possible.

It was discriminatory. It was devastating to so many individuals and I believe it also weakened our  possibilities as a nation.

The policy of the late  1960s and the early 1970s was not much better. And while it suggested there  was an element of choice - migrants could choose how to become a part of the social system - the  institutional pressures of the time meant that the choice was limited to just one: the dominant Anglo-  Australian cultural group.

Of course there’s no going back to those assimilation and mono-cultural integration policies of the  past. These policies just simply do not fit into the realities of Australia today.

But people change and they do pick up Australian ways. The government

is about producing positive

outcomes by investing in the tools people need through settlement to enable integration into our  cu  I t ur al I y diverse , mu It icu I t u r al society

igra ti0.U

Australia has been built on the back of migration, and the six million migrants who have come since  the Second World War have created the Australia we are today

Against this  it seems puzzling that some recent commentators, including the New South Wales Premier  Bob Carr, have recently entered the migration debate y suggesting that increased population due to  migration was the cause of infrastructure problems, rticularly in Sydney. These commentators fail  to acknowledge the direct benefits

of migration for the whole of Australia, including New South Wales.

In fact preliminary analysis by Access Economics, using today’s prices, estimates that if the 2002-03  migration program is continued over the next decade, the cumulative benefit to the Commonwealth  budget could be to the tune of some $30 billion.

This is backed up by Econotech research which suggests that if the 2002-03 migration program is maintained  until 2007-08, together with the increasingly strong focus on skilled migration and the many improvements  made to migration policy since 1996,

it will deliver an increase of $344 per head in living standards for all

Australians, compared to continuing with the pre-I996 migration program.

In the past  50 years of planned post-war migration, Australian has received six million migrants, and more  than 600,000 people under our humanitarian program.

Almost  a quarter of Australia’s 19.7 million people were born overseas. Galbally noted 25 years ago it was

a fifth of the population.

When the children of migrants are added, we find 43 per cent of us were  in fact born overseas or had at least one parent born overseas. We claim  around 200 ancestries, speak around  200 languages. Twenty-five years  ago it was 100 languages.  Virtually no other country comes close to the harmonious absorption of

so many people from so many places around the world - and I think only  two exceed it, Israel and Luxembourg,  Given these facts, we cannot return to policies that don’t value the cultural  heritage of all members of our community

It is not just a matter of justice

and human dignity, it is a matter of fad.  Our planned immigration process has been recognised by the recent

OECD Economic Survey of Australia, which says Australia’s immigration  policy has delivered economic benefits in part because of its emphasis on  skills and its successful approach to the settlement of new arrivals.

The OECD described Australia as an immigration country par excellence.  In a special chapter on the economics of migration, the  OECD found that  Australia’s current migration policies have been successful in improving  the economic return to Australia.

Professor John Salt of University College London has also praised Australia’s  immigration policy as ‘almost certainly the most informed migration policy  in the world’.

And an editorial in The Australian newspaper recently mirrored Professor  Salt’s optimism.

It stated: ‘We can have every confidence of newcomers  becoming successful, productive workers in far quicker time than their  predecessors in the huge wave of post-war migration. The immigration  program is working for Australia’.

Our migrntion program is designed to meet Australia’s economic, social,  environmental, and humanitarian interests. ?he migration program brings  to Australia people who are well lified, people with skills and experiences  who create

jobs and have help row OUT economy for decades,

The Howard Governrnent has re-balanced the Migration (non-  Humanitarian) Program from 29 per cent in the skilled stream when it  came to office in 1996, to 61 per cent in 2002-03. This means we have  more migrants with better English language skills, who have skills in areas  where there are national shortages and are able to contribute fully to  Australian society from day one, and create real benefits for all Australians.

But, as one of the luckiest countries in the world, the challenge for all of  us is to justify the privileges we have by choice or  by birth and assist those  fleeing genuine persecution.

Our Humanitarian Program also affords safe refuge to those determined  by the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees,  to need resettlement.

The offshore Humanitarian program is one  of the most

generous in the world on a per capita basis. This brings  with  it a range of enormous responsibilities to provide  additional assistance to people who do need it. It's a

costly obligation, but it returns on the investment in  time, both for the refugees, and of course for our  Australian society

Once settled and with or proceeding towards Australian  citizenship, we are all Australians whatever our  background. And even if migration were to stop today,  Australia would still be a diverse and multicultural society

And

it is up to all of us to work out how to get on with  each other in this very diverse cultural environment,

Mr Hardgrave visited the UNHCR's  refugee camp at Kakunia in northern  Kenya in 2003. Some of the people  he met at the camp have since been

resettled in Australia under the  Australian Government's annual  offshore Humanitarian Program,  which each year welcomes some

12,000 humanitarian entrants.

Our nation-building migration program is constantly renewing and reshaping Australia. So too are our nation-  building settlement programs. We invest over $200 million a year in our greatest resource - our people - via  our migrant settlement programs. The recent Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian  Ã¢ÂÂ¬ntrants ensures that we continue to be responsive to the settlement needs of individuals who make up the  changing face of Australia, and we are investing directly in Australia's future5.

In  2000-01, 45 per cent of migrants from our offshore humanitarian program came from Europe. The  following year it was down to 9 per cent. In 2001 -02,33 per cent of our intake came from Africa. In the years  ahead that number is going to continue to grow.

So things are going to keep changing, and all government programs must take into account the needs of these  emerging communities. It is an investment in the future that will pay dividends.  And, to this end, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet is chairing a high-level government task force  to ensure a greater coordinated effort across portfolios, to be even more responsive to the needs of our

diverse Australian community

As Galbally noted in 1978, settlement can be a difficult experience. Some come to our country suspicious  of government. Some feel let down, others oppressed, and sadly, some have been tortured by the  regime of their old country.

However good our migration program, strains in society can arise if people are unable to adjust to  their new circumstances, or

if they are marginalised economically or socially

These strains are especially likely to be felt by humanitarian entrants who may have little or no  English, low literacy in their own original language, and who may have spent many years in refugee  camps missing out on education and employment opportunities.

These are the characteristics of a number of people in Australia today, but particularly those who’ve  come from the Horn of Africa.

Earlier this year,

I visited the UNHCR’s refugee camp in Kakuma in northern Kenya. I did this in order  to better understand the refugee situation in the Horn of Africa and hence the circumstances of the  people from that region whom we resettle in Australia. It was a profoundly moving experience for me.

The camp was home to some  90,000 people, They’ve come from the most desperate circumstances  in the Sudan and Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and some more recently from Rwanda and Burundi.

I asked a group of young men from southern Sudan if they wanted to come to Australia, and almost  universally they said to me they would prefer that peace returned to their country so they could go  home. And sadly, for many of them, this may never be an option.

I was given a gift by a family from Ethiopia, who had been offered re-settlement to Australia a day or

so earlier. They were overjoyed with that news but they were also saddened by the fact that one of  their children was still missing. They did not know if they would ever see him again. The gift was a  hand-made pillowcase.

I felt and still feel very humbled by the generosity of these strangers in the most meagre of  circumstances, for whom hope was all they really had left.

At the same time, I felt enormously proud of Australia’s international re-settlement efforts and that,  per capita, we have one of the largest re-settlement programsof refugees and humanitarian entrants  in the world. And it’s only Canada and the United States that are ahead of us, according to figures  published by the UNHCR last year.

I say to the critics of our policy on unauthorised arrivals: it is critically important to remember that for  every visa granted onshore to people who can afford to engage people smugglers to get them to  Australia,  it is one less visa for these people languishing in refugee camps like Kakuma, and for whom  the offer of a re-settlement place is the only option available.

The Kakuma visit highlighted to me the need for  us to provide better information to refugees, but

particularly humanitarian entrants prior to their arrival in Australia,

To this end we will be piloting a pre-embarkation preparation program at Kakuma camp where  prospective migrants learn basic English and learn about Australia, its society and its values.

This is reinforced by the more values-focused publications of What if  Means to be an Australian Citizen and the Adult Migrant English  Program where migrants are taught about our national symbols, our  laws, the significance of important days like ANZAC Day, our political  system and even our national heroes.

But humanitarian entrants have strengths on which government policy  can and should build.

Research suggests that they report relatively high levels of satisfaction  with life in Australia. They have the highest citizenship intentions of  all new arrivals, and they experience significant success in learning  English.

Humanitarian entrants have historically been  an important source of intellectual, social and  cultural capital in this country, enriching our  nation as

a society, as well as making a  significant economic contribution.

An Adult Migrant English Program  class in the early 1980s. Nationally,  the Australian Government has  allocated more than

$500 million

over the next five years to the AMEP,  including $ 1  14 million this financial  year which will provide English  language tuition to its migrants and  refugees.

Effective settlement of humanitarian and other  new arrivals is clearly in the national interest.  We are committed to ensuring successful  settlement of migrants

so they can participate

equitably and fully in Australian society

Our investment in people  is multi faceted and

deliberate. It is not about separate development  but about services to facilitate full participation in our society by providing tools people need, and  therefore to bring forward the potential that each individual has to achieve his or her own personal  goals.

The way ahead perhaps involves established communities -those that have been here for decades

-

to play an even greater role as an experienced resource for new communities and indeed for the  broader Australian community

Under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy  (IHSS) - specialised services, including

torture and trauma counselling, are delivered on a contract basis by a range of community and some  commercial organisations, to eligible humanitarian entrants and refugees!

Government funding for Migrant Resource Centres and Service Agencies and Community Settlement  Services Scheme organisations help migrants and refugees

to find housing, enrol in English language

classes, find child-care, look for work, enrol children in schools, and provide basic information on  health, on education, on employment, on the law, and assist with referrals to government agencies on  all of these matters7.

Settlement information is provided in English and 22 other languages. The Adult Migrant English  Program provides up to 61 0 hours of initial English language training to newly arrived migrants and  refugees who do not have a functional level of English!?

The Translating and Interpreting Service provides an on-going interpreter service,  24 hours a day,

seven days a week through a national telephone numbersg

These are important services, and too few countries around the world have services like them.

Now

I want to emphasise that in our changing times, Australian  Citizenship is fundamental to our national unity, that it is  important to this unity that Australian Citizenship continues to  meet the challenges of our changing times.

The decision to become an Australian citizen has been made  by over 3.5 million migrants since the introduction of the  Australian Citizenship

Act in 1948.

Ninety-five per cent of our population are now citizens and  three quarters of those who have been born overseas have  acquired Australian citizenship.

This is a great indicator of the commitment to Australia by  those who have chosen to make this their new home.

It is a great encouragement to know that Australian citizenship  is strong and well equipped to serve our changing society

And we have changed.

Before the Citizenship  Act was introduced in 1948 we were British

subjects. Until 1973 we were both British subjects and Australian  citizens. After 1973 we became uniquely Australian citizens.

Mr Hardgrave with the Wang family  at their citizenship ceremony in Today, regardless of one's heritage, we are all able to share this

Brisbane, June 2003. same unique legal identity.

There are 900,000 people in Australia  who are eligible to become citizens, In marking the 25th anniversary of multiculturalism, we are also able  to reflect upon how Australian citizenship policy and law has kept  abreast of the changes in Australia's population.

Last year the  Act was changed to allow Australians to acquire  citizenship of another country without having to lose their Australian  citizenship. This recognises the growing number of mobile Australians  who wish to pursue employment, relationships and interests

in other

countries but still want to keep Australia firmly in their heart.

We will soon be celebrating our third Australian Citizenship Day on I 7  September. This is another great  opportunity for all Australians to reflect on the meaning and the importance of Australian citizenship.

Australian citizenship provides the perfect focus for all of us to celebrate the freedom and equity that  our democratic values provide for us.

The unity we have here, in Australia, maximises the benefits for everyone and is a significant protection  for national and individual security at all times

- especially in troubled times.

We are reminded almost every day when we turn on the news that not all places in the world are as  fortunate to have such a strong democratic value-base. Some countries and some groups do not  respect nor value diversity. Some groups fear diversity, and there are those

with different religions or

political views who are made to live in fear.

National cohesion in this context is at the point of a gun  - and is only rewarded by a fragile and

superficial unity,

Some refugees have told me they  did not understand the concept for instance of a free press when they  came to Australia. Frankly it took them some time to see that the press was not the mouthpiece of  government! There are days when we wish it were!

It does show, though, how sensitive the Australian media must be to not allow the creation of stereotypes  in our community by airing a range of views, not just the views of a few extremists.

We are very fortunate in this country to have a strong and healthy democracy.

Twenty-five years ago, the introduction to ,the Galbally Report began

with these words:

“We believe Australia is at a critical stage in the development of a cohesive, united, multicultural  nation. This has come about because  of a number of significant changes in recent years -

changes in the pattern of migration and the structure of our population, changes in attitudes  to migration and to our responsibilities for international refugees, changes in the needs of  large and growing numbers of ethnic groups in our community and changes in the roles of  governments and the community generally in responding to those needs.”’O

Those

25 year-old words might well equally apply to Australian society today.

The difference though  is that Australia’s multicultural, settlement and citizenship programs have  already given us a solid base for meeting community challenges more effectively than any other  country in the world.

We have produced a fairer, more stable and more harmonious society.  A society reaping the economic

rewards from using its diversity wisely, A society at peace with itself, confident that we are all committed  to Australia. A society united in its diversity  The outcome has been a united community  - our strongest source of national security.

us i

Australia and Australians are facing a number of major challenges to our national unity. The world has  been struck by violence in the form of fanaticism and prejudice. Our values and our society are being  challenged.

But Australian democracy is robust. It can cope with vigorous debate. It can grow through a contest of  ideas. These are no real threat to our Australian unity.

In

a free society people are able to disagree with the approach taken by the government of the day We  are free to say and to do as we please, so long as we recognise the rights of others to exercise the  same freedoms, and so long as any disagreement between us is contained within the bounds of our

laws and our shared civic values.

In this environment  it is critical that community harmony and  social cohesion are maintained. In support of national unity,  community harmony and social cohesion, Australia has strong  and coherent multicultural, settlement and citizenship policies.

These policies have served us well and continue to do

so. They

have proved to be flexible and adaptable to changing  circumstances and the changing character of the Australian  population. They are the buttresses of our cohesive society.  They are major a source of national strength, and they are  part of our continuing investment in nation-building.

They support the equal participation of all Australians in  our society. They support a united Australia and a united  Australian community that is one

of our greatest assets. Ensuring

that multiculturalism continues t o  succeed in supporting  Australia’s national unity for the next  25 years is a task for all of  us.

I believe we will meet it with the courage and resourcefulness that  characterises our people. After all, multiculturalism is synonymous  with Australia.  It is inseparable from our national identity. It has

become the Australian way of life.

Multiculturalism has been an amazingly successful and durable policy,  beyond perhaps the wildly optimistic dreams of its doting parents  and grandparents

- some of them are in the room today, such as  lerzy Zubrzycki.

It is not just about our history It  is not just about our present. It is

also our destiny

There is no doubt that Australia will continue to lead the way as a  shining example to the world as one  of the most successful and  harmonious multicultural nations the world has ever seen.
