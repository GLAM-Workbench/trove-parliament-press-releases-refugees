INTERVIEW WITH ASHLEIGH GILLON

SKY AM AGENDA

1 SEPTEMBER 2011

SUBJECTS: High Court decision

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Welcome back to the program. Joining me this morning on our panel of  politicians is Labor's David Bradbury and Liberal's Bruce Billson, gentlemen  good morning. David Bradbury let's start with you. The Opposition Leader  Tony Abbott has this morning put out a list of the top 25 Gillard failures. It  goes through the Malaysian Solution, the East Timor Solution, the Manus  Island Solution, the detention centres with riots and cost blowouts, it goes  on to the carbon tax and education revolution. It lists 25 issues here which  the Opposition says your Government is struggling on. Why should voters  have any faith in your Government after issues like the one we saw  yesterday with your plan for the country being struck down by the High  Court?

DAVID BRADBURY:

Well yesterday's decision is a matter of great disappointment for the  Government, that has been expressed by many Ministers and other  representatives of the Government. But in terms of the Government's  record, I note that Tony Abbott didn't mention the success the Government  had in steering the economy through the Global Financial Crisis. In fact,  the Stimulus Package which has managed to ensure that we maintain  unemployment at record low levels through a period of financial and  economic instability is something that we don't even talk about anymore. I  know that Tony Abbott doesn't want to talk about that because he was

asleep in the Parliament and didn't even vote on the package that came  before it...

GILLON:

Let's focus on the decision yesterday, we could rehash...

BRADBURY:

No, no but Ashleigh you didn't want to focus on the decision yesterday, you  wanted to focus in on a list that Tony Abbott has prepared. What I'm telling  you is that Tony Abbott did not have on that list the greatest achievement  of this Government, and it is one of the greatest achievements of any  Government in the world at the moment. That is, we managed to steer our  economy through global financial instability, maintaining record low levels  of unemployment and at the same time, ensuring that our debt levels are  at record low levels as well.

GILLON:

My point is though, this is a huge political blow for a Government that is  clearly struggling. How do you think the news of this decision would go  down in Western Sydney, for example, where there has been a lot of fear  about the influx of asylum seekers?

BRADBURY:

Well I think a lot of Australians would be very concerned about the decision  that was handed down yesterday. We've just heard from Margaret Kelly  about her concerns about the decision that the court has taken.

GILLON:

Do you think that the High Court got it wrong?

BRADBURY:

I'm not about to start passing judgement on the judgements handed down  by the highest court in the land, but I'll make a couple of observations.  One is that it's all good and well for courts to make decisions of the sort  that was made yesterday, but in the end it won't be members of the High  Court that take the phone call that Chris Bowen had to take after a boat  crashed into the rocks at Christmas Island. These are the political realities,  the day to day realities that Members of Parliament such as the Minister for  Immigration face. He sought to put together a proposal that I happen to

think would have been a very effective proposal if it was ever allowed to be  put in place. The decision that was made yesterday - and we've heard a  view from Margaret Kelly as to whether or not that was the appropriate  decision for the court to make - I think the bottom line is whether we like  it or not, whether it was the right decision or not, the unfortunate reality,  but the reality, is the decision that was handed down yesterday sends a  very bad message throughout the region and unfortunately will be a  decision that will be welcomed by people smugglers throughout our region.  That's what we have to now deal with, and we're intent on trying to deal  with that in a methodical and clear headed fashion.

GILLON:

Let's bring Bruce Billson in. Bruce, to what extent to do think these sorts of  legal decisions made in Australia spread throughout the region, how  quickly do you think that'll happen and are you expecting a huge spike in  boat arrivals?

BRUCE BILLSON:

Well we've seen reports of boats on the way. There were boats on the way  prior to the announcement of this decision. There have been boats on the  way ever since the Labor Government walked away from the solutions  which were the policies put in place by the previous Howard Government.  When the Howard Government lost office to the Labor Government there  were four people, Ashleigh, four people in immigration detention as a  consequence of arriving illegally by boat, four. Now what the Government  sought to do at every step of the way is ignore a system and a policy  approach which has worked, that has been consistently advocated by the  Coalition, that's understood within the region while it shopped around for  any other solution other than the one that's proven to work. The  Government said that its Malaysian Solution would break the business  model of the people smugglers. What it's done is break open the business  model of this Government where they don't think things through. They're  trying to deal in short term political games. You remember David was on a  patrol boat up in the north of Darwin in the election campaign to send a  message to the people of his Western Sydney electorate that people  smuggling is a concern and the Government will be tough on it. Well,  they're not tough on it; they're all over the place.  They should simply pick  up the policies we've been advocating.

GILLON:

Bruce, what's wrong with processing asylum seekers here in Australia? Of  course, the Greens have been arguing for that for a long time. It's such a  costly exercise to do off-shore processing, why not just do it in Australia?

BILLSON:

Well Ashleigh the facts have been proven to be quite different from what  you've described. The Nauru Solution combined with Temporary Protection  Visas and the suite of Howard Government policies was very cost effective,  it worked, and it also ensured that the big heart of Australia could bring  refugees to our country in an orderly way where we could properly assess  the threats and concerns and risk of persecution that refugee seekers were  facing and bring people to Australia in an orderly way. What's happened  here though is in abandoning those policies, the Labor Government has  said that another arrangement will arrive. If you can pay people  smugglers, if you can get to Australia, if you can invest tens of thousands  of dollars that people stuck in refugee camps who can't leave those camps  for fear of their life, they can't possibly imagine that kind of freedom. To  get on a boat and come to this region, they're stuck there and we should

be focussing on those in an orderly immigration process and re-install the  policies that actually worked under the Howard Government. But, the  Government won't do it. It's staring in the face of the solution and it just  wants to look everywhere else.

GILLON:

David Bradbury is the Government now going to consider abandoning off-shore processing as a policy?

BRADBURY:

These matters are the subject of ongoing discussion within the  Government. I'm not in any position to make announcements ahead of  Government making and taking those decisions in the appropriate way.  Can I make a couple of points about what Bruce has just said, the first one  is that at no stage did Bruce or his colleagues  ever vote against the  Government's proposals when we made the various changes to the  migration laws. The second point that I'd make is that if you believe the  interpretation of the judgement that people like Margaret Kelly have, then  what occurred yesterday in yesterday's judgement is that a torpedo has  been sunk into the heart of the notion of off-shore processing. Now if that  is the case, and I think that it is highly likely, that on the basis of  yesterday's judgement, had that legal action had been brought at any time  within the last decade, that the Pacific Solution as it then stood would have

been scuttled in the same way. This raises real questions for us as a  Government and as a community to confront the challenges of how we  tackle people smuggling and the flows of people throughout our region into  the future.

GILLON:

Very quickly, Bruce Billson?

BILLSON:

Ashleigh, that's just hysterical hyperbole. The provisions that were before  the High Court have been in place for a decade. They were introduced by  the Howard Government...

BRADBURY:

And they've never been challenged before.

BILLSON:

They sought to ensure the obligations and responsibilities we as a nation  have for those people seeking protection. If that protection process is in  part implemented off-shore, that doesn't negate the need to provide for  those protections. It's a simple, sound concept and the Government  should've known about it.

GILLON:

Okay we could keep debating this all day I'm sure. David Bradbury and  Bruce Billson thanks for your time.
