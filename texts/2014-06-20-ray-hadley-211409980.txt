RAY HADLEY:

Mr Abbott, good morning.

PRIME MINISTER:

Mate, itÃ¢ÂÂs lovely to be with you and it was lovely to hear the lady mayoress of Toowoomba talking so  movingly about this disease which is a terrible affliction, but sheÃ¢ÂÂs obviously handling it with enormous  courage.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, Prime Minister, we didnÃ¢ÂÂt ring you to talk about that or have contact with you about that but itÃ¢ÂÂs nice  that you should mention that because for the last 10 or 12 years since Scotty Gale first contracted it and  passed away, the great Rugby League player for Balmain, I was made aware of it and itÃ¢ÂÂs just terrible and  we need research dollars and Professor Rowe at the Macquarie University Hospital. We need the best  researchers, we have the best researchers, but theyÃ¢ÂÂre trying to pinch them off us all the time because one  day, I hope in my lifetime and certainly in yours, weÃ¢ÂÂll have an answer to this dreadful, dreadful affliction.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, look, youÃ¢ÂÂre dead right, Ray. I recently went to a dinner to help raise money and awareness to tackle  this. It is an awful, awful affliction, it really is and theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing great work at Macquarie University to try  to combat it and one of the reasons why the Commonwealth has put aside - ultimately it will be $20 billion  - in this Medical Research Future Fund is to help our really outstanding medical researchers to get on top of  this and many other terrible diseases because the money you spend on medical research has a tremendous  payoff in a year, a decade, a couple of decadesÃ¢ÂÂ time. The cures of tomorrow are the research of today and  thatÃ¢ÂÂs why itÃ¢ÂÂs so important that we get cracking.

RAY HADLEY:



I think that your wife has been at quite a number of functions. Is someone she knows affected by it because I  know sheÃ¢ÂÂs a great supporter of motor neurone disease research and trying to find the answers?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, Ray, you might have come across the former editor of The Australian David Armstrong. His wife Deb  Bailey died tragically of motor neurone disease about a decade ago and…

RAY HADLEY:

IÃ¢ÂÂve spoken about her, yes.

PRIME MINISTER:

… I watched Deb weaken and I saw myself how the disease progressed. In some cases itÃ¢ÂÂs slowish, in other  cases itÃ¢ÂÂs very rapid and with Deb it was pretty rapid and a very, very dynamic person was laid low and  ultimately left us in just about six months. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a terrible, terrible disease but itÃ¢ÂÂs not the only terrible disease,  but all of them - all of them - need more research and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why the Commonwealth is putting this Medical  Research Future Fund into place.

We have a real advantage as a nation when it comes to medical research; itÃ¢ÂÂs one of the things weÃ¢ÂÂre  particularly good at. WeÃ¢ÂÂre very good at everything to do with resources, weÃ¢ÂÂre very good at sport, weÃ¢ÂÂre  particularly good at medical research - I think weÃ¢ÂÂve had nine Nobel Prizes in medical research, I think four  out of 10 Australians of the Year over the last decade have been medical researchers including people like  Professor Ian Frazer who invented the Gardasil vaccine for cervical cancer. So, this is something that we  need to invest in and that was one of the changes in the recent Budget. The Budget hasnÃ¢ÂÂt always been  praised, but this is something very positive coming out of the recent Budget.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, what I appeal that people do in relation to that $7 levy, I appeal to people that if we get $20 billion that  might mean that your aunt, your uncle, your brother, your mother, your father, your sister, your brother  might not die of cancer or might not die of motor neurone disease or might not die of something else that  they would normally die of.

PRIME MINISTER:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, and I know that itÃ¢ÂÂs possible to support medical research but oppose the Medicare co-payment  but the truth is that everything we do, every dollar we spend has to come from somewhere and I think that  the modest co-payment that weÃ¢ÂÂre proposing to bring in, just like weÃ¢ÂÂve always had a modest co-payment for  the PBS, I think it will do good things; it will be good for the system and certainly itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a massive  boost to medical research.

RAY HADLEY:

Now, that leads to the next question and it flows onto the new Senate and getting these Budget measures  through the Upper House and thereÃ¢ÂÂs a front page story in The Financial Review today that some people  might say, Ã¢ÂÂdivide and conquerÃ¢ÂÂ others might be more charitable, but getting hold of the Palmer United Party  senators and dealing with them on a one-off basis and seeing if you can find some way to negotiate through  individuals as opposed to a collective. Does that have some traction?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Ray, look, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be talking to the crossbench in the Senate, both individually and collectively,  and I certainly expect to deal with the Palmer United Party senators and itÃ¢ÂÂs really up to them I guess  whether they want to deal with people collectively or individually. But, as I know with my own Senate team,  every Senator regards himself or herself as a proud representative of the state they come from and they all  have minds of their own and I daresay that the same will be true of the Palmer senators just as with the  Coalition senators.

RAY HADLEY:

Well letÃ¢ÂÂs hope there are minds in operation there in some cases, but I mean, IÃ¢ÂÂm sure that, you know, the  mention this morning from Mr Palmer that he might go after your senators is in vain and Senator Heffernan  and Senator Macdonald will no doubt find their way through the minefield. However, however, itÃ¢ÂÂs reported  today that youÃ¢ÂÂre about to sit down with Mr Palmer. You see, it must be very strange, not that youÃ¢ÂÂre a  confrontational person, but it must be very strange that you have to be so courteous and so understanding of  so many people as you negotiate your way through the minefield that is the new Senate that the  circumstances sometimes prevail whether youÃ¢ÂÂll sit in the same room of a person youÃ¢ÂÂd rather not be in the  same postcode of?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Ray, look, you have to interview all sorts of people, too, and I daresay there are some people who you  interview who you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt sit down and have a cup of coffee with…

RAY HADLEY:

No, no, well…

PRIME MINISTER:

… and youÃ¢ÂÂve got to interview them…

RAY HADLEY:

… Prime Minister, no, no, no. IÃ¢ÂÂve got to a level in life and an age in life when if Sarah Hanson-Young  threw herself at my beck and call, IÃ¢ÂÂd say, “IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, Sarah, my blood pressure will not allow me to talk to  you on the radio, I canÃ¢ÂÂt do it”. So I think that you are in a far more difficult position, particularly given  whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening at the moment than anyone else, let alone a broadcaster, about who you have to talk to and  who you have to be nice to. But at the end of the day, it must be very hard to deal with people who appear to  be moving in all sorts of directions at the same time.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a fair point but the truth is that thatÃ¢ÂÂs the way our system works. If governments want to get  their legislation through the Senate they invariably have to negotiate with the crossbench because not often  in recent times has a government had a majority in its own right in the Senate. The Fraser Government  briefly had a majority in the Senate, the Howard Government in its last term had a majority in the Senate; it  didnÃ¢ÂÂt make the Senate entirely pain-free for us but nevertheless, I guess we had some advantages then. But  governments typically have to do it and IÃ¢ÂÂll say this, Ray: anyone who has been elected by the Australian  people has to be treated with a degree of respect. Whether you dislike the person or like the person, whether  you agree with them or disagree with them, whether you think theyÃ¢ÂÂre easy to deal with or difficult to deal  with, the fact is the democratic process has produced them and so if you respect the public, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to  respect the people who the publicÃ¢ÂÂs elected.

RAY HADLEY:

See, I would think that thereÃ¢ÂÂs someone is the Senate that IÃ¢ÂÂve already mentioned today from your side of  politics, who could be the ultimate diplomat, who could gather the Palmer United Party and the others  together and just guide them through all of this in his own calm, inimitable way - IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about Bill  Heffernan. Either that or heÃ¢ÂÂd blow the joint up and youÃ¢ÂÂd have nothing left to work with!

PRIME MINISTER:

Well look, Bill does have a gift for friendship, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt about that…

RAY HADLEY:

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt about that! HeÃ¢ÂÂs also got a gift for getting offside with people!

PRIME MINISTER:

But the thing about Bill is heÃ¢ÂÂs an incredibly fair dinkum bloke. He tells you what he thinks in no uncertain  terms, but heÃ¢ÂÂs always prepared to take people as he finds them and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the things that  makes him a great human being as well as a very substantial person in the Senate.

RAY HADLEY:

So, can I take it as read heÃ¢ÂÂll be the moderator for you in the Senate?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, I think you can take it as read that Bill will have plenty to say one way or another to all of the  crossbench senators and thereÃ¢ÂÂll be much wisdom there that they can learn from.

RAY HADLEY:

Lock them in a room with him for half a day and see what happens!

PRIME MINISTER:

I mean, the official negotiations will always be done by the leadership team and by ministers, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs no  doubt that thereÃ¢ÂÂll be a lot of personal exchanges and thereÃ¢ÂÂll be a lot of bonds built and friendships formed  in the new Senate and I suspect that Bill will certainly be one who will build strong bonds with the new  senators.

RAY HADLEY:

When do you say Ã¢ÂÂenoughÃ¢ÂÂs enoughÃ¢ÂÂ and we go to a double dissolution? If it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work out, diplomacy  doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work, if they become recalcitrant, if they wonÃ¢ÂÂt in any way bend, what do you do then?

PRIME MINISTER:

My feeling, Ray, is that they will all want in the end to respect the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs mandate and they will all  in the end appreciate that the Government does have to govern. So, I think we will be able to work with this  Senate. In the end, of course we will one way or another do what we have to do to get our policies -  particularly our election commitments - through, but I donÃ¢ÂÂt think any Australian wants governments to rush  back to the polls. WeÃ¢ÂÂve had an election about nine months ago, the election I think provided the  Government with a very clear mandate on things like scrapping the carbon tax and scrapping the mining tax

5

and I think people expect the Parliament to get on with that, and sure thereÃ¢ÂÂs always a bit of theatre,  particularly with new parties and with independents and so on, but in the end I think the public will get what  they want which is a functioning government, an effective Parliament and an end to the carbon tax, the  mining tax and an end to debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see which is what they got from  the Labor Party.

RAY HADLEY:

When you were recently in America and having discussions with the American President, things seem to  have deteriorated in Iraq and theyÃ¢ÂÂre now sending 300 military advisers to work with local forces to combat  these extremists. What role, if any, will we play in that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, we havenÃ¢ÂÂt been asked as yet for any assistance. We are a very strong and close ally of the United  States and itÃ¢ÂÂs possible that we will be asked for help and obviously weÃ¢ÂÂll carefully consider any request that  we get. At the moment we are focused on ensuring that our people in Baghdad are safe and we are able to  respond the any eventuality in Baghdad itself. WeÃ¢ÂÂre also ensuring that our borders are secure. Secure  borders is not just a question of stopping the illegal boats that have been coming to our country under Labor,  itÃ¢ÂÂs also a question of ensuring that we donÃ¢ÂÂt get these jihadists coming back to our country trained up in the  techniques of death and destruction. I mean, one of the terrible, terrible things, Ray, is that there are up to  100 Australians who have apparently travelled to Syria and Iraq. Some of them are involved with this  murderous, murderous al Qaeda splinter group. Some of them are involved in atrocities and we are going to  do our damnedest to ensure that they never come back to this country and if there are some that we have to  take back, well we will make sure that they are not a threat to the Australian community.

RAY HADLEY:

So do you take your lead from what theyÃ¢ÂÂve done in the UK where once these people were going to Syria for  instance they just said well you are citizens but no longer and revoked the citizenship on the basis that  thereÃ¢ÂÂs a breach of internal security and a big problem? There are suggestions - I heard Alan Jones talking  about it yesterday - that perhaps our forces could become involved in identifying people who should not be  back here and special legislationÃ¢ÂÂs drawn up to prevent those people from coming back and their citizenship  is revoked on that basis?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, the important thing, Ray, is to ensure that as far as is humanly possible they donÃ¢ÂÂt come back into our  country and if they do come back into our country they are taken into detention because what we canÃ¢ÂÂt have  is trained killers - who hate our way of life, who hate us - making mischief with the potential to cause  mayhem in our country. We just canÃ¢ÂÂt have that. So, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the absolute determination of the Australian  Government: we will keep our borders secure, not just from illegal boats, but from returning jihadists as  well.

RAY HADLEY:

So have you spoken to the Opposition about possible bipartisan support for an idea like this? Surely no one  in Government, no one in Australia, could oppose the view that people like this canÃ¢ÂÂt be part of culture.

PRIME MINISTER:

Ray, look, the Opposition have certainly been offered a briefing, IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure whether thatÃ¢ÂÂs been taken up  as yet, but they sought a briefing, theyÃ¢ÂÂve been offered a briefing. IÃ¢ÂÂd imagine that they will be getting it

www.pm.gov.au

pretty quickly because letÃ¢ÂÂs give credit where itÃ¢ÂÂs due. I think that Bill Shorten is just as keen as I am to  ensure that when it comes to protecting our country against this kind of thing, we are of one mind.

RAY HADLEY:

Are you worried youÃ¢ÂÂre going to mock yourself? I saw you with Scott Morrison the other say talking about  you wonÃ¢ÂÂt declare it a success - Operation Sovereign Borders - despite the fact that six months since a boat  arrived. Are you a bit worried about coming out and saying weÃ¢ÂÂve done it and then one will come over the  horizon all of a sudden?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, weÃ¢ÂÂve got precautions in place to ensure that thatÃ¢ÂÂs not the case. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a strong cordon as part of  Operation Sovereign Borders and weÃ¢ÂÂve made it very clear that we reserve our right to take a whole range of  actions, including if necessary turning boats around. If the boats canÃ¢ÂÂt get to Australia, Ray, they donÃ¢ÂÂt  bother leaving Indonesia or Sri Lanka in the first place and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve done and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂll  continue to do and as I suspect you might have noted, yesterday marked six months without a successful  illegal people smuggling venture to Australia and in the same period under the former government we had  almost 200 boats and almost 13,000 people. So, that is strong evidence that the policies of the new  Government are working.

RAY HADLEY:

I was always confident it could be done, you just have to have the will to impose the necessary restraints to  stop it happening and thatÃ¢ÂÂs happened on two separate occasions. Now it happened under the Howard  Government, itÃ¢ÂÂs happened under the Abbott Government.

PRIME MINISTER:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right and you can rely on the Coalition to keep our country safe. WeÃ¢ÂÂre dedicated to national security  and to economic security. Economic security and national security were the dominant themes of the trip IÃ¢ÂÂve  just come back from to four countries because this is an uncertain world, sometimes the dangerous world,  and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why itÃ¢ÂÂs so important that our national security partnerships are in good shape and we are  constantly looking for more opportunities, Ray, to strengthen our economy, to create jobs, to become more  prosperous and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the objective of the Government.

RAY HADLEY:

One final thing, this High Court ruling yesterday about the school chaplain programme; I canÃ¢ÂÂt believe that  someone is so single-minded - the gentleman from the Darling Downs region - to go after this on two  separate occasions. YouÃ¢ÂÂve allocated $243 million in the Budget. I mean, wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt it be a simple matter  seeing theyÃ¢ÂÂve deemed it unconstitutional simply to give the money to the states and let them deal with this  matter in terms of schools chaplains? Because school chaplains, I mean even the gentleman opposing it  admits that itÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty good idea. I just donÃ¢ÂÂt understand why weÃ¢ÂÂve been to the High Court twice about it.

PRIME MINISTER:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing, Ray, weÃ¢ÂÂve been giving the money directly to the schools. That was what the  High Court found unconstitutional. WeÃ¢ÂÂre considering a range of options; we want the programme to  continue and if we have to go through the states, no doubt thatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂll end up doing, but the important  thing is to ensure that even going through the states the same quantum of spending gets the same quantum of  results and the difficulty with using the states as a middleman is that sometimes the states cream off some of  the money, sometimes the states want to impose their own conditions of things and we want to ensure that

7

this money really does produce chaplaincy services because there are already a range of counselling services  in schools and this is not just for general counselling, this is for chaplaincy.

RAY HADLEY:

I mean, and of course it should happen and should continue to happen. The only thing you donÃ¢ÂÂt want is a  BER-type system where the money gets frittered away on the way down to where it should be going if you  give it to some other agency.

PRIME MINISTER:

Exactly right. We want to try to ensure that the money goes precisely to the people to whom it is directed.

RAY HADLEY:

I suspect your security detail are telling you this as youÃ¢ÂÂre talking to me - this has just been passed to me  from the newsroom. A Melbourne Uni law building is in lockdown after more than two dozen protestors  tried to storm the building with your Foreign Minister Julie Bishop inside. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve been forced out by  security, but their buildingÃ¢ÂÂs gone into lockdown. So, most unpleasant that Ms Bishop should be subjected to  this yet again.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm just outside the Shepherd Centre and it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt look like thereÃ¢ÂÂs going to be any lockdown  here. They all look pretty friendly!

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, well youÃ¢ÂÂre opening that today. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an organisation giving deaf children a voice and theyÃ¢ÂÂve been doing  that for a long time and thereÃ¢ÂÂs a new centre to be opened, apparently?

PRIME MINISTER:

Two thousand youngsters have gone through The Shepherd Centre over the last 40 years and 90 per cent of  them have gone into mainstream education despite being profoundly deaf. So, this is a marvellous tribute to  the work of Bruce Shepherd and his late wife and itÃ¢ÂÂs been a tremendous service to thousands of families  and the least I can do is turn up and salute the good work thatÃ¢ÂÂs done here.

RAY HADLEY:

Thanks for your time as always, Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER:

Thank you so much, Ray.
