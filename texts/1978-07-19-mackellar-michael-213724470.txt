Australia's Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar, arrived in Bangkok last

night (Tuesday) for talks on refugees.

He will be exploring means of prompting

international action to solve the Indo-Chinese refugee '

problem.

His three-week mission to South-East Asia takes

in Jakarta, Singapore, Manila and Kuala Lumpur as well as

Bangkok.

"Refugees are the responsibility of the world, not

just of one country or even of one region," Mr MacKellar said

on arrival.

"There are now over 140,000 Indo-Chinese refugees

in South-East Asia and Australia. The size of the problem is

growing".

"The ASEAN countries, and especially Thailand and

Malaysia which are bearing the brunt of the initial refugee

outflow, are to be commended for their compassionate response

to a tragedy of human misfortune".

Mr MacKellar welcomed the recent statement by the

ASEAN foreign ministers calling for a more concerted

international effort to help resolve the Indo-Chinese refugee

problem.

"Australia has already accepted more than 11,000

refugees from the countries of Indo-China," he said.

immigration officials in Thailand to select and process

more refugees for resettlement".

Mr MacKellar said Australia's new immigration

policy, which he had announced recently, made provision for

a humanitarian response to the needs of refugeesÃ¢ÂÂ

It also renewed Australia's commitment to an

immigration policy applied universally without discrimination

on grounds of race, colour, nationality, decent,  national or

ethnic origin, religion or sex.
