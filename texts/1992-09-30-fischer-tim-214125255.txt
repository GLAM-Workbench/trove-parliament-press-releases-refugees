OFFICIAL OPENING OF 77TH NATIONAL CONGRESS  OF THE RETURNED AND SERVICES LEAGUE

Canberra  30 September 1992

MR PRESIDENT, YOUR EXCELLENCIES, SIR RODEN CUTLER VC, MINISTER

BEN HUMPHREYS, SENATOR JOHN COULTER AND OTHER PARLIAMENTARY

COLLEAGUES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: IT IS AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT TO

BE WITH YOU TODAY AT THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE 77TH NATIONAL

CONGRESS ON THE RSL .

I EXTEND TO YOU THE WARM GREETINGS OF THE LEADER OF THE

OPPOSITION, DR JOHN HEWSON, WHO SADLY CANNOT BE WITH YOU TODAY.

I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT OVER MY LONG POLITICAL CAREER IN BOTH

STATE AND FEDERAL POLITICS, ONE OF MY CLOSEST ASSOCIATIONS HAS

BEEN WITH THE EX-SERVICE COMMUNITY - IT IS AN ASSOCIATION THAT

I VALUE VERY GREATLY.

AS A VETERAN MYSELF, AND A FORMER SHADOW MINISTER FOR VETERANS'

AFFAIRS, I FEEL A VERY CLOSE AFFINITY TO THE EX-SERVICE COMMUNITY  AND THE RSL.

I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS WILL BE CONTINUED IN GOVERNMENT

AND THAT THE RSL CAN EXPECT FULL ACCESS TO A COALITION GOVERNMENT

AND BOTH SENATOR JOCELYN NEWMAN AND I ARE DETERMINED TO SEE THIS

HAPPEN.

ANY Ã¢Â‘ GOVERNMENT OF WHICH I AM A PART WILL ALWAYS HAVE ITS DOOR

OPEN TO THE RSL.

OF COURSE 1 THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WILL ALWAYS AGREE ON

DIFFERENT ISSUES. IT IS MY VIEW, HOWEVER, THAT AN INDICATION OF

THE MATURITY OF A RELATIONSHIP IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH PARTIES CAN

DISAGREE, BUT STILL KEEP DOORS OPEN AND STILL LISTEN TO THE

OTHERS' ARGUMENTS.

I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I DEEPLY VALUE THE WORK OF THE RSL.

IT IS NOT ALWAYS WORK THAT IS RECOGNISED ADEQUATELY BY EITHER .. THE

GOVERNMENT OR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE.

THE WORK OF THE RSL, IN TERMS OF RETIREMENT HOMES 1 VISITING

PROGRAMMES FOR COMRADES WHO HAVE BEEN HOSPITALISED, ITSÃ¢Â‘ ADVOCACY  WORK FOR THOSE SEEKING ADEQUATE COMPENSATION, AND OF COURSE ITS

REPRESENTATIONAL WORK IN PUTTING FORWARD THE VIEWS OF THE VETERAN  COMMUNITY TO GOVERNMENTS AT ALL LEVELS, IS A TESTAMENT TO ~HE

CALIBRE OF THE ORGANISATION AND ITS MEMBERS.

YOU, THE RSL, HAVE A RIGHT TO BE PROUD OF YOUR WORK ACROSS THE

WHOLE SPECTRUM OF RSL ACTIVITIES. IT IS SELFLESS WORK, AND IT

IS WORK IN THE VERY BEST TRADITIONS OF AUSTRALIAN MATESHIP.

I COMMEND THE RSL AND ITS OFFICERS AT ALL LEVELS.

2

THERE ARE THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE ALWAYS KEEN TO UNDERCUT

FIGURES OF AUTHORITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. THE RSL AT TIMES

COMES WITHIN THEIR FOCUS. TO THOSE WHO WOULD DENIGRATE THE RSL

OR DENIGRATE THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS, OR DENIGRATE THEIR RIGHT TO AN

OPINION - I WOULD SIMPLY REMIND THEM THAT SINCE 1914, HUNDREDS

OF THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIANS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED ON ACTIVE SERVICE

IN THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE.

88,534 OF THOSE AUSTRALIAN MEN AND WOMEN GAVE THEIR LIVES ON

ACTIVE SERVICE.

THERE ARE WELL OVER 400,000 WAR VETERANS IN AUSTRALIA TODAY - THE

RSL IS A REPRESENTATIVE VOICE OF THESE PEOPLE - A GROUPING

ENTITLED TO HAVING THEIR VIEWS HEARD AND A GROUPING OF

CONSIDERABLY GREATER SIZE THAN MANY GROUPS WHO HAVE A

DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE WITHIN THE POLITICAL DEBATE.

WHEN ATTENDING RSL FUNCTIONS I AM ALWAYS DRAWN TO THE MOTTO OF

THE RSL WHICH IS, I BELIEVE, OF ENDURING VALUE - "THE PRICE OF

LIBERTY IS ETERNAL VIGILANCE".

DEFENCE TRAJNING

IN THAT REGARD, I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU THAT THE

COALITION HAS DECIDED TO INCREASE SPENDING ON DEFENCE FORCE

TRAINING. WE WILL PROVIDE MORE FLYING TIME, SHIP STEAMING DAYS

AND TROOP TRAINING DAYS TO THOSE IN AUSTRALIA'S DEFENCE FORCES.

THE COALITION WILL INCREASE THE DEFENCE FORCE OPERATIONS AND

TRAINING BUDGET BY $20 MILLION IN OUR FIRST YEAR IN GOVERNMENT

AND $30 MILLION IN OUR SECOND YEAR.

I HAVE VISITED MANY DEFENCE FORCE BASES AROUND AUSTRALIA AND

CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED OVER THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN AIR

FORCE FLYING HOURS, NAVY DAYS AT SEA AND ARMY TRAINING DAYS.

I AM CONCERNED THAT CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE DEFENCE FORCE ARE

SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUATE FUNDING OF TRAINING. THERE

IS A DETERMINATION WITHIN THE COALITION TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES .  ..

AT THE SAME TIME 1 I HAVE TO SAY 1 THAT THERE IS A STRONG VIEW

WITHIN THE COALITION THAT THERE IS SCOPE FOR REDUCING THE NON "

COMBAT DEFENCE BUREAUCRACY. THIS WILL BE APPROACHED SENSITIVELY  BUT DETERMINEDLY SO THAT AUSTRALIA RECEIVES MORE CAPABILITIES

FROM THE DEFENCE DOLLAR.

I AM CONSCIOUS THAT POLITICIANS HAVE COME TO THE RSL IN THE PAST

SAYING THAT THEY WILL SPEND MORE MONEY ON DEFENCE TRAINING. I

WANT TO ASSURE THE RSL THAT OUR COMMITMENT IS BORN OUT OF OUR

RECOGNITION THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN REGARD TO TRAINING IS

BECOMING DANGEROUS. DANGEROUS BOTH IN TERMS OF AUSTRALIA'S

ONGOING SECURITY AND DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF SAFETY FOR THOSE MEN

AND WOMEN WITHIN THE DEFENCE FORCES.

:

I WOULD CITE AS INSTANCES THAT TOTAL FLYING HOURS FOR F-111

AIRCRAFT DECREASED BY OVER 500 HOURS IN 1990/91 COMPARED TO

1987/88 AND F-18 FLYING HOURS FELL BY OVER 200 HOURS IN 1990/91

COMPARED TO 1989/90.

MANY OF YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT FORMER RAAF PILOTS HAVE PUBLICLY

EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT RAAF FIGHTER PILOTS NOW AVERAGE

APPROXIMATELY 170 FLYING HOURS EACH YEAR COMPARED WITH 240 FLYING

HOURS SEVERAL YEARS AGO .

NORTHERN SURVEILLANCE

ALSO OF IMPORTANCE IN THE AREA OF DEFENCE IS THE ISSUE OF

NORTHERN SURVEILLANCE AND I HAVE THIS MORNING RETURNED FROM A

VISIT TO PORT MORESBY WHERE I DISCUSSED THE MISUSE OF THE

NORTHERN CORRIDOR TO AUSTRALIA, ESPECIALLY THROUGH SAIBAI ISLAND.

IN THIS AREA, AUSTRALIA'S SURVEILLANCE COVERAGE IS VERY LIMITED.

COASTWATCH IS WORRIED THAT IT WOULD BE UNABLE TO COPE WITH AN

INCREASE IN ATTEMPTED ILLEGAL ENTRIES. IN REPORTING ON THEIR

FAILURE TO LOCATE A VESSEL CARRYING CHINESE BOAT PEOPLE WHICH

LANDED AT MONTAGUE SOUND IN THE KIMBERLEY REGION IN DECEMBER

19 91, COASTWATCH ARGUED THAT: 'WERE SUSPECT ILLEGAL ENTRANT

VESSEL ARRIVALS TO BECOME A MORE REGULAR OCCURRENCE AND TARGET

WIDER AREAS OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA, IT IS UNLIKELY COASTWATCH

COULD PROVIDE THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR NORTH WESTERN

AUSTRALIA'  "

THE SAME REPORT LATER SAID THAT CUSTOMS OFFICIALS 'BELIEVE IT

MORE LIKELY ARRIVALS WILL INCREASE'  "

IT IS CLEAR THAT A MAJOR ATTEMPT MUST BE MADE TO IMPROVE OUR

SURVEILLANCE COVERAGE OF THE NORTH. I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE

COALITION WILL GIVE A HIGHER PRIORITY TO INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION

AND INFORMATION SHARING, WHICH WILL GIVE US GREATER NOTIFICATION

OF SHIP MOVEMENTS TO OUR NORTH.

WE WILL ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION ON SHIP

MOVEMENTS WITH INDONESIA. OUR MAIN DIFFICULTIES WITH THE CHINESE

BOAT LAST DECEMBER CAME FROM A FAILURE TO DETECT THAT THE SHIP

HAD LEFT INDONESIA ON THE LAST LEG OF ITS JOURNEY.

THE PROSPECTS FOR INCREASING COOPERATION WITH INDONESIA ARE GOOD.

BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREATER TRANSPARENCY OF SHIP

MOVEMENTS IN THE TIMOR AND ARAFURA SEAS.

ALSO, THE COALITION WILL GIVE GREATER EMPHASIS AND FINANCIAL

SUPPORT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH CAN

BE USED TO DETECT SHIP MOVEMENTS.

SHADOW DEFENCE MINISTER, ALEXANDER DOWNER, IS CURRENTLY

FINALISING THE COALITION DEFENCE POLICY.

AUSTRALIA/JAPAN RELATIONSHIP

IN 1992, FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF SINGAPORE, THE BATTLE OF

THE CORAL SEA AND THE BATTLE OF AUSTRALIA, IT IS NECESSARY THAT

AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN HAVE A FORWARD FOCUS.

HOWEVER, THE PASSAGE OF TIME DOES NOT LESSEN THE HORRIFIC EVENTS

OF WORLD WAR I I .

AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND  WILL HAVE AN EXPANDING ECONOMIC FOCUS WHICH DATES BACK IN PART

TO 1957 WHEN JOHN MCEWEN NEGOTIATED THE AUSTRALIA-JAPAN TRADE

TREATY.

IN THIS CONTEXT, I SEEK TO RESTATE AND CLARIFY RECENT REMARKS I

MADE AND THE COMMENTARY WHICH HAS FOLLOWED, ON THE ISSUE OF THE

EMPEROR OF JAPAN VISITING AUSTRALIA - A VISIT, I REPEAT, I WOULD  WELCOME.

IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT THE ISSUE HAS BECOME MARKEDLY DISTORTED IN

THE PUBLIC DEBATE, PARTICULARLY THE 'APOLOGY' ISSUE.

SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ME INTERVIEWED BY MR LAURIE OAKES ON

THE CHANNEL 9 'SUNDAY' PROGRAMME. MR OAKES ASKED ME THE

QUESTION, AND I QUOTE:

"SOME EX-SERVICEMEN BELIEVE THAT IF THE EMPEROR COMES HERE

HE SHOULD APOLOGISE BECAUSE OF WORLD WAR II. DO YOU AGREE

WITH THAT?"

BEING AWARE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE

AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, AND ALSO IN JAPAN 1 AND ALSO BECAUSE OF MY

LONG HELD BELIEFS ON THIS MATTER, I ANSWERED AS FOLLOWS:

"IT'S NOT AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION TO OBTAIN DURING THE  COURSE OF AN OFFICIAL VISIT SOME FORM OF APOLOGY, OF

RECOGNITION, OF THE GREAT AGONY AND HORRIFIC CRIMES WROUGHT  BY THE JAPANESE OF 50 YEARS AGO ON SO MANY AUSTRALIANS AND

SO MANY AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR ON THE BURMA DEATH

RAILWAY AND ELSEWHERE. "

CAREFULLY CHOSEN WORDS, I THOUGHT - WORDS WHICH INDICATED MY

SENSITIVITY TO THE ISSUES - BUT ALSO A RECOGNITION OF THE STRONG

FEELINGS OF MANY AUSTRALIANS, ESPECIALLY OUR EX-SERVICEMEN, ON

THIS DELICATE ISSUE.

FOR THE RECORD, NOW THAT I AM BACK FROM PAPUA NEW GUINEA, I POINT

OUT THAT AT NO STAGE DID I 'DEMAND' AN APOLOGY AS HAS BEEN

REPORTED, OR PLACE AN APOLOGY AS A CONDITION ON ANY VISIT BY THE

EMPEROR OF JAPAN.

I REITERATE 1 AS I SAID IN MY INTERVIEW 1 THAT A VISIT BY THE

EMPEROR WOULD BE MOST WELCOME.

. "

ON THE RELATED ISSUE OF DEFENCE COOPERATION, AUSTRALIA SHOULD

PROCEED WITH CAUTION; CERTAINLY AUSTRALIA SHOULD NOT BE FORCING  THE PACE OF THE ISSUE.

CONCLQSIOR

IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON THREE ISSUES RELATING TO

COALITION POLICY. FIRSTLY, IN RELATION TO FIGHTBACK I EMPHASISE  THAT THERE WILL BE AN 8% INCREASE, NO IFS, NO BUTS, IN ALL

SERVICE PENSIONS, IN WAR WIDOWS PENSIONS AND IN AGED PENSIONS,

CONSEQUENT UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GST. THIS WILL ALMOST

DOUBLE THE CPI INCREASE FLOWING FROM THE GST AND THE PENSION

INCREASE IS AN ABSOLUTE; IT IS A KEY PART OF FIGHTBACK NOT WELL

KNOWN - BUT WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED.

SECONDLY, IN THE 1988 COALITION VETERANS' AFFAIRS POLICY, OUR

POSITION ON THE FLAG WAS MADE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, AND I QUOTE FROM

THE POLICY - "THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES STRONGLY SUPPORT

THE RETENTION OF THE NATIONAL FLAG ... AND WILL BRING FORWARD

LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE THAT OUR NATIONAL FLAG CANNOT BE CHANGED

OTHER THAN BY WAY OF REFERENDUM."

LASTLY, AND I AGAIN QUOTE - "THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL PARTIES

REITERATE THAT THE DEBT OF A FREE SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS TO ITS EX "

SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN IS NOT SIMPLY AND TOTALLY AN ISSUE OF AGE

AND OR INCAPACITY, BUT ALSO TO PARTIAL DISRUPTION FROM A

LIFESTYLE AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF EXTREMES OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL

RISK. "

FURTHER, THE POLICY STATES "IT IS OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE THAT

THE VETERAN, AND PARTICULARLY THE VETERAN IN NEED, BE TREATED

WITH THE GREATEST UNDERSTANDING, RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT THAT

RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD, ADMINISTERED BY A SEPARATE,  MODERN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' AFFAIRS. "

THOSE ISSUES ARE AS RELEVANT TODAY AS THEY WERE WHEN THIS POLICY

WAS DRAFTED.

I WANT TO ASSURE THE RSL THAT ANY GOVERNMENT OF WHICH I AM A PART

WILL PLACE VETERANS' AFFAIRS AMONGST THE HIGHEST OF ITS

PRIORITIES 1 AND WILL RECOGNISE THAT VETERANS' AFFAIRS ISSUES ~  NOT ISSUES OF WELFARE BUT RATHER OF COMPENSATION AND COMPASSION.

AGAIN, I THANK THE RSL FOR THEIR INVITATION TO SPEAK AT THE

OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE 77TH NATIONAL CONGRESS. I EXTEND TO YOU

GREETINGS OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, DR JOHN HEWSON, AND

I WISH YOUR DELIBERATIONS AT THIS CONGRESS EVERY SUCCESS, AS I

WISH THE LEAGUE EVERY SUCCESS AS IT CONTINUES IN ITS VITAL WORK.
