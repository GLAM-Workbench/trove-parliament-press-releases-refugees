Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for Stirling ABC News Radio Interview with Steve Chase December 20, 2012

Topics: Customs corruption allegations

Steve Chase

Michael Keenan is with us now on the line, good morning to you.

Michael Keenan

Good morning Steve.

Steve Chase

Now you have had some time to digest what Jason Clare has announced this morning. There is this reform board and a lot of other  things as well. Do you think that this is the right response?

Michael Keenan

I think it is a step in the right direction but I think moving on to what we are going to do in the future neglects the most important issue  coming out of today which is how did we possibly get to this situation in the first place. It really is virtually unheard of for systemic  corruption to take hold within a federal government agency and that is what happened here. Before we move on to things that we are  going to do , which of course will be very important, we need to work out why it is that this has been allowed to occur.

Steve Chase

So what are you talking about here? That more may need to be done up and beyond what the Minister has announced?

Michael Keenan

I think we need to look at what has been announced and we need to do everything we can to stop this from occurring again. But what I  am interested in is how it has been allowed to occur and fester in this way. I think a lot of the answer lies in the fact that when the  Labor Party came to office they have systematically taken a knife to Customs at every available opportunity and therefore Customs is  an agency with a lot less people and a lot less resourcing to do its job at the same time that it is dealing with the very significant border  protection crisis that’s been created by illegal boat arrivals. It is an agency that is under enormous pressure and as a result of these  pressures there have been vulnerabilities that have been exposed that organised criminals have taken advantage of.

Steve Chase

What mechanism do you propose to use to, as you argue, to hold the Government accountable as to why we have got to this stage?  Would it be through a parliamentary inquiry or through a wider investigation?

Michael Keenan

I would certainly like to see the Government answer those questions first. It is up to them to explain how on their watch this has been  allowed to occur. I have heard the calls for a judicial inquiry but let’s wait and see what the Government has to say about how we got  to this point in the first place.

Steve Chase

Couldn’t it partly be explained by what the Minister said this morning that a two year investigation is going on and they have actually  been on the case? He indicated at his news conference, Jason  Clare that he was aware of this when he first took over this portfolio?

Michael Keenan

But I think that raises a lot of questions as well. Yes the Government has been aware of this so yes they have been able to make  announcements about what they are going to do in the future today but they haven’t given a full account about why this has occurred  in the first place. This is a very significant revelation today. The idea that organised crime can infiltrate the federal government I think  is quite shocking to most Australians and it is certainly shocking to me. We need to understand why that has happened and I think the  reluctance of the Labor Party to address that issue is the fact that the savage cuts they have inflicted on Customs is one of those  contributing factors.

Steve Chase

We know what you don’t like so let’s go through whether you like the reform board proposal; do you give that the tick?

Michael Keenan

I am happy to support all of the announcements. I think any measures that we can take to improve the integrity of Customs will be very  important but as I said I think that is putting the cart before the horse in terms of what we need to address today and that is why we  are here in the first place.

Steve Chase

You may also be aware of the case of Alan Kessing, he was the former customs officer, he was convicted back in 2004 of leaking a  report on airport security flaws. Nick Xenophon in particular is concerned that he punished rather than patted on the back for doing  what he did. What view do you take on Alan Kessing?

Michael Keenan

It is a very complicated matter and I can’t make a judgement about it as the Opposition spokesmen so what we have always said is  given the opportunity to govern that we would refer that matter to the agency that is responsible for oversight of Customs which is the  Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and I think it is appropriate that they look at that matter and then give us their  findings about how they think Mr Kessing was treated.

Steve Chase

Michael Keenan we will leave it there. I appreciate the Opposition’s view.

Michael Keenan

Nice to talk to you Steve.
