PRIME MINISTER

THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP





**CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY**



30 June 2016

Address to the National Press Club  Canberra





Now comes the time when the conversation and the contest draws to an end and all of us hand over to  the Australian people for them to have their say about the next three years.

And theirs is the opinion that really matters.

These past eight weeks have reinforced for me that the Australian people, now more than ever, are  focused overwhelmingly on the economic realities facing our nation.

One strong sentiment I have picked up from my visits to so many electorates right across the country is  this: Australians want the government they elect to get on with the job of ensuring we have a strong  economy that can set us up for the future; in uncertain times globally, they are looking for a greater  sense of common purpose.

I believe they want our Parliament to offload the ideology, to end the juvenile theatrics and gotcha  moments, to drop the personality politics.

They want our focus to be on issues that matter to them - and an end to division for division’s sake.

Australians are entitled to expect that of their Parliament.

In these uncertain times, we need to stick together, stick to our economic plan, grow our economy,  create more jobs, and build a better future for all Australians.

If re-elected on Saturday, that is what I am committed to delivering.

At this election, my Coalition team is presenting a clear economic plan to secure Australia’s future.

From day one, if re-elected, we will be working harder than ever to deliver our national economic plan, -  Ã¯ÂÂ§ Driving investment, jobs and growth  Ã¯ÂÂ§ Firing up our hi-tech innovation sector  Ã¯ÂÂ§ Ensuring our defence investment is spent here in Australia  Ã¯ÂÂ§ Investing in our advanced manufacturing

Ã¯ÂÂ§ Opening up thousands more export opportunities for farmers, tourism operators and  service industries in the giant markets of Asia  Ã¯ÂÂ§ Providing tax incentives for tens of thousands of small family enterprises to grow, to  innovate, to invest, and to employ more Australians  Ã¯ÂÂ§ and ensuring the federal Budget is managed responsibly and prudently so we can guarantee

funding well into the future for hospitals, schools, Medicare, roads and other vital services  and infrastructure

From day one, the Coalition will be seeking passage of legislation to deliver middle income tax cuts to  over 2.5 million Australian taxpayers and enterprise tax cuts to 870,000 incorporated small businesses  with turnovers below $10 million.

Those businesses currently employ 3.44 million Australians, and our tax cuts will encourage them to  grow, providing more jobs for Australians.

From day one, if re-elected, the Coalition will be presenting legislation to amend the Fair Work Act so we  can stop the takeover of the Country Fire Authority in Victoria - protecting 60,000 volunteer firefighters  from a power grab orchestrated by the United Firefighters’ Union and the Andrews Labor Government  in Victoria.

And we will convene a joint sitting to approve the two vital economic reforms that were double  dissolution triggers for this election - the reinstatement of the Australian Building and Construction  Commission to restore the rule of law to our construction sector; and the Registered Organisations Bill  to hold union officials and employers organisations accountable to the same standards of probity and  transparency as company directors.

From day one, my Coalition team will be doing everything in our power to safeguard Australians and  Australian business from the risk of any external shock flowing from Britain’s vote to withdraw from the  European Union.

The aftermath of the Brexit vote is only one of a range of factors driving uncertainty and apprehension  in a fragile global economy. It is the duty of the Australian Government to keep this volatility on global  markets under close and constant scrutiny - we have to be swift and sure-footed to pre-empt any  negative effects that could affect investment, growth and jobs here at home.

I have taken action this week to ensure the new government, whomever is elected, will have the best  informed analysis and advice from our Council of Financial Regulators - the Reserve Bank, the Treasury,  APRA and ASIC - on any measures we may need to take to limit any impact on our economic interests.

If re-elected I will meet at the earliest opportunity with the New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, so  we can work closely together as we navigate our respective trade negotiations with Europe and Britain.

Australians expect strong and decisive economic leadership at this time. They expect political leaders to  have the experience to manage the risks sensibly and shrewdly, frame a plan of action, and get it done.

This is vital to confidence - and confidence is the key to economic security.

I believe Australians share my excitement in the great opportunities ahead:

Ã¯ÂÂ§ From the farmers, winegrowers and orchardists of Tasmania now selling their clean, green  produce into major world markets - like Josef Chromy, a local winemaker in the Tamar  Valley who, thanks to our export trade deals, is now able to access new customers across  Asia, Europe and North American markets; or Grove Juice in Brisbane which, thanks to our

Japan Free Trade Agreement, is now able to produce an additional 70 thousand bottles of  Fresh Australian Orange Juice.

Ã¯ÂÂ§ To those advanced designers and manufacturers across the country that are making the  most of our defence industry investment, such as Daronmont in Adelaide, Quickstep in  Geelong or Austal in Western Australia (which is Australia’s largest defence exporter).

Ã¯ÂÂ§ To the small businesses like Omni Tanker in Western Sydney and Daisy’s Garden Supply in  Victoria - that because of our enterprise tax cuts will be in a position to invest in and expand  their businesses and hire more staff.

Ã¯ÂÂ§ To IT entrepreneurs, like Wayne Gerard, co-founder of Red Eye Apps in Brisbane, at the  frontier of the digital economy or businesses reinventing themselves like Carbon Revolution  in Geelong who are bringing to life our National Innovation and Science Agenda.

Australia has done well to record 3.1 per cent growth in the year to March - better than any of the G7  economies, and well above the OECD average.

But that in itself reminds us we are in a low-growth global economy, and that we need to keep a  weather eye on the significant headwinds.

Given that uncertainty, my strong sense is that what Australians are looking for most from this election  is a step up in political culture - strong, decisive, resolute leadership, yet with a focus on what unites  rather than divides.

That is the leadership my team and I offer to the Australian people.

During the campaign, you have heard me emphasise the critical importance of Australians electing a  strong Coalition majority government.

Open markets, globalisation, and the speed of technological advancement is changing our world at a  scale and pace unprecedented in human experience.

In this dynamic global economy, our opportunities as Australians have never been greater or the  horizons wider.

But to succeed in the 21st century is not a given: we as Australians have to make the transition to an  economy that is more diverse, more innovative, smarter, more productive - an economy that wins, and  keeps on winning.

Australia’s 24 million people are our greatest asset.

The talent, ingenuity and enterprise of hard-working Australians has delivered this nation a remarkable  run of success.

For that success story to continue in the decades ahead, we as Australians have important choices to  make.

That is why I am asking my fellow Australians at this election to support our Coalition’s National  Economic Plan for a Strong New Economy.

A stronger economy provides the jobs and growth that allows people to plan their lives with greater  confidence and certainty.

It provides the economic benefits to pay the mortgage, to buy the car, to put the kids through school, to  pay for the holiday.

A stronger economy guarantees funding for vital social services.

Economic security is a concept known to every family mapping out the household budget; by every mum  or dad worried about the next pay cheque, the next job.

The economy does not rule our lives; but the assurance of a strong economy helps underpin that  fundamental confidence in our future.

Under our national economic plan, every lever of policy is directed at ensuring a stronger economy that  can deliver more jobs, more investment, and create better opportunities for Australians to realise their  dreams.

My vision is to set Australia up for decades to come as a high-wage, first world economy of the 21st  century, with a generous social welfare safety net.

This means a thriving business sector, where small family enterprises are encouraged to think big. Our  enterprise tax plan will do just that.

This means an Australia competing with the world’s best in the hi-tech industries and jobs of the future.

I want to see our farmers and services industries flourishing like never before, with millions of new  customers in the markets of Asia to our north, where half of the world’s middle class will soon reside.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of small businesses now exporting  increased by 12.9 per cent in the last financial year alone.

They are taking advantage of our export trade deals with China, Korea, Japan and Singapore, which  provide premium access for Australian business to the leading economies in our part of the world.

And it will only be disciplined financial management and a strong economy that can deliver the growth  in revenues to guarantee funding for health and education, and all the other services Australians want  and expect from government.

If you want a strong Medicare, well-funded schools and world-class roads and infrastructure, you need a  strong economy to pay for it.

Our Plan will give Australian families economic security in an uncertain world.

Our opponents at this election cannot offer that reassurance to Australians - they do not have an  economic plan for jobs and growth.

Labor’s one and only strategy is to tiptoe back into government in a chaotic alliance with Greens, minor  parties and independents.

In an uncertain world, Labor offers only greater uncertainty.

Labor has nothing to say about jobs, growth and our economic future.

Instead, Labor talks about higher taxes, more spending, higher deficits, more debt.

Labor have been making commitments they cannot pay for, and cannot deliver.

That explains the shambles around their Budget costings. Over this campaign, it has been a sorry tale of  Labor budget backflips, and policy reversals.

The first backflip was on foreign aid, when previously they had said our policy approach was one they  “certainly wouldn’t continue with”.

Then they back flipped on the $4.5 billion School Kids Bonus, which they had previously said was “a  demonstration of Labor's commitment to education.”

Then there’s the changes to the pension asset test - another Labor backflip.

These were the same changes that Bill Shorten only opposed very recently in his book, saying that  “when Labor formulates retirement policy...we look beyond the headlines and cheap politics.”

Then, in the shadows of the Coalition campaign rally, and away from the critical eye of the Canberra  press gallery, Labor finally unveiled their Budget costings.

In that document, Labor not only revealed that they have no plan for jobs and growth. They  acknowledged that their ‘fiscal strategy’ is to drag the Budget further into red ink by $16.5 billion over  the next four years.

Ã¯ÂÂ§ In fact, Labor’s Budget bottom line will be worse than the Coalition over the next seven  years.  Ã¯ÂÂ§ Put another way, by the election in 2022, Labor would still not have enough savings to pay  for the promises they have made in this election.

Labor would be borrowing over $11 million more than the Government each and every day over the  next four years.

Their budget bottom line over the medium term relies on over $100 billion in additional taxes, with tax  revenue approaching 26 per cent of GDP - this would take Labor to the highest tax-to-GDP ratio in this  country since at least 1970.

And Labor’s fiscal strategy is predicated on no further tax relief for a decade or more. By 2027, under  this scenario, an additional 750,000 Australians will be paying the top marginal tax rate of 49 per cent - a  $19 billion tax grab guaranteed to stifle work incentives.

Hard-working Australians should be appalled.

And the closer you look, the more destructive it becomes.

Ã¯ÂÂ§ A negative gearing and capital gains tax policy which aims to hit Australians with $37 billion  worth of tax increases - one of the largest tax increases in recent history. Yet Labor refuses to  reveal what impact it believes this tax hike will have on housing prices, rents, investment,  housing supply, confidence, or the wider economy.

Ã¯ÂÂ§ A superannuation policy which banks all of the revenue that the Government’s policies will raise  - but which - incredibly - adopts none of the Government’s policies. The refusal by Labor to  identify the policy measures to support these savings defies all the rules and rigour of public  finance. For all we know, Labor could adopt the Greens’ superannuation policies.  Sixteen

million Australians planning for retirement are left with not a clue about how Labor would  change the superannuation system.  How is this acceptable?

Ã¯ÂÂ§ A hospitals policy which provides an additional $2bn over 11 years - when Labor has for the last  two years been promising an additional $57 billion spending. Labor has failed to fund over 96  per cent of the so-called hospital “cuts” they solemnly swore they would restore. What a hoax.

Ã¯ÂÂ§ A childcare policy that increases funding over the first two years and then cuts it over the next  two.

In contrast, my Coalition team takes a methodical approach to Budget Repair. Living within our means is  fundamental to the Coalition’s national economic plan.

For every new dollar we want to spend we make sure we find another at least another dollar through  savings elsewhere in the Budget.

My Treasurer, Scott Morrison, brought down our Budget on May 3 which showed net improvements to  the budget of $1.7 billion.

We began submitting campaign costings on 17 June. They are publicly available for all to examine and  question.

The end result of our announcements over the campaign is an improvement in the Budget bottom line  each and every year, totalling $1.1 billion.

In the Budget we announced the most comprehensive changes to the taxation of superannuation in a  decade.

Not all of these policies have been popular, but they make the system fairer and more flexible.

We had the courage to put them in the Budget and take them to an election.

We will not be making any further changes to superannuation in the next term of Government. Mr  Shorten cannot match that claim.

Superannuation goes to the heart of economic security.

Mr Shorten is now a policy vacuum on this vital issue, playing political games with the retirement plans  of millions of Australians.

Like his Budget black hole, this demonstrates no economic leadership.

Labor’s recklessness is completely ill-suited to the demands of the times.

They are in complete denial about the state of the Budget, and the risks in the global economy.

As leading economists have confirmed, if elected, Labor’s fiscal profligacy and ill-discipline could put  Australia’s AAA credit rating at risk.

Bill Shorten has no economic plan to deal with the challenges of securing Australia’s economic future in  the 21st century.

His priority at this election is purely political.

As he says himself, he wants to run the country like a trade union.

How else to explain his incredibly ideological war on business.

How else to explain his dishonest campaign to frighten frail and elderly people into thinking their health  services are at risk.

Medicare is guaranteed under the Coalition, and Bill Shorten knows it.

He has been mocked in this very room for spreading these falsehoods.

He diminishes only himself, but he persists in the hope that he can deceive enough Australians to think  that government services never at risk are under threat.

Australians are well and truly over this tactic of setting out deliberately and dishonestly to fuel fear and  division.

The only long-term threat to our universal health care system is the risk of governments adopting tax  and spend policies that stifle economic growth, damage business confidence, discourage investment and  employment.

Only a stronger economy can deliver the growth in revenues we need to pay in the longer term for the  services we want.

And only the Coalition has a plan to drive that growth.

Only the Coalition has a plan to support investment and create jobs.

Only the Coalition’s spending commitments are fully funded, with a sustainable path to surplus.

Only the Coalition will protect our borders and keep Australians safe.

And only the Coalition can form strong, stable majority government.

It is worth remembering that Australia has not had a strong majority government returned to office at  an election going back to 2007.

And that is why this election is a critical choice for Australians.

Leave it to independents and preferences to decide, and Australians will find themselves this time next  week with no clarity about their future.

It is a roll of the dice that could well result in Bill Shorten as Prime Minister, with unions, Greens and  independents pulling the strings.

This threat is real. So when it comes to the minor parties - be they Lambie, Xenophon, Lazarus or Hanson  - Australians need to consider very carefully the impact on practical policy outcomes, and the  workability of the Parliament.

I say to Australians, again….if you only really know the leader of a minor party, but you don’t really know  their candidates, and you don’t really know their policies, don’t vote for them.

Australians won’t want to end up next week with a result they didn’t see coming…so I say, again:

A vote for Labor, Greens or an Independent in one of the 20 key battleground seats across the country,  is, in effect, a vote for the chaos of a hung Parliament; a budget black hole; big Labor taxes; less jobs;  more boats.

We can have the sort of chaotic government we see in today’s Queensland, with a minority Labor  government trapped in policy paralysis.

Or there is the alternative model of a stable, confident administration under Premier Mike Baird in NSW,  where a strong economy and strong Budget position is funding new roads and rail and better health and  education services.

That is why I am urging Australians to vote for a local Liberal or National instead, and to return a stable  Coalition majority Government so we can stick to a plan that is delivering jobs and growth, and securing  our economic future.

Obviously, there is not the time here to name them all, but can I mention just two local candidates who  exemplify the dedication and energy we ask of our elected representatives.

Ned Mannoun, in the south-west Sydney seat of Werriwa, and Julia Banks, our candidate for the seat of  Chisholm, in Melbourne’s east, have both campaigned so well they are in with a chance of claiming two  long-held Labor electorates.

Both are part of our great story as an immigrant nation. Both come with direct practical experience in  business. And both bring real passion and commitment to the communities they serve.

So, today, I respectfully urge the voters in Werriwa and Chisholm to send these two outstanding  Australians individuals to our Parliament.

My Coalition team is determined that we show strong economic leadership, and bring all our experience  to the task of building a strong new economy.

Our role as leaders is to address the real priorities in people’s lives - secure incomes, sustainable health  and education systems, a safe society, and more and better jobs for themselves and their children.

Every element of our Coalition economic plan is directed at delivering the stronger economy so vital for  Australians to achieve these aspirations.

Together, Australians have the talents and capacity to make the successful transition to a stronger new  economy. Together, as a nation, we have the resilience and resourcefulness to get the job done.

And I believe Australians, overwhelmingly, would think it is not before time that our Parliament began to  work with greater unity of purpose towards that goal.

Get the next three years right - stick together, and stick to our economic plan - and we can all look  forward with confidence and optimism to an Australia where our very best years are still ahead of us.

Ends
