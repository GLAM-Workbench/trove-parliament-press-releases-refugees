THE MIDDLE EAST IN W ORLD POLITICS

Mr Ch a ir m a n , La d i e s  and Ge n t l e m e n ,

I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING

HERE TONIGHT TO OPEN THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE

Au s t r a l ia n  I n s t i t u t e  of I n t e r n a t io n a l  Af f a i r s  on " T he Mid d l e

CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC DEBATE

ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, It IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY IN

TERMS OF THE PUBLIC ITSELF, BUT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE

FOREIGN POLICY PROCESS DOES NOT BECOME A CLOSED SYSTEM AND

THAT IT RECEIVES INPUTS FROM AN INFORMED AND ATTENTIVE

p u b l i c . Po l i t i c i a n s  and Government  o f f i c i a l s  can b e n e f i t

GREATLY FROM INFORMED, THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION OF ISSUES OF

CURRENT IMPORTANCE, AND OCCASIONS SUCH AS THIS PROVIDE AN

EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO RE-EXAMINE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AND

TO CONSIDER PROBLEMS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES,

In, THIS CONNECTION, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS

OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING HOW MUCH VALUE I ATTACH TO THE ROLE

PLAYED BY THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

IN PROMOTING INFORMED DEBATE ON FOREIGN POLICY WITHIN THE

FUNDAMENTAL CURRENT IMPORTANCE -  ONE WHICH IS BOTH COMPLEX

AND DIVERSE, AS THE LIS T OF TOPICS ON WHICH PAPERS ARE

TO BE GIVEN INDICATES. THE SUBJECT MATTER IS NOT ONE WHICH

I PROPOSE TO TRAVERSE IN D E T A IL , BUT IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO

YOU IF I WERE TO GIVE YOU A BROAD AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE

ON THE PLACE OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN WORLD POLITICS.

The Mi d d l e Ea s t has a l w a y s been of major im p o r t a n c e

to the We s t. It has been  an area  c en tr al  to world  order

AND STABILITY. I n THE POST-WORLD WAR II PERIOD, THE

ArA B - I sRAELI CONFLICT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ACUTE AND -

GIVEN THE PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS EXISTING BETWEEN THE

ANTAGONISTS AND GREAT POWERS -  ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS -

IN WORLD POLITICS.

I n  the las t  decade  the c h a n g in g  r e l a t i o n s h i p  between

OIL SUPPLY AND WORLD ENERGY REQUIREMENTS HAS GREATLY ENHANCED

THE STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE REGION, ÃÂªÃÂÃÂ

IMPORTANCE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WAS BROUGHT HOME BY THE OIL

EMBARGO OF 1973, AND EVER SINCE THEN THE WEST HAS WATCHED

THE ECONOMIC BAROMETER OF OIL SUPPLIES AND OIL PRICES WITH

concern . Events  d u r in g  the l a s t  year  have done no thing  to

EASE THAT CONCERN.

There have also  been  other  developments  which  a f f e c t

Western  in t e r e s t s  in the Mid d l e  East -  a l l  of which  have the

POTENTIAL IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD TO PUT THE SECURITY

of Western  energy  s u p p l i e s , and in d e e d  world  peace  at r i s k .

These developments  in c l u d e  d is a g r e e m e n t  by most Arab St a t e s

w it h  the Camp Da v i d  approach  to Mid d l e  East p eac e , the

I r a n ia n  Re v o lu tio n  and i t s  a f t e r m a t h , and the So v ie t  in v a s io n

of Af g h a n i s t a n .

Af g h an istan  and the Mid d l e  East ' -

Although  Af g h a n is t a n  perhaps  f a l l s  o u t s id e  the broadly

ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF THE MIDDLE EAST, THE SOVIET INVASION OF

THAT COUNTRY CLEARLY AFFECTS THE WHOLE REGION AND POTENTIALLY

THREATENS VITAL WESTERN STRATEGIC AND ENERGY INTERESTS.

Th i s  act of aggression  therefore  has r a m i f i c a t i o n s  for the

ENTIRE WESTERN WORLD AND IS AN EVENT WHICH WILL HAVE A CLOSE

BEARING ON SUPERPOWER POLITICS FOR SOME TIME TO COME.

I t would  be unwise  also  to u n d e r e s t im a t e  the

MANIFESTED IN RELATIONS BETWEEN SYRIA AND IRAQ; BETWEEN

I s la m i s a l s o i n c r e a s i n g l y  c i t e d  as a fact or for

CONTAINS THE POTENTIAL FOR REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN THOSE

EXCEEDED THAT OF OTHER PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCES, REFLECTING

INTER A L IA , O I L 'S  PRICE COMPETITIVENESS, TRANSPORTABILITY

AND HIGH CALORIFIC VALUE, As THE DEMAND FOR OIL HAS

INCREASED, SO HAS THE DEPENDENCE OF THE INDUSTRIALISED

COUNTRIES ON IMPORTED O IL . FOR EXAMPLE, THE UNITED STATES,

ONCE THE WORLD'S LEADING PRODUCER AND EXPORTER, NOW IMPORTS

407o of i t s  n e e d s ; the FRG, France  and Japan  are of course

VERY MUCH MORE DEPENDENT. IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS ALSO

IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SOVIET UNION'S OIL PRODUCTION

IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE, PERHAPS SERIOUSLY, IN THE 1980s

AND THAT IT IS LIKELY TO BECOME AN OIL IMPORTER.
