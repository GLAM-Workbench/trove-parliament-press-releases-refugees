Outcomes of the 2019-20 Migration Program

The Government has published the detailed outcomes from the 2019-20 Migration  Program.

The permanent migration intake was 140,366 in 2019-20.

Seventy per cent of the visas were granted through the skilled stream (95,843 in total),  including 4,109 places under the highly skilled Global Talent - Independent program,  launched in November 2019.

There were 23,372 regional visas delivered, from the 25,000 places allocated. This compares  to 18,308 regional visas granted in 2018-19 - an increase of 27 per cent.

There were 41,961 visas granted in the Family program, including 37,118 Partner visas.

Two-thirds of permanent visas were granted to individuals already in Australia who  transitioned from a temporary visa to permanent residency.

There were also 13,171 visas granted in the Humanitarian Program in 2019-20, including  4,765 visas (45 per cent) for those who were referred for settlement in regional areas.

The size and composition of the 2020-21 Migration and Humanitarian programs will be  considered in light of the developing COVID-19 situation and announced as part of the  Budget process in October.

Further information on Australiaâ€™s 2019-20 Permanent Migration Program and  Humanitarian Program is available on the Department of Home Affairs website.
