TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  ST ANNE'S NURSING HOME, HUNTER'S HILL

Topics: John Fahey pre-selection, Rupert Murdoch comments

E & O E :  ........ .................................................................................

Howard:

Well ladies and gentlemen, I'd just like to repeat what I said on Friday night and that is I am  personally delighted and the Liberal Party's campaign prospects are greatly enhanced by the fact  that the Party has endorsed John Fahey as its candidate for the federal seat of Macarthur in the  upcoming federal election. John, o f course, has an enormous personal following in that  electorate and he also, o f course, is a figure o f great stature in public life in Australia. He will  be a very powerful addition to the Liberal Party campaign team in the coming election and

As we all know from observing past state and federal elections, winning power is very much  about accumulating the right number o f seats. It's not enough to win the majority o f the vote.  You've got to win the majority o f seats and that means parties have to give very careful attention  to having the right candidates in the right place.

Now I can't think of a better candidate in a better place in the forthcoming federal election than  John Fahey in Macarthur so I'm delighted to have him as part o f my campaign team. I think  he'll make a very strong contribution in the campaign and after winning the seat he'll be a very  valuable member of the federal Parliamentary Party.

Journalist:

M r Howard would you like to see Mr Fahey as a Minister in a Howard government?

Howard:

I'm not going to speculate about personnel but Mr Fahey's got an enormous amount to  contribute and an enormous amount to offer but I don't, for reasons you will understand, get into  the business o f speculating about personnel in the Ministry.

Howard:

I think I'll have a lot o f talented people but he brings particular skills.

Journalist:

Mr Howard, this morning Rupert Murdoch (inaudible)

Howard:

Well I watched the interview and I welcome the fact that Mr Murdoch said that he wasn't on any  horse. I think that's good. All I want and all the Liberal Party wants is a fair, straight down the  line crack o f the whip from the media. If we get that, it's up to us to convince the electorate to  put us in.

Journalist:

(inaudible)

Howard:

I havenâ€™t spoken to Mr Murdoch since he was in Australia the last time but I may speak to him  before he goes, I don't know. I speak to him occasionally, as I do Mr Packer and to the  emissaries o f Conrad Black and indeed Mr O'Reilly and you do to anybody else who wants to  have a yam. They're all important but at the end o f the day it's the voters that will decide and

providing the media plays it down the line, down the middle, down the centre, I'll be well  (inaudible)

Journalist:

(inaudible)

Howard:

I think what I'm doing at the moment is absolutely correct.

Journalist:

Howard:

Well we're going to have a look at the implications o f that over the next few days because we're  interested in as much competition as possible in that area. We're also realistic enough to accept  that to a country the size o f Australia there is a limit to how much competition you can have  simply because it's a relatively small market. But we'll look at that. Competition in the public  interest is the guiding principle rather than anything else.

Journalist:

So you really (inaudible)

Fahey:

It's been a very difficult time in the last few weeks. There are a number o f options that were  there but I indicated some time ago that the community that I'd represented in my political  career which effectively has been the federal seat o f Macarthur, if an opportunity were there, I'd

give it serious thought. To John Howard's credit, hopefully I will never regret that I said that,  (inaudible) made that opportunity for me and (inaudible) to join his team and I say that because  I believe John Howard will deliver on anything that he says and I'm angry, and have been ever  since the State election, when I look at Labor and see they won government through lies and  deceit, tollways etcetera. I look back at the last federal election and say, we can argue what we  like but the simple fact was many people (inaudible) the L-A-W law on tax cuts, again Labor in  Canberra, the Prime Minister lied to the people. Now I'm joining an honest person who will  deliver. I believe I've always had a further contribution to make. I regret that I lost the election.  Naturally everyone would regret doing such a thing. There is now a chance to represent the  community that I've always represented and to be part o f John Howard's team. I'm pretty  excited about it.

Journalist:

Are you confident o f winning Macarthur?

Fahey:

I'm quietly confident. I accept the fact that it's currently held by Labor. I have one ambition at  this point in time, one challenge, and that is to win the seat o f Macarthur, to assist John Howard  winning government. I will give it everything and can I just say that will be a fair effort on my

part.

Journalist:

(inaudible) federal Liberals should be tougher on unions ....

4.

Fahey:

No, you wrote that I said that. I'll tell you exactly what I said and I hope you can follow me.  I've said that I have believed for a considerable time that Australia needed one system o f  industrial relations. I asked John Howard, I pleaded to John Howard to work towards that. It is  farcical that we have seven systems o f industrial relations in a country the size o f Australia. It

took us eighty-nine years to get a national company's code and I would like to think that we  could have one system o f industrial relations as I said in my second reading speech on the very  good legislation in New South Wales back in 1991. I believe that was a pretty good blueprint  for a national.(inaudible) Rest assured that it is still a wish that I have. I've had it for several  years and I asked John Howard to be tough on that and if Mr Keating does certain things like  Mabo and competition policy, coming in and (inaudible) over the top o f the States, I don't mind  if the new Prime Minister, John Howard, (inaudible)

Journalist:

You wanted John Howard to be (inaudible) that's pretty unambiguous.

Fahey:

(inaudible) in the context o f the power that a Prime Minister has to get something that's good for  the country and I can say to you that any industrial relations (inaudible) has a legitimate role for  unions, (inaudible)

Journalist:

Are you taking much drop in pay going to Canberra?

Fahey:

I don't know, I've never really looked at that, (inaudible) drop in pay in the context that in the  last few weeks there are some pretty exciting and financially rewarding options that would have  come together early next year and I'm turning my back on that. Maybe I don't like the idea o f  having my weekends (inaudible) like you journalists.

Journalist:

(inaudible) Liberal candidate to replace you in Southern Highlands?

Fahey:

Look the Party decided on Friday night they'd go through the usual pre-selection timetable. I  can say that there are two or three interesting people, pretty exciting and very competent people  who are prepared to come forward at this stage and nominate were the pre-selection. Whoever  it might be that is the Liberal candidate, I think we're going to be well served in Southern

Highlands. I might say that it gives me a great deal o f peace o f mind (inaudible)

5.

Journalist:

Mr Howard (inaudible)

Howard:

Hang on, we'd better have a Laurie break - a passing Laurie

(aircraft noise)

Journalist:

(inaudible)

Howard:

I can assure you that whatever platform we are elected on will be implemented. I've said all  along that changing the industrial relations system to make it more flexible to give employers  and employees a lot more choice has been a key goal o f mine for a long time and one o f the  great advantages o f the sort o f industrial relations system I advocate and John Fahey advocates  is that it gives Australian workers the hope o f higher wages based on higher productivity and it  has to be said again and again, that under the system that Mr Keating champions, the real wages  o f Australian workers have gone down. Over the last thirteen years, not only have their wages  gone down but their average mortgage bills have gone up by 50 per cent and yet he parades  himself still as the champion o f the Australian working men and women. His system has  delivered real wage reductions. Our system holds out the hope o f higher wages based on higher  productivity because it will be a more free-flowing and more flexible and more workplace based  system. It stands to reason that a system based on bringing forward the best capacities o f  owners and employees at the workplace level over time will deliver real wage increases.

Journalist:

You also want lower taxes (inaudible)

Howard:

Well I'm not going to make campaign promises on the run. I will have something to say about  taxation at an appropriate time. The time for the alternative Prime Minister o f this country to  announce policies on taxation is not at a doorstop in response to what a media proprietor has  said. The Australian people deserve a rather more orderly electoral process than that and I will,

at a time o f my choosing, in a way that the Australian people will understand, will have  something to say about the subject o f taxation, but I'm not going to trivialise this election  campaign by giving running responses to what media proprietors, no matter who they may be,  have said on television programmes.

Thank you.  ends
