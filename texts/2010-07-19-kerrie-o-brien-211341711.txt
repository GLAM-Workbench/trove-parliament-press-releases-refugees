KERRY O’BRIEN:  And the Prime Minister joins me now. First of all, only one  debate?

PM:  Well we have obviously left these arrangements to our party secretaries, to  Karl Bitar from the Labor Party, but Kerry I’ve debated Tony Abbott a fair bit in  past. We’ve routinely debated each other on TV and other places.

O’BRIEN:  Well Kevin Rudd was prepared to consider at least three debates.

PM:  Well the party secretaries are working on this and, as I understand it, the  debate is likely to be Sunday night but I’ve debated Tony Abbott a lot of times.

O’BRIEN:  Yes, but not in an election campaign where you were Prime Minister  and he was aspiring to it.  Is it good or bad news for you that this will be up  against probably one of the biggest rating nights in a long time?

PM:  I can understand the fascination with cooking and eating.  So I know many  Australians will watch that show but I think Australians will still pay some regard  to the debate and to the election campaign and what’s said in it.

O’BRIEN:  I know that political parties, modern political parties, feel naked  without their slogans but don’t you think Australians deserve better in this  campaign than party generated slogans and clichÃÂ©s like ‘moving forward’ and  ‘hard working Australians’ and whatever else Labor pollsters come up with from

the previous night’s polling?  Is that what political leadership really should be  about?

PM:  I’ve been using those words because they mean something to me and I  think they mean something to the nation.  I’ve used the term ‘moving forward’  because I believe it captures a spirit about Australia. We are a confident  optimistic, forward-looking people at our best and I think millions of Australians

in their own lives have got a story about how they move forward, how they  seized opportunity and I want to be talking to the Australian people in this  campaign about how our nation can seize the opportunities of the future.

O’BRIEN:  You’re really talking about that, or are you talking about moving  forward from Kevin Rudd?

PM:  Well, I’m talking about that, I’m talking about that confident, optimistic  outlook.  I absolutely believe Kerry, with every fibre of my being, that the best  days of this nation are in front of it and not behind it.  I think we are often  invited to feel afraid of the future.  I don’t think we should feel afraid, I don’t  think there’s any challenge too tough or too big that we can’t overcome it if we

work together.  That’s why I’m talking about moving forward and I’m talking  about policies that will make a difference for our future.

O’BRIEN:  But is it really necessary to be so full of repetition though?  Paul  Keating‘s speech writer Don Watson says, ‘the way you’re already endlessly  repeating slogans in treating voters like imbeciles, trying to train them like  dogs’.  It happened under Howard, it happened under Rudd.  Don’t you want to

be a leader that tries to break the mould, that isn’t just seen like every other  leader in the relevantly recent past as trying to manipulate voters with spin?

PM:  Kerry I am who I am and I’m going to talk about the things that I believe I  bring to this job.  And I believe I bring to this job a sense of confidence and  optimism about this nation’s future and I’m not going be dissuaded from talking  about that. I also think....



O’BRIEN:  Look it’s not about being dissuaded from talking about real things but  you know exactly what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the cynicism, the  disillusionment, the frustration that you must confront often in the electorate, in  your own personal electorate, in the wider electorate. I hear it all the time, so do

many others.  You know exactly what I’m talking about.  People are fed up with  what they perceive as spin and superficial attempts at manipulation.

PM:  Kerry I think you are drawing in some ways, a little bit of a false divide  here.  I believe I can be talking about the opportunities of this nation’s future  and talking about real things.  I mean talking about sustainability for this  country is a real thing.  Talking about giving every child a chance at a great  quality education is a real thing and having come from the position as Education

Minister, it is a very concrete thing about National Curriculum and better  teaching and My School and transparency, and trades training centres, getting  the opportunity to get an apprenticeship. They’re real things....

O’BRIEN:   When you talk about better teachers, can you nominate any clear,  existing example of where you can say that your policies have led to better  teaching?  Can you point to teacher trainees now coming out three years into  your Government?  Teacher trainees coming out having been given better

training? Can you point to where there is a better quality of teaching in any  Australian school as a result of your time as Prime Minister?   Can you point to  smaller classes?

PM:  Kerry I certainly can.  I can point you to our new program, Teach for  Australia, which already has some of our best and brightest graduates teaching  in disadvantaged schools.  People who got first class degrees going through an  accelerated program, teaching in disadvantaged classrooms today.



O’BRIEN:  ..they are already out there teaching?

PM:  Absolutely.  Absolutely, feel free to come and sit in a class with me Kerry.

They’re out there teaching.  Today there are teachers in this State where we’re  sitting now, of NSW, being paid more to go the class rooms that need them the  most because of my reforms as Education Minister.  They’re real things and  Kerry, they are about moving forward, they’re about moving forward to the  promise that I believe this nation owes every Australian child, that no matter the

circumstances of their birth they get a great education.

O’BRIEN:  But in your first two significant policy decisions as Prime Minister, you  actually went backward.  You shrank Labor’s proposed Mining Tax and you took  Labor’s policy on asylum seekers back closer to where it was under John  Howard.  I’m not saying that his policy is better or worse, that it was better or

worse than yours is, what I’m saying is, you went backwards in time to his  policy?  Now doesn’t that make a mockery of your slogan?

PM:  Kerry I’m going to beg to differ on the analysis.  We set out to get the  Australian people a fairer share of the proceeds of this minerals boom and to  make a difference to the future.  I’ve been to great mining places in Australia.   To places like Rockhampton where you see beautiful buildings that are the  proceeds of earlier mining booms.  In that case, Mount Morgan Gold.  We want

to make sure that for the future of this country people will say that they got  something from this mining boom.  We achieved that.

O’BRIEN:  Yeah but what you were primarily doing was defusing a bad and ugly  political situation for Labor and you took the tax that Wayne Swan, still your  Treasurer, and Kevin Rudd had presented and you shrank it back.  Now that’s  going backwards not forwards is it not in terms of revenue to Government?



PM: Kerry I was going forwards by making sure we had certainty for the mining  industry and mining communities.  Uncertainty was costing us.  It was making  mining communities anxious.  It was making the mining industry anxious.  I  wanted to make sure we had arrangements where people knew what was going

to be going on.  We’ve struck a breakthrough agreement with our biggest  miners.  We now have Don Argus, a very famous Australian, leading a process to  work on implementation and because I’ve done that, we’ve got $10.5 billion of  revenue we can use to invest in the future of our economy, cutting company tax,

breaks for small business, infrastructure, and of course national savings in the  form of superannuation and Kerry ...

O’BRIEN:  And using the $10.5 billion, using the calculation of the $10.5 billion,  under the old formula I would assume that would have been about $18 billion.

PM:  We worked of course to get the best information and with that best  information we were able to get different estimates of what the tax would raise.   A few things changed from the original calculations, including better information  becoming available about commodity prices and commodity contracts but ...



O’BRIEN: But that being the case that means that your formula will deliver $8  billion less or $7.5 billion less in revenue than it would have under the old  formula.

PM: Well Kerry I’ve described myself as an optimist and describing myself as an  optimist I’m going to say to you there’s $10.5 billion of extra tax our biggest

miners have agreed to pay.  Mr Abbott says he doesn’t want it.  Doesn’t want  the infrastructure it will pay for, doesn’t want to cut company tax.  I mean  doesn’t it strike you as a little bit odd that the Liberal Party, the Liberal Party, is  going into this election campaign promising increased company taxation and it’s

a Labor Prime Minister that wants to cut company tax because that’s better for  our economy and better for balanced growth.

O’BRIEN:  We’re suddenly hearing a lot from you about your commitment to a  sustainable population in Australian cities.  Is there any evidence on the public  record that you ever had that kind of concern before you became Prime Minister,  or again, is it only because polling has exposed serious public concern about

Kevin Rudd’s big Australia?  In other words, how sincere are you?

PM:  Kerry I live in Melbourne’s west.  My electorate covers two growth  corridors, Wyndham and Melton.  They grow every year.  They grow  spectacularly.  If you don’t get yourself a new street directory every year you’ve  got no idea where you’re going next.  That’s how quickly those suburbs grow. So

as a local Member of Parliament I’ve seen the benefits and the burdens of  growth, the congestion, the pressure on services, and I understand that we can’t  for the future of this country just keep pouring more people into places like  Melbourne’s west or places like Sydney’s west.  I think we can do better,

planning a whole population strategy.  I mean this nation has never had one, a  whole population strategy.  We can do better and protect our quality of life in  doing so.

O’BRIEN:  But when previously have you expressed concern about those things  publicly?

PM:  As a local community representative I would talk to people about these  things all the time. And if I didn’t talk to them Kerry they’d be cantering up to  me in Watton Street, Werribee, and saying ‘what about the fact that it now takes  us so much longer to get over the West Gate Bridge and to get into town?’,  ‘what about the fact we can’t get to see a GP when we ring up as a new family in

the suburb?’, ‘we can’t even get on the books of a GP’.  Those issues have been  with me as a Member of Parliament.  That’s why I’m such a big believer, so  passionate, about making sure we’ve got good quality services for people.

O’BRIEN:  So when Kevin Rudd talked about being very much supportive of a big  Australia did you express your concerns to him?  Did you tell him Kevin, I think  we’ve got to be careful about this?

PM:  Well Kerry, I’m not going to go through confidential conversations of  Cabinet ...

O’BRIEN: You see you always say, you always plead this business of Cabinet  confidentiality.  I’m not asking you for the details.  You know what I’m asking  you.  I’m asking you did you ever express concern in any term, broad or  otherwise, to Kevin Rudd about his enthusiasm for a big Australia?



PM:  Well Kerry you might say politicians plead Cabinet confidentiality but of  course it’s a core of our system of government so I’m not going to go to internal  discussions. But I am concerned Kerry, when we look across this country, I am

concerned about water, how we’re going to have water security in the future for  our population.  I’m concerned about the quality of our soils.  I am concerned  about urban congestion.  But I’m also concerned about those places in the  country that want to grow, need more people, have got jobs, need more skilled

labour.  We want to make a difference for them.

O’BRIEN:  You seem to show inexperience in the way you handled your attempt  to persuade East Timor to embrace a regional refugee centre for asylum  seekers.  How do you persuade Australians that you’re a safe pair of hands on all  those very tricky foreign policy issues that Kevin Rudd knew like the back of his

hand.  You are a novice in that field by comparison aren’t you?

PM:  I’m not going to pretend that I’ve come to this position with a lifetime in  foreign affairs Kerry, I haven’t.  That’s true.  And if you look at some of my  predecessors as Prime Minister, obviously Kevin Rudd had a lifetime of  experience in foreign affairs. John Howard did not and we could go back through

Prime Ministers across the ages

O’BRIEN:  But it has been a Labor tradition hasn’t it that by the time Labor has  produced a Prime Minister, that Prime Minister has already shown his hand,  always been his hand in the past, his hand in that field.  I mean many have  arrived with particular dreams.  Prime Ministers, let’s just go back as far as

Whitlam.  I would suggest to you that every Australian Prime Minister since  Whitlam has put his own stamp on a particular aspect at least of foreign policy.   What is the area of foreign policy that you would nominate is one that you would  like to think will stamp the Gillard Government?



PM:  Well I would like to think that engagement in our region is what would  stamp the Gillard Government.  I mean this is where our future lies.  This is  where we’ve got to make our way in an ever-changing and very competitive,  sometimes cut throat world in terms of economic competition.  We are a great  trading nation.  We can make the most of the opportunities in our region.  Kerry

I have had the opportunity to do a bit as Deputy Prime Minister, travelling to  India for example, travelling to the United States talking to people about not just  portfolio matters but more broadly.  I’m not going to overstate my experience.  I  haven’t been a diplomat or anything like that.  I understand that.  But I believe I

can deal with these issues as Prime Minister.

O’BRIEN:  On the night before he was dumped so ruthlessly Kevin Rudd said  that he’d been elected as Prime Minister by the Australian people, not by Labor’s  faction leaders.  This campaign is all about you versus Tony Abbott, just like the  last one was Rudd versus Howard.  Except now if people do vote you into office

you can’t actually guarantee that you’ll be there for the full term can you?

PM:  Well Kerry, you know, turn it up I suppose.  I mean I’m here as Prime  Minister now because I’ve got the confidence of the Labor Party caucus and in  our Westminster system that’s what makes leaders.  That’s why Tony Abbott is  there presenting as the Liberal leader in this campaign because he defeated Mr

Turnbull by one vote so you know ....

O’BRIEN:  But you know the way elections operate in this country.  It’s almost  presidential these days in the way leaders present themselves, the way the

focus goes on the leaders. Many, many, many Australian voters would believe  that in voting for their Labor candidate they’re voting for Julia Gillard as Prime  Minister.  Because it now seems your party has set a new standard that if a  leader drops in the polls to a point, even in a first term, where there seems

some danger that they could lose, gone.

PM:  Well Kerry I understand that there are Australians who, when they vote,  you know, believe in a system that necessarily focuses on the leaders and  election campaigns do, that they are you know, voting for a particular leader.   But the truth of our system is I am in the same position as Prime Minister  Howard was, Prime Minister Keating was, Prime Minister Hawke was.  I am in no

different position presenting at this election.

O’BRIEN:  Can I suggest to you that you are, that there is one substantial  difference?  Nobody would have thought of replacing Bob Hawke in his first  term.  Nobody would have thought of replacing Paul Keating in his first term.   Nobody would have thought of replacing John Howard in his first term.  Kevin  Rudd was replaced in his first term.  Does that not set a new standard at least  as far as your Party is concerned, if it looks like you’re going to lose 2 years or

21/2 years into your next term, why wouldn’t they apply the same standard?

PM:  Well Kerry as we’re seeing played out somewhat spectacularly between  former Prime Minister Hawke and former Prime Minister Keating, our nation has  had these issues dealt with by political parties in office before.

O’BRIEN:  I think Paul Keating was at least prepared to give Bob Hawke 8 years.

PM:  Well, you know, we’re seeing that played out to a grand effect at the  moment, aren’t we?

O’BRIEN:  There’s anecdotal evidence, I think, at least strong anecdotal  evidence that many Labor voters are thinking of voting Green as a reflection of  their disillusionment with Labor, both in terms of how you’ve handled particular  policy areas but also because of the way the leadership has come to you.  But by

doing a deal with the Greens as you have now done to swap preferences, aren’t  you, that is Labor, just demonstrating that such a protest would be ineffectual  unless they give their preference to the Coalition or vote informal?

PM:  Well people will make their own decisions about where they want to put  their preferences.  Obviously there will be how to vote cards handed out.  These  questions are negotiated by our party secretary with other political parties.  I’ve  played no role in that.  So Kerry is my job to say to Australians generally,

whatever they’re thinking of voting now, is my job to persuade them that in  order to seize the best possible opportunities of the future, to do the things that  really matter for Australians, strong economy, budget surpluses, you know, first  class schools, health services they can rely on, tackling the challenges of climate

change that I am the leader with the vision and the plans to do that, then of  course I do.

O’BRIEN:  OK last question.  Since this election is very much about the  personalities, the strength of character, strengths and weaknesses of both  leaders. You’ve spent time talking about your strengths, nominate a weakness.

Nominate a weakness that you are aware about yourself.

PM:  A weakness I’m aware about myself.  Everybody in these circumstances  normally says they can work too hard.  I think that’s the classic politicians  answer.

O’BRIEN:  Oh Kevin Rudd said he didn’t work hard enough.  Go on.

PM:  I’ll probably give you another one.  I’ve been known to make the occasional  joke where media friends like you Kerry haven’t necessarily shared in the joke or  shared in the humour.

O’BRIEN:  So what, you have a humour that people don’t always understand?

PM:  Oh maybe a humour that people aren’t quite used to in a Prime Minister.

O’BRIEN:  Julia Gillard, thanks very much for talking with us.

PM: Thanks Kerry.
