TRANSCRIPT

Interview with Carrie Bickmore, David Hughes, Charlie Pickering and Megan  Gale  Channel Ten - The Project  10 April 2013

Topic: Asylum seekers

CARRIE BICKMORE: Jason Clare is the Minister for Home Affairs. Minister, this is the  first time in five years refugees have arrived on the mainland. Do you think seeing  these desperate asylum seekers up close changes the terms of the debate?

JASON CLARE:           Well it's a debate that's been poisoned by politics. Politicians  have been fighting about this for 10 years, and while we've been fighting people  have been dying. The people of Australia, whether they're in Geraldton or whether  they're here in Sydney or in Melbourne, want us to work together to sort this out.  But given the things Tony Abbott said today, I'm not hopeful at all.

DAVE HUGHES:         Mate, on the boat itself arriving at Geraldton, I mean, it's - is  that a worry that it was able to evade all Australia's, you know, defence forces? It  didn't look like a fast boat. I mean, how did it do that?

JASON CLARE:           The preliminary advice to me from Border Protection Command  is that the boat probably travelled directly from Sri Lanka to Geraldton which is a lot  further south than Christmas Island. Most of our patrol boats and our surveillance  aircraft are targeted at Christmas Island, and the area between Christmas Island and  Indonesia.

That's why I've asked Customs to review this, talk to the people on the boat,  understand why they travelled in this direction, and whether we need to reposition  our boats and our planes to make sure that this doesn't happen again.



CHARLIE PICKERING:            Now you say that politics has poisoned this. Thankfully  the law, including the High Court, helps clarify those things without politics getting in  the way. And legally, people landing in Australia do have a right to apply for asylum.  So can I ask, those that landed at Geraldton, did they ask to be accepted as refugees  in Australia?

JASON CLARE:           Charlie, I don't think they have, at least not at this point in time.  Because they've landed at Geraldton they won't be transferred to Nauru or to Manus  Island. They'll be flown to Christmas Island...

CHARLIE PICKERING:            So sorry, why were they flown to Christmas Island when  they landed on the mainland?

JASON CLARE:           Most of the processing of people seeking asylum occurs at  Christmas Island. All of the experts and all of the immigration officials are there. So  subject to their fitness to fly, they'll be flown to Christmas Island for that processing  to occur.

CHARLIE PICKERING:            But Geraldton isn't considered outside an exclusion zone  that we know about yet?

JASON CLARE:           No, it's not. And to pick up that point Charlie, legislation is in the  Parliament at the moment that would mean that if a boat arrives on the mainland  then people can still be transferred to Nauru or Manus Island. That legislation has  passed through the House of Representatives, it's in the Senate at the moment, and  when Parliament returns in May that legislation will hopefully be passed. And that  will reduce the incentive for people to try and travel more days at sea to hit the  mainland to avoid being transferred to Nauru or to Manus Island.

MEGAN GALE:           Okay Jason, and lastly but perhaps most importantly, what's to  become of these desperate people?

JASON CLARE:           Well they landed at Geraldton yesterday. They've been bussed  down to Perth and they're receiving health checks and fitness to fly checks now. And  subject to their fitness to fly, they'll be transferred to Christmas Island. And if they're  found not to be refugees then they'll be flown back to Sri Lanka.

CARRIE BICKMORE: Thank you for speaking with us tonight.

JASON CLARE:           Thanks everybody.
