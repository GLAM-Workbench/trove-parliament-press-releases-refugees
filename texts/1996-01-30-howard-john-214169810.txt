TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - OAKLEIGH, MELBOURNE

TOPICS:

HOWARD:

Ladies and gentlemen, this morning I am releasing the first instalment of a number o f  policies propositions that the Coalition will be taking to tire next election to bring about a  reinvigorated small business sector in the Australian community. I have said frequently  that getting small business going again in a really big way will do more than any other  single thing to reduce unemployment, particularly youth unemployment Generating real  jobs in the small business sector offers more hope to the young unemployed o f Australia

than any other single commitment that either side of politics can make.

There are many elements of a successful regeneration of small business. Reforming tire  industrial relations system including in particular the scrapping o f Labor’s unworkable  anti-employment, unfair dismissal laws, is one element of that change. There are

changes in relation to the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax that will be the  subject o f later announcements during the campaign, but today I want to confirm that we  will be legislating to vary the provisional tax uplift factor to bring it more into line with  reality somewhere in the order of 6% as opposed to the present 8% and that is at a  revenue cost of about $180 million.

Secondly, I will be establishing a small business deregulation taskforce. Thai taskforce  will have a specific brief from me as Prime Minister, to report within six months o f the  new Government taking office. Its main responsibility to it will be to advise on ways in  which the regulatory and paper burden on small business can be reduced by up to 50%.

It will have quite specific terms of reference and it will involve of course people from the  private sector who are very well aware of the regulatory burdens that are carried by small  business.

Thirdly, I will be legislating to establish an advisory council on taxation which will  report annually to parliament and its main role will be to over sight the operations o f the  taxation office.

And finally I’ll be rationalising the collection o f data by governments for small business  so much of the material which is now in Government hands for small business is not  available in an accessible form and it ought to be possible to rationalise that more  effectively.

Now, it is clear from the comments I have just made that the two key announcements I  make today relate to the provisional tax uplift factor and the establishment of the small  business deregulation task force. I regard both of them as very important commitments.  I am absolutely determined to cut the volume of red tape strangling the operation of  small business in Australia. The present Government has made a number o f half hearted

attempts to address this problem, but unless it is done in a systematic way involving  private sector people then it is not going to be effectively accomplished.

They represent the first instalment of our commitments to small business they represent a  determination on our part to give more incentive to small business, a revitalised incentive  driven, thriving small business sector will do more than anything else to cut youth  unemployment I find.........

MIDDLETON:

(inaudible)...suppoiting a cut in....

HOWARD:

Mr Middleton, I'm  going to invite questions in a moment Mr Middleton 1 thought that  there were some rules o f courtesy. 1 thought.... If you let me finish what I’m saying ÃÂ11  be happy to take questions from the media for 10 minutes, so if you would be so kind as  to allow me to finish, Mr Middleton, I will be then happy to answer your questions.

They represent the first instalment of our commitment in this area, this very important  area, because it is our very strong belief that revitalising the small business sector will do  more than anything else to reduce unemployment, particularly youth unemployment in  Australia.

MIDDLETON:

Mr Howard, why are you now supporting a reduction in the uplift factor when the  Democrats say your Party opposed it twice in the Senate in 1994 and 1995, when they  proposed i t

HOWARD:

We advocated the reduction to six on the last occasion this matter was discussed and we  have adopted it as policy.

JOURNALIST:

The Prime Minister said on Sunday that reducing the level of the uplift (inaudible) is no  more than a technical point It is not true policy.

HOWARD:

Well, that just shows how out of touch Ire is. Let every small business man and woman  in Australia understand that the Prime Minister thinks reducing the provisional tax  burden is a dot point in tax administration. I don’t think anybody who knows anything  about small business in Australia would possibly believe that this kind of measure, this  kind o f commitment, is just a dot point in tax administration. If he thinks that’s a  dot  point in tax administration he is even more out o f touch with small business than I  thought Ire was when he gave that infamous “what are they going on about" response to  the complaints o f small business on the John Laws program.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, the Prime Minister says your running from debating him, can you respond to  that please?

HOWARD:

I’d be delighted to respond to it - absolutely. I think I have made a big mistake in  relation to these debates and I have to confess to all of you I believed the Labor Party,  Andrew Robb and Gary Gray made a deal and their deal was that there would be two  debates. Those debates would be held three Sundays out from polling day on the 11th and

the next one on the 25th, and they shook hands on that deal, and I matte my campaign  arrangements accordingly and I’m going to stick to that deal. But within 24 hours Paul  Keating welched on a deal made in his name by the National Secretary o f tire Labor  Party. I was, I guess, unwise to believe him. If he welches on deals made to the  Australian public why wouldn’t he without any demur welcome a deal made with John

Howard.

JOURNALIST:

So you don’t accept his point view that the change of venue also means that the deal can  be changed ?

HOWARD:

No I don’t  I will debate Paul Keating twice. We’ll debate as agreed on the 11th and the  25th and that’s it I have made roy arrangements on that basis. I’m not going to alter my  arrangements, cancel commitments in Western Australia just at the whim of the Prime  Minister who told us in any event his authorisation shouldn’t have been believed.

Perhaps they ought to bring back Bob McMullan to act as the go-between between the  Prime Minister’s office and die National Secretary.

JOURNALIST: Â·.

(inaudible)

HOWARD:

No, there will not be a debate between Paul Keating and myself on the fourth. If he  wants to debate something else well he can go ahead. But I made a deal on sticking to  that deal. The only political leader in Australia over the last twelve years who has run  from a debate was Bob Hawke who refused to debate me at all - at all - in 1987.

JOURNALIST:

What is your reaction to Mr Kennett’s position on by-elections?

HOWARD:

Yes, I do - 1 love by-elections and I have had a very successful track record. 1 mean there  is Adelaide and there was Oxley where we almost picked up Bill Hayden’s old seat, there  was Flinders stretching back to 1982. I’m not sure it that it was all that flash o f us to  have done so well then but ...and of course most recently there has been Canberra.

Now Jeff governs Victoria and governs it very well and what arrangements he proposes  here are a matter for him and he’ll do it in his own way and his own effective style. But  for my part I won’t be abolishing by-elections in any form. I won’t be making any  changes. As I say I rather like by-elections.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, the Prime Minister has made an issue of Senator Vanstone’s attack on him  this morning do you stand...

HOWARD:

I haven’t hjard it

JOURNALIST:

Well, do you want me to go into the detail, it is rather grim.

It’s a preoccupation with faeces she says psychologically - he has read it at length on  ABC radio. Do you stand by that attack on Paul Keating from Senator Vanstone?

HOWARD:

Look, Paul Keating has regularly invoked the Goebbels analogy in order to criticise me,  to criticise I think the Australian Greens, to criticise all manner of people and for him to  sort of Feign indignation I think will bemuse and befuddle the Australian public in the  same way that he’s offended denial of ever delivering personal insults bemused and  befuddled them when he made that comment about ten days ago.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, you have accused the Prime Minister of repackaging material and trying to  sell it as new, you accused him of doing that yesterday, yet your new policy  announcement you announced it on the weekend Are you doing the same as you have  accused him of doing?

HOWARD:

I think there’s a bit o f a difference between two days and a couple of years.

PERSON:

Considering the youth vote is so important this time and they have lost face in the  Parliament because of the circus that it happens to be and I don’t expect an instant  answer from this, but would you consider electing a independent speaker like somebody  from die judiciary to bring back some decorum into the most important speech in our

country, because it i$ really, it doesn't do the politicians any good to be seen carrying on  like this? You don’t have to answer it now.

HOWARD:

No, I will be very happy to. I’m not in favour of having a Speaker who is not a member  of the parliament, but I am in favour of having an independent Speaker along the lines of  the independent Speaker at Westminster. I announced that in the first Headland speech I  made last year and that remains a firm commitment and there are other things that I will  do that will restore some respect for the Parliamentary institution. Another one o f th an

of course is that as Prime Minister 1 will attend Question Time every day that Parliament  sits. I wo-.i't have the appalling attendance record of my Labor opponent whose what  attended only 57 out of 111 days.

Now, there was another question from the press behind me.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating’s refusal to apologise to Mr Costello, your reaction to that?

HOWARD:

Well, entirely in the groove. I mean he has got an alleged threat a day. Who is he going  to allege tomorow morning on some radio program that somebody has threatened. I  mean we don’t go around threatening anybody and 1 think it is a mark that the Prime  Minister’s showing a bit of strain that he should be lashing out at Peter Costello, lashing  out at people making threats. I mean of course Costello has not made any threats that is  ridiculous. , ...............

JOURNALIST:

Are you saying two debates and two debates only on the two dates you have said?

HOWARD:

Yes, we made a deal on that and that’s it

JOURNALIST:

What about debates between Shadows?

HOWARD:

Well, they can be arranged as always.

JOURNALIST:

What about team debates?

HOWARD: Â·.

No, team debates. We are going to have Leader debates. We agreed on that What I am  doing is I’m sticking to the deal Andrew Robb went into that negotiation with my  authority, he reached a deal, he shook hands on it, there was no reference in the  discussion between Gray and Robb to the team debates. What was agreed was if we have  two debates between Howard and Keating, one on the 11th and on the 25th as far as the

Shadows a.-id the Ministers were concerned the idea was to hand all that over to the  National Press Club and they could organise them, but they’d have to make the  arrangements.

So that was discussed?

HOWARD:

O f course it was discussed, but not team debates.

JOURNALIST:

Why don’t you want Kerry O’Brien?

HOWARD:

I’m sorry...

JOURNALIST: ............... ................

Why don’t you want Kerry O’Brien to moderate?

HOWARD: ‘

Well, I’ve had a discussion with Mr O’Brien and we had a face to face discussion with  Mr O’Brien and I explained the basis of the views that have been put by Mr Robb in an  earlier discussion with Gary Gray. I don’t think it is appropriate for me to recapitulate  the details of that discussion, but let me say that I spoke directly to Mr O’Brien about the

matter.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, you’re here in a marginal seat in the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne. Dr  Wooldridge requires actually a swing to him to win i t How badly do you think the Party  is doing here in the Eastern Suburbs of Melbourne? There are six seat potentially at risk.

HOWARD:

How badly?

JOURNALIST: ,

Or how well.

HOWARD:

JOURNALIST:

ÃÂÃÂ·ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂ¹ p or?

I don’t think the Party is doing badly at all, but I don't want anybody here to get the least  bit complacent about our position. We have had a very good start to our campaign, but I  don't believe the polls that have given us this enormous lead to start off with. It is all  very nice to see them, but that’s going to change and it is going to tighten. It’s going to  get tougher and we are still genuinely the underdogs. Incumbency confers enormous  advantages. Â·

Now, Michael is a very good local Member and I have no doubt that he will hold his seat  I expect him to increase his majority. Now, whether that happens in every case will  depend upon the quality of local campaigns. I’m quite positive about our prospects in  Victoria, I really am, but it is going to be tough here as all over tire country and I really  would caution Liberals again, particularly here in Victoria, not to imagine that those polls  o f the last 48 hours are going to remain constant through tire campaign They’re not  Modem campaigns depend a lot on what happens during the course o f the campaign, so I  don’t  want anybody to get the least bit complacent, but I have to say that I’m well  pleased with progress to date, but we have got another 31 and a half days ahead o f us and  it’s not going to be easy.

JOURNALIST:

Will you cut politicians’ pay levels as the Liberals promised in ‘92?

HOWARD.

I’m sorry? '*

JOURNALIST:

Will you cut politicians’ pay levels as you promised in ‘92?

HOWARD:

I’m not proposing anything specific in that. What 1 can say to you is that we will be  sensible and reasonable in relation to that I don’t believe in excessive wage rises for  politicians but by the same token I think one has got to be realistic about the inducements  that are available for people who enter public life and there is a lot of hypocrisy mouthed

by a lot of people on the subject 1 think a lot of people who go into politics on both  sides make big sacrifices and most of them, I stress most of them on both sides, work  very hard. Actually, I think those on tire other side have misdirected and misguided  efforts but I don’t deny the fact that many of them work very hard. I’m not going to  engage in a populist thing on that. I will say as a warning to all of my colleagues that if

we do win the election we’re going to adopt an attitude of not asking people to accept the  standard that we’re not prepared to accept ourselves
