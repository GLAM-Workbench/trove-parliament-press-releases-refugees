SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AT RESETTLE. VT VILLAGE 2. S.

Statement by the Minis ter for the Ar Q

y nch,,, M,P .

About 12.00 South Vietnamese refugees are beginning to till land

allocated to them last weekend at the resettlement village of Ap Suoi Nghe, two miles

north of the Australian Task Force base at Nui Dat0

Commenting on the progress being made at Ap Suoi Ngtre, the Minister for the

Ary 9 Mr. Phillip Lynch, said the allocation of two-and-a-half acres of land to each of the families in the village, was a significant step forward in the Australian

ArmyÂ°s civic action programme in Pbuoc Tay Province,,

It is the first time in the lives of many of the peasants re=settled at Ap Suoi

Nghe that they have owned a blc;ok of land.

Mr. Lynch. said the village was established by the Australians last year

following an operation by two Australian battalions, .Before they were moved to Ap

Suoi Nghe the peasants were farming rented land at high rates or were squatting on

government land. The Viet Gong imposed taxes on them and collected rice and salt

from them and also obtained recruits from among the peasant families.

Ap Soui Nghe has been fostered and largely aided by the 1st Australian Civil

Affairs unit, now commanded by Lieuter..ant- Colonel Kevin Latchford of Mosman 9 NSW,, Four hundred and fifty acres of thick jungle and bamboo around the new village was

cleared earlier this year by engineers from the Australian Task Force and army

surveyors surveyed the area and subdivided it into family blocks.

Allocation of the land will mean that the people of Ap Soul Ng he  will soon

be able to be taken off South Vie w's list of refugees and will cease to rely on

Government Assistance,
