E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

SABRA LANE:

Mr Abbott, good morning and welcome to AM.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning Sabra.

SABRA LANE:

YouÃ¢ÂÂve called for a bipartisan approach on the Northern Territory, saying that you and the Prime Minister  should travel to the Alice Springs to talk with local leaders about this. WonÃ¢ÂÂt this just be more talk?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we have a very serious situation, Sabra, in Alice Springs and other towns in the Territory. The  intervention that the Howard Government launched and the current Government has continued has been  substantially successful in reducing social dysfunction in remote communities. But a lot of people who, letÃ¢ÂÂs  face it, want to drink and get up to the usual mischief theyÃ¢ÂÂve gone to towns like Alice and thatÃ¢ÂÂs  dramatically worsened social dysfunction there. So what IÃ¢ÂÂm proposing effectively is a new intervention in  Alice and the other major towns of the Territory like Katherine and Tennant Creek. I think it should be  bipartisan. I think that we do need to talk to the traditional owners and the senior elders before the thing is  finalised, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂve written to the Prime Minister about.

SABRA LANE:

Ok. In your letter you say there needs to be more police, more teachers, an insistence on Work for the Dole  and alcohol management measures. How many police, extra police, are you calling for?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I understand that Alice currently has about 200 police. Now, itÃ¢ÂÂs a town of about 30,000 people with  very significant social problems. If you take a town like Walgett in New South Wales, thatÃ¢ÂÂs got 3,000  people, it has 30 police. If you take a town like Ceduna in South Australia that has about 3,000 people, just

under 30 police. I would have thought that on a pro rata basis another hundred police would be the sort of  thing that youÃ¢ÂÂd be looking at. ItÃ¢ÂÂs pretty obvious just from the media report, such as Nicolas RothwellÃ¢ÂÂs  outstanding report a few weeks ago in The Australian, that there is a policing problem in Alice Springs.  Certainly if you go to the town camps as I have on a number of occasions there is no enforcement  whatsoever of existing alcohol restrictions in the town camps. Plainly the police need to do more.

SABRA LANE:

And how do you stop people from drinking? Are you talking about special alcohol laws for these areas?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs worked in the remote communities of the Territory. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no reason why more canÃ¢ÂÂt be done in  Alice and the other towns of the Territory, and that plainly means more effective policing and that really  means greater numbers.

SABRA LANE:

Have you got any idea as to what this would cost?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be cheap but I think that as with the intervention when youÃ¢ÂÂve got a serious social crisis  youÃ¢ÂÂve got to take serious measures to address it, and letÃ¢ÂÂs face it we have a Commonwealth budget of about  $350 billion a year. If this was to cost $10 or $20 million or even more than that I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs the kind of  money that a reasonable, decent, prudent government can find.

SABRA LANE:

YouÃ¢ÂÂre also talking about mandatory participation in school. How would you make that compulsory, and  some of these schools are in a really bad state of repair.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again, Sabra, I take the point that there is a culture of non-attendance with Indigenous kids in  Indigenous areas. Now, itÃ¢ÂÂs just unacceptable. In the end it does no good for anyone. ItÃ¢ÂÂs no good for the  Aboriginal kids because they end up unemployable and welfare dependant for life. ItÃ¢ÂÂs no good for the wider  community because these are youngsters who ought to be contributors when they get older and many of  them arenÃ¢ÂÂt. Now, this is a national failure. IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying itÃ¢ÂÂs the fault of any particular government or any  particular level of government. This is the fault of all of us and I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important that at the national level  we try to do better. The intervention has done very well. It hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been a magic wand, but it has succeeded  pretty well in most of the remote communities. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I say we need a new intervention in the towns  like Alice because thatÃ¢ÂÂs where the problems have transferred to.

SABRA LANE:

YouÃ¢ÂÂve acknowledged in your letter, too, that it needs to be guided by Indigenous leadership, saying that the  2007 intervention under John Howard was just too top-heavy. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs code for you had it wrong.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying that at all, Sabra. I think that John Howard and Mal Brough did a magnificent job with  the intervention in 2007. DonÃ¢ÂÂt forget the intervention in 2007 was an emergency response. It had to be  something that was done quickly. This is something in Alice and the other towns of the Territory thatÃ¢ÂÂs been

3

building up over time. I think this intervention does need a period of consultation with the elders, but in the  end the Government must act and you canÃ¢ÂÂt await consensus. You do have to act, but I think as far as is  humanly possible government should take people into its confidence before rather than after it takes decisive  action.

SABRA LANE:

YouÃ¢ÂÂre written this letter and youÃ¢ÂÂve released it. The Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin says that  you are grandstanding.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a little unfair. IÃ¢ÂÂve certainly had two discussions with the Prime Minister on this. Sure, they  havenÃ¢ÂÂt been lengthy discussions but you donÃ¢ÂÂt want to trespass too much on the time of a Prime Minister  until youÃ¢ÂÂve got a crystallised thought. Jenny Macklin and Nigel Scullion have had at least one face to face  discussion about this. Nigel has been in discussion with Jenny MacklinÃ¢ÂÂs office. There were some modest  measures that the Government took a week or so back, $4 million for extra lighting, for additional family  services and for more Work for the Dole places in Alice Springs. I think those measures were probably  prompted by the initial discussions between Jenny Macklin and Nigel Scullion. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs good that the  Government has responded in this way, but I think it is a very modest response to a very serious problem  and I think quite a bit more is needed.

SABRA LANE:

These suggestions, is this an attempt by you to sort of head off that criticism that youÃ¢ÂÂve just become the Ã¢ÂÂDr  NoÃ¢ÂÂ if you like of Australian politics? YouÃ¢ÂÂve said no to just about everything.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if you look at the last couple of months IÃ¢ÂÂve offered to sit down with the Prime Minister and talk in a  bipartisan way about spending cuts needed to avoid the flood tax, IÃ¢ÂÂve publicly offered to sit down with the  Prime Minister and talk about welfare reform measures to improve participation. I think that where there is a  degree of unity, at least in terms of the objective, we ought to be able to sit down and work together. But on  other subjects thereÃ¢ÂÂs just no agreement and thatÃ¢ÂÂs where IÃ¢ÂÂm very happy to say no.

SABRA LANE:

What happens in the Alice if there is no further intervention here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the situation will slowly get worse and worse. Alice will become, it will become a divided  town. It will become a town where middle class people live in fear, where we have gated communities as it  were, where after dark the place becomes a jungle. ItÃ¢ÂÂs already getting a long way down that path and it  would be a tragedy for that to happen. The social problems of Alice would not be tolerated for a day if they  were taking place in Sydney or Melbourne. WeÃ¢ÂÂve put up with it for too long for, I think, cultural reasons. I  can understand the reluctance of people to intervene given the history, but sometimes youÃ¢ÂÂve just got to take  a stand and as I said this is a developing social crisis. The reporting of Nicolas Rothwell in The Australian;  the heartfelt passionate plea of Ted Egan, the former administrator of the Territory who said that if anything  the problems are worse than Rothwell reported; the comments of Alison Anderson, the heroic independent  member for much of that part of central Australia. We do have a serious problem. Business as usual is not  good enough.

SABRA LANE:

Mr Abbott, just on the carbon tax. If Julia Gillard picks up this idea put forward by Ross Garnaut linking the  carbon tax to widespread tax cuts and boosting pensions, youÃ¢ÂÂre pretty much snookered arenÃ¢ÂÂt you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this is just a thought bubble from Ross Garnaut at the moment. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all it is. But I want to make this  point…

SABRA LANE:

He seemed to flesh it out in great detail.

TONY ABBOTT:

I do want to make this point. A tax cut to compensate for a tax increase is not a cut, itÃ¢ÂÂs a con. If my  household is paying an extra $2,000 a year in the carbon tax and the Government says to me Ã¢ÂÂoh hereÃ¢ÂÂs a  thousand dollars backÃ¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a tax cut, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a net tax hike. The whole point about this carbon tax is that  youÃ¢ÂÂve got to pay more, because if you donÃ¢ÂÂt pay more itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to change your behaviour.

SABRA LANE:

YouÃ¢ÂÂve promised to repeal it if you win office. YouÃ¢ÂÂll be repealing tax cuts too?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, all weÃ¢ÂÂve seen from this Government so far is a thought bubble from Ross Garnaut which the  Prime Minister has clutched at like a drowning person clutching at a passing rope. But I want to make it very  clear that a tax cut to compensate for a tax hike is not a cut, itÃ¢ÂÂs a con.

SABRA LANE:

Should I set my watch for ten to three today for you trying to stop Question Time to debate or censure the  Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, I think that what youÃ¢ÂÂll see from the Coalition this week is a very strong critique of a Government which  is dishonest and incompetent. I mean, dishonest when it comes to the carbon tax. LetÃ¢ÂÂs never forget this is a  Prime Minister who said “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.” Does anyone imagine  that Julia Gillard would be in The Lodge today if sheÃ¢ÂÂd been honest six days out from the election and said  Ã¢ÂÂthere will be a carbon tax under a government I lead,Ã¢ÂÂ and itÃ¢ÂÂs utterly incompetent. This is a Prime Minister  who said ten days ago that the situation on Christmas Island is under control. Plainly itÃ¢ÂÂs not under control  and I challenge the Prime Minister to give a guarantee that none of those individuals who have been guilty  of violence against property, against persons on Christmas Island will get permanent residency of our  country.

SABRA LANE:

Just on that last point. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs talk in Fairfax newspapers today that the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs looking at a new  class of visa category for asylum seekers whoÃ¢ÂÂve been identified and judged as being genuine refugees to  allow them out in the community but with strict reporting conditions. Would you support that?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is before there have been security checks?

SABRA LANE:

Yes.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think basically this is a Government which is constantly watering down our border protection.  Constantly watering down our border protection. Constantly encouraging the people smugglers to offer hope  to people overseas. Now, the only way to stop the boats is deny the people smuggles a product to sell and  that means you have to amongst other things reintroduce temporary protection visas. So people who come  by boat should get temporary protection visas, they should not get something that promises them permanent  residency.

SABRA LANE:

Mr Abbott, thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much.
