ONE (MULTICULTURAL) AUSTRALIA; DEMOCRATS

Senator Jean Jenkins, Australian Democrats spokesperson on   Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, today responded to the call by   the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Howard, for O n e  Australia'  in   the Liberal Manifesto.

"Mr. Howard's notion of 'One Australia' is divisive and

dangerous," said Senator Jenkins. "The Coalition is purveying an   u n s a v o u r y  sort of nationalism. Mr. Howard is inviting his   s u p p o r t e r s  to bring out their prejudices, in the name of

Australian unity. ;

"Mr. Howard invokes 'an over-riding commitment to Australia and   the Australian way of life', without recognising that Australia   is in essence a diversity of peoples," said Senator Jenkins.   "Those Australians who suffer from xenophobia and racial   prejudice will find the encouragement they want in the Liberal   Manifesto.

S e n a t o r  Jenkins was critical of Mr. Howard's favouring in   increase in the migrant intake, and altering its composition so   as to make it 'more directly attuned to our economic needs.'

"Humanitarian needs are paramount," said Senator Jenkins. "We support refugee programmes and the family reunion scheme,   ahead of the so-called economic needs."

Senator Jenkins said that she endorsed the view that migrants   regarded as economic units to be exploited, would become

economic exploiters in turn, and exploit us.

Senator Jenkins said that the Australian Democrats, as a matter   of poli cy ,  support the concept and practice of 'democratic   pluralism' or multiculturalism.
