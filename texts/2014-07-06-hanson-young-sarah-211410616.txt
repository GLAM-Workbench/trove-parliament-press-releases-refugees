Morrison must come clean ahead of Sri Lanka visit

“It has been over a week since the government ‘disappeared’ over 200 asylum seekers bound for  Australia", Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

"The veil of secrecy must be lifted before Minister Morrison travels to Sri Lanka.

“The Governments arguments for secrecy based on "operational matters" are wearing thin. I will put  motion to parliament this week calling the government to explain exactly what has been taking place  on the high seas and to condemn the transfer of asylum seekers back to their accused persecutors.

"This will be a test for the new Senate. The Minister seems to believe he is above both the law and  the Parliament. The Senate can show him that his contempt for the Australian public is wrong.

“The Australian pubic deserve to know what is going on and whether or not these vulnerable asylum  seekers are safe.

“The Minister must be upfront about the discussions he will be having with Sri Lankan authorities  and whether or not he will be discussing the protection of people they have forcibly returned.”
