10 April 2013

$7.9 million for partnership projects to improve the health of Australians

Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek today announced $7.9 million for 11 Partnerships for Better  Health - Partnership Projects including research into medication regimes for kidney transplants,  chlamydia testing, work-related asthma and cancer, suicide prevention, and mental health  disorders in rural children.

Ms Plibersek made the announcement today at the University of Adelaide where she met with  grant recipient Professor John Lynch who will receive $273,131 for a whole-of-population study  into child health and development.

This study is supported by the Australian Government and project partners from the Women's and  Children's Health Network and the South Australian Department for Education and Child  Development.

“The Australian Government is focussed on improved patient care, better disease prevention and  more cost-effective delivery of services,” Ms Plibersek said.

Jointly funded through the National Health and Medical Research Council and partners, the grants  will encourage alliances between partners who deliver health care services, partners who make  decisions about health practice, and researchers who can offer tailored, evidence-based solutions.

"This aligns with recommendations from the recently released McKeon Review's call to imbed  research into all facets of the health system,” Ms Plibersek said.

"Collaboration in research provides a great example of where the whole is greater than the sum of  parts."

The Partnership Project partners include Commonwealth and State agencies, hospitals, medical  research institutes, and patient advocacy groups.

“Each partner has an important contribution to make and comes to the table to find workable  solutions to a set of problems. By encouraging collaboration, we can share our knowledge and  experiences and pool our resources to get the most out of research to benefit Australians,” Ms  Plibersek said.

Work-related asthma and cancer are largely preventable conditions however there is a need to  understand the risks faced by workers in order to direct prevention policy and practice. The team  will survey 5000 Australian workers to estimate the exposure to asthma - and cancer - causing  agents in the workplace. This partnership between university researchers and government and  non-government organisations will provide a sound basis for determining how to decrease the  number of these occupational diseases.  ----------------------------------------------------------------



Queensland

Chief Investigator A:  Professor Suzanne Chambers

Funding amount:   $587,271

Approximately 35% of people diagnosed with cancer will experience persistent significant distress.  Psychological supportive care needs in Australian cancer patients are highly prevalent.  The web  presents a unique method of delivery of supportive care, however to our knowledge this type of  intervention has not been examined. This two-phased study will develop and test a novel web-based intervention to improve psychological outcomes in cancer patients experiencing distress.  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Falls are a leading cause for presentation to Emergency Departments (EDs) by older patients.  More than 50% who present to ED with a fall injury have fallen in the previous year. RESPOND is  an innovative post-ED discharge program designed to reduce secondary falls in older people.  RESPOND extends current falls prevention research and practice by incorporating patient-centred  education with behaviour change strategies proven to be effective in the secondary prevention of  cardiovascular events.  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Innovation in system redesign and service delivery will result in  sustainable improvements in access to, and quality of, care and measurable improvements in  maternal, newborn and child health.   ----------------------------------------------------------------



Title:  Should Australia introduce a national chlamydia testing program?

Research Institution:   University of Melbourne

Partner organisations:   Ã¯ÂÂ· Royal Australian College of General Practitioners  Ã¯ÂÂ· Australian Practice Nurses Association  Ã¯ÂÂ· NSW Ministry of Health  Ã¯ÂÂ· Victorian Department of Health



Chief Investigator A:  Associate Professor Jane Hocking

Funding amount:   $492,397

Chlamydia is a very common sexually transmissible infection that can lead to infertility in women.  About 4% of young adults have the infection, yet most are unaware they have it. Chlamydia is  easy to diagnose and treat, but it is not known whether annual testing can reduce its spread. Over  one million tests are conducted each year in general practice, costing the government $30 million.  This evaluation of a well-established trial of chlamydia testing in young adults will resolve the  debate of whether annual testing works and is a good use of money.
