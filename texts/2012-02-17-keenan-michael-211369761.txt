MTR Interview with Luke Grant

Topics: Latest Boat Arrivals / Labor’s Border Protection Crisis

Luke Grant

I want to talk to Michael Keenan now, the Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection  and we will see exactly where things are here and in particular the cost of all of this. G’day Michael.

Michael Keenan

G’day Luke, nice to talk to you.

Luke Grant

Yeah good to talk to you again mate thanks. First off on that comment from Chris Bowen today, I mean  you must just laugh mustn’t you?

Michael Keenan

Well I’m not sure I could summarise it as well as you just have Luke. Its not a policy to just put out a  press release every time there is a new boat arrival and say that it is somebody else’s fault when you  are the ones who are actually occupying the Treasury benches that form Government. The sad thing  about it is whilst they continue to have this strategy of just saying its not our fault we are not  responsible its someone else’s fault, then clearly that is not a mind set where you are ever going to  actually do anything to solve the problem and until they admit it’s the policy mistakes that they made  when they came to office that caused this in the first place, I don’t see any prospect of them regaining  control of our borders. Whilst that is the case we are just going to have these people smugglers  bringing people down to Australia whenever they see fit. That is the very sad situation that we have  come to now and that’s why the Australian tax payer is having to bear these enormous costs, that you  referred to in your introduction.

Luke Grant

Yes indeed. I noticed the other day that yourself and Scott Morrison put out a release that basically  said that instead of doing the job as immigration minister Chris Bowen was in fact writing a job  application to be Kevin Rudd’s Treasurer. It’s a great line, do you really think though that the disruption  in the leadership in the Government is causing a Minister, typically like Chris Bowen, to take his eye of  the ball? Surely there is enough people to just get this job done?

Michael Keenan

It is not just Chris Bowen it is the whole Government that has turned completely internally and are now  focusing on their own political distractions and problems. The Government is completely paralysed,  completely dysfunctional and absolutely nothing is happening in terms of any sort of strategic policy or  direction for this country. Until they resolve this issue of the leadership between them, I suspect it is

going to be impossible for them to start to address some of these problems that Australia has. I have to  say that Chris Bowen is perhaps one of the worst examples of it, he wants to be Kevin Rudd’s  Treasurer and he is totally preoccupied with that. On the day when we had the two boat arrivals his  contribution to the debate was to write an opinion piece in The Australian talking about the economy,  which is pretty sad when he has pretty significant responsibilities for our country but clearly he is  completely distracted and is not turning his mind onto those responsibilities and that is just another  problem we have before we get any kind of semblance of border protection back.

Luke Grant

I’m excited to do the counting of this, have we had more than 300 arrivals in 48 hours, is it that bad?

Michael Keenan

Yes that’s exactly right, we have had four boats arrive in 48 hours and I think what we are seeing is as  the weather pattern becomes less severe in the north of our country the people smugglers have gone  back into full swing. Clearly we are going to see a very bad year for Australia in terms of people  smugglers being able to bring people down here. The Government is just completely distracted with  other things and their response is just to say it’s not our fault its Tony Abbott’s fault. I just cannot see  whilst this Government remains how we are going to get any different result and the only way we are  going to have a border protection policy again in Australia is when the Government is changed.

Luke Grant

That is what it sounds like. Now I know there is $4 billion dollars spent on the asylum seeker budget or  that is the blow-out since the election of the Rudd Government. They took the knife to the Private  Health Insurance Rebate this week so I guess that will fill in part of that hole but one of the other  concerns surely must be during the Budget estimates I think the Government said that they were  assuming 450 arrivals per month, well we have had over 300 in 48 hours so we have a problem  haven’t we?

Michael Keenan

We have a very severe problem and even if that rate were true where we had 450 people arrive per  month that represents a very severe problem for Australia but now that looks like it is going to be an  underestimate of the number of people that we are going to get on any given month. The costs  associated with this are just so enormous, that $4 billion figure its actually slightly under it at $3.9  billion and the Private Health Insurance Rebate means test was going to recruit for the Government  $2.7 billion, so you can see that this is why they have to go out and hit Australians to pay for their failed  policies on border protection. Australians are paying a very high cost for Labor’s incompetence on this.

Luke Grant

And are in so many other areas. Michael thanks for your time mate, good to talk to you.

Michael Keenan

Great to talk to you Luke.
