PRESENTER:

One person who has spent a good deal of time campaigning against the Carbon Tax is the  opposition Treasurer Joe Hockey and Joe is on the line. Joe Hockey - good morning.

JOE HOCKEY:

Good Morning John.

PRESENTER:

Did you hear the Prime Minister?

JOE HOCKEY:

I did.

PRESENTER:

What do you make of all that?

JOE HOCKEY:

I just think if she was honest with the Australian people, people would listen to her. But I  think a lot of people have switched off because they feel they’re being spun a line rather  than being told the true story.

PRESENTER:

Are they being spun a line?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well inevitably yes. When the Prime Minster says that everyday Australians aren’t going to  pay the carbon tax - Australians know that businesses pass it on. Australians know this is  going to increase the cost of electricity and everyone uses electricity. It is a tax on energy.  And any energy we use over time is going to be affected by the Carbon Tax. In every single  area of our life, and the more manufactured a good, the greater the use of energy, the  greater the impact of the Carbon Tax.

PRESENTER:

Well she has accused you of over exaggerating the affect of the tax. Do you believe you  have?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well not at all. Not at all. The Government is very keen to say that Tony Abbott said that  Whyalla would be wiped off the map. It was in fact, Wayne Hanson, State Secretary of the  Australian Workers Union.

PRESENTER:

Who made that statement?

JOE HOCKEY:

He said it, he said ‘Goodbye, they will be wiped off the map’. He said it is ridiculous to  consider. This is a union official, he says ‘it is ridiculous to consider a Carbon Tax when you  don’t have other countries that are prepared to adopt a common approach. To allow your

steel industry to disintegrate is just reckless. Should we be the trailblazer?’ That was a  union official. So Tony Abbott is out there quoting union officials who are holding up the  Labor Party.

PRESENTER:

Exactly.

JOE HOCKEY:

We are criticised for it. The Prime Minister didn’t mention today that for the first time in  years we are seeing an increase in marginal tax rates. The 15 percent rate is going to 19  percent. The 30 per cent rate is going to 32.5 per cent. And then they are giving money  back in other ways and paying industry compensation, if there was no injury you wouldn’t  need compensation.

PRESENTER:

That’s the thing I can’t understand. It seems they are taking it away with one hand and  giving it back with the other.

JOE HOCKEY:

Exactly. And for what John, for what? To see our carbon emissions increase, actually  increase from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes.

PRESENTER:

Why are they going to increase?

JOE HOCKEY:

They are going to continue to grow. As our economy grows the emissions will continue to  grow, and the tax is not going to do anything to actually reduce our emissions. That is the  thing, the Treasury modelling that the Prime Minister cites assumes that the rest of the  world is going to go ahead with a carbon tax, or the equivalent. They are not. They’re not.  They are desperately trying to stay above water in Europe, flailing,  the United States is  bouncing along, China is coming off its previous levels of growth, and here is Australia  making everything we do more expensive with a new tax. This is absurd.

PRESENTER:

Well it seems on the surface to be absurd. The Government is giving literally billions of  dollars away in compensation, pensioners are going to get $250 a year, tax free threshold  is going to increase as you said. If you repeal the tax will those payments be taken away?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we will have more to say on the compensation measures for individuals and  pensioners before the next election, and everything depends on the timing of the next  election. But I can say to you John that certainly with business, if there is no pain you don’t  need compensation.

PRESENTER:

If there is no pain you don’t need compensation.

JOE HOCKEY:

We are going to get rid of that tax. I can tell you, this is not like the GST.

PRESENTER:

How can you get rid of it through? Can you just walk in there and say ‘Well that is over’.

JOE HOCKEY:

You pass legislation through the Parliament. You pass legislation through the Parliament to  repeal the Carbon Tax.

PRESENTER:

Would you get it through the Parliament?

JOE HOCKEY:

You know John we would and I will tell you why. Speaking very bluntly after being in the  Howard Government for 11 years, I soon realised like my colleagues did in 2008 after we  had lost the election, that if we didn’t accept the verdict of the people in 2007 they would  never listen to us again. So when the government put up legislation to repeal WorkChoices  we allowed it through the Parliament because we knew that the electorate would never  listen to our word again, if we didn’t respect the decision of the electorate.  Now Labor, if  they are thrashed at the next election, they will be mugged by reality that the electorate will  never listen to Labor again until they recognise that the electorate did not want the Carbon  Tax. They will let us pass it through the Parliament. If they don’t, then we will go back to the  polls.

PRESENTER:

That’s interesting. Do you believe that humans cause climate change?

JOE HOCKEY:

My instinct is that yes, human beings do contribute to climate change. I have always  believed that. There is some scientific debate about it, but I, on the balance of probabilities,  go with the science. I think we should do something about it, and that’s why we have a  direct action plan. But I certainly do not believe that given we are one and a half per cent of  the worlds emissions, I certainly believe that all we are doing is cutting off our nose to spite  our face if we take drastic action, which the Carbon Tax is drastic action, when the rest of  world is not doing any heavy lifting.  In fact in Europe, I need to confirm this, but I  understand in Europe, the Carbon Tax raised by 30 countries is roughly a third of what this  government is going to raise in its first year of the Carbon Tax in one country, Australia.

PRESENTER:

That’s an interesting number.

JOE HOCKEY:

This is the biggest economy wide Carbon Tax in the world.

PRESENTER:

Yeah.

JOE HOCKEY:

The Europeans have so many exemptions to their emissions trading scheme. The last point  I saw their equivalent is around $10 dollars.

PRESENTER:    The administration is going to be hugely expensive anyway, isn’t it?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes. The Government employed last year nearly 1, 000 people to run the program. It is  coming down to 600 people this year. But that’s an ongoing cost, and it is just typical. The  expenses are monstrous for running this program. It is just a money shuffle John. You  identified it before, it is a money shuffle.

PRESENTER:

Tell me this, just on another subject, we believe, and I am sure you agree, we have the  greatest nation in the world, but can’t we do better when it comes to asylum seekers, for  god’s sake?

JOE HOCKEY:

We can do better. We can do better. We were part of the Government that made hard  decisions but we didn’t sell our soul in the process of doing it. We maintained Australian  values. We had a three pronged approached as everyone knows. We had off-shore  processing, we had temporary protection visas, and where it was safe and possible to do  so we would turn back a boat.  That’s what we offered again.  It was Kevin Rudd - to be fair  to Julia Gillard - it was Kevin Rudd that unwound it. It was Kevin Rudd that unwound it. And

Julia Gillard promised an East Timor Solution and then she figured she could go with  onshore processing, and then she figured she could go with Malaysia. She has had more  positions on this, than Brett Kenny played positions in Rugby League.

PRESENTER:

As I said to you, Australia is, we believe, the greatest nation. How could the Parliament of  sensible people, or allegedly of sensible people, not come to an agreement over this issue,  which is virtually life or death?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it was policy on the run from the government and it was an inglorious week in  Parliament.

PRESENTER:

Sure was.

JOE HOCKEY:

It is an issue that creates a great deal of debate. It is an issue that generates a lot of  emotion and frankly John, you know, I mean we can solve this issue, but the government is  too proud to say, let’s go back to the formula that worked and we’re not moving from the  formula that worked.  We’re not plucking policy out of the air. We actually want them to use  a formula that worked and go back to it.

PRESENTER:

You were very emotional.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, for a whole lot of reasons, it’s a tough issue for me.

PRESENTER:

What other reasons apart from the obvious one?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well my father came as a refugee to Australia in 1948. He was born in Bethlehem in  Palestine and in 1998 I went and walked with him through the refugee camps in a number  of countries over there and I thought but for the grace of God. There isn’t a day that he isn’t  proud to be an Australian. And I can understand the desperation of the people wanting to  come here. As you said “this is the greatest country on earth” and why wouldn’t you want to  go to the greatest country on earth? And you’d be desperate for it. I just cannot understand  how a parent could put an unaccompanied child on a boat.

PRESENTER:

Neither can I.

JOE HOCKEY:

That’s akin to manslaughter in my view, or attempted manslaughter. Therefore I feel  particularly for those children. And the government, the interesting thing is, it was the Labor  government that helped my father come here in 1948 and I reckon Ben Chifley would be  spinning in his grave at the lack of principles from this mob in Canberra.

PRESENTER:

I reckon he would too.

JOE HOCKEY:

At the lack of compassion in Canberra. He would be appalled that this government would  suggest that it would pick up an unaccompanied 10 year old child out of the ocean and go  and dump them in another country and say goodbye and have no regard for their welfare  and that’s exactly what Labor is saying is the solution and it’s never been a solution in my  mind.

PRESENTER:

What other nation besides Nauru would the Coalition accept to send asylum seekers?

2/09/2013 http://www.joehockey.com/media/transcripts/details.aspx?s=350

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we’ve offered more than 140 nations, I think it’s 147 that are signatories to the UN  convention.

PRESENTER:

And they were all rejected?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the government is just saying ‘no, it’s not good enough’. But we also have Manus  Island which is off Papua New Guinea. And I understand the mosquitos there are as large  as a Holden Commodore but it was an effective place to process applications. And the  thing about Nauru, John, which a lot of people aren’t aware of, the government, keeps  saying most of them end up here - that’s just factually not true. For every 100 that went to  Nauru, 30 were sent back to the country that they came from, 27 would end up in another  country somewhere in the rest of the world and the rest would come to Australia. It was  roughly only 43% which would come to Australia, which meant that when the people  traffickers were going to sell guaranteed passage to Australia they didn’t necessarily get  guaranteed passage to Australia and what’s more, if they came to Australia, they were put  on Temporary Protection Visas which is the biggest part of it all. The most significant part of  it all if you weren’t guaranteed permanent residency and that meant that the traffickers had  nothing to sell. They couldn’t guarantee a life in Australia for those people they were trying  to sell the product to.

PRESENTER:

But people were still buying it Joe.

JOE HOCKEY:

Some were, but they stopped. They got down to, I think it was, a boat a year and we in the  last 48 hours or 72 hours have had something like three or four boats.

PRESENTER:

We have.

JOE HOCKEY:

It is I think the cruellest thing we can possibly do is to allow people to get on boats and  come here and the government has just got to recognise that sometimes you take what the  Parliament gives you.

PRESENTER:

But Joe we can’t stop them getting on the boats.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well at the moment we can’t and I expect that the Prime Minister should have a resolution  with the President of Indonesia. I know when you asked her, I was listening carefully, when  you asked her a very good question, and you were going to discuss it, she talked around  the bush for about two minutes and I thought she’d never get to it and then at the end she  could see that she’d have to raise it. Of course she has to raise it. We’ve got to work with  our neighbours. Somehow John, the Labour Party has managed to upset every relationship

in our region.

JOE HOCKEY:

The Chinese - Kevin Rudd went there, first trip to China, he goes up to a university, I think  it was Beijing University, before he’d even met the Premier of China, and in perfect  Mandarin gives them a lecture about Human Rights.

PRESENTER:

Yeah I know.

JOE HOCKEY:

I mean can you imagine if they came out to Australia and the first thing the Premier of  China did was go out to a University, in perfect English, and give a lecture about how we’ve  treated indigenous Australians. We wouldn’t be too impressed. And then Julia Gillard  comes in and announces she’s going to put a detention centre in East Timor without  speaking to the East Timorese government. The equivalent of speaking to the Governor  General, she spoke to the equivalent of their Government General without speaking to the  East Timorese Prime Minster. And then, with Indonesia, they upset them because Kevin  Rudd had what they called ‘Megaphone Diplomacy’ over a boat and really upset the  Indonesians. And then they go and deal with Malaysia that effectively humiliates Malaysia  because they government had it struck down by our own High Court.

PRESENTER:

Exactly.

JOE HOCKEY:

So how could they upset everyone in the region and then expect to work with them to stop  the boats?

PRESENTER:

I don’t know but you’ve made some very valid points. It was good of you to give us some  time and you gave us plenty of it too Joe. Thanks.

JOE HOCKEY:

Any time, any time for you John.

PRESENTER:

Thanks, bye - Joe Hockey, telling us how he believes it is. Never one to shy away from a  strong discussion Joe and I think that’s one of the things that a lot of Australians like about  him and I think a lot of Australians like a great deal about Joe Hockey.
