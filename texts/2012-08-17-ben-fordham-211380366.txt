E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

BEN FORDHAM:

Good morning to you, Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Ben.

BEN FORDHAM:

We’ll kick off overseas if we can, to Julian Assange, the developing story out of London. He’s been granted  asylum by Ecuador but the British Government is refusing to grant him safe passage to the airport. Should  they?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ben, it’s a matter for the British Government and what’s right under British law. I’m sure the British  Government will apply the ordinary law of Britain to this matter and that’s the way it should be.

BEN FORDHAM:

He’s an Australian citizen. Are you concerned about his welfare? Shouldn’t they grant him that safe passage  under international law?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s whatever the ordinary law of Britain is; whatever would happen to anyone else in the same  circumstances. Julian Assange should get identical treatment to anyone else in a similar position.

BEN FORDHAM:

I mean, he’s not in a similar position to many people, is he? I mean, he’s a huge enemy of the United States  administration and there are suggestions that the charges that he’s facing in Sweden have been trumped up  somewhat. Have you had a look at those allegations against Julian Assange in relation to the sexual assault?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well the point, Ben, is that he should be dealt with in accordance with ordinary law. He should get every  opportunity to defend himself under ordinary law.

BEN FORDHAM:

Ok. He’s an Australian citizen, Mr Abbott, in a very prickly position. Is politics getting in the way of your  view?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, Ben. I think that he should be given all the assistance which the Australian Government would give to  any Australian in trouble abroad.

BEN FORDHAM:

It’s two years since Julia Gillard’s ‘no carbon tax’ promise. You’re never let her forget it, are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, she shouldn’t forget it because it was a fundamental breach of faith. It wasn’t just a broken promise, it  was a failure to get it. She just doesn’t understand the magnitude of her betrayal. To say one thing before an  election to win votes and to do the opposite after the election to stay in The Lodge, this means that the next  election is going to be not just a referendum on the carbon tax, Ben, but a referendum on Prime Ministers  who don’t tell the truth.

BEN FORDHAM:

Tony Windsor, the independent MP, jumped to his feet in Parliament yesterday and then turned his guns on  you. One of the things he said was that, ‘The Leader of the Opposition knows very well, because on a  number of occasions he actually begged for the job. You have never denied it Tony and you will not.’

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Ben, I have denied it and the interesting thing here is that Tony Windsor’s changed his story. Back in  October of 2010 he said that I didn’t want it enough. Now he says that I wanted it too much. But self-evidently, one thing I wasn’t prepared to do was to put in a carbon tax. I wasn’t prepared to breach a pre-election commitment, which the Prime Minister self-evidently was.

BEN FORDHAM:

Did you beg him for the job?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course not, of course not. No, look, I think Tony Windsor is just embarrassed that along with Bob Brown,  he is responsible for putting in place the worst government in Australia’s history.

BEN FORDHAM:

Let’s have a listen to more of what Tony Windsor said yesterday. He was looking back on those weeks when  there were negotiations going on between the independents, Julia Gillard the Prime Minister, and also  yourself. Here’s Tony Windsor:

TONY WINDSOR:

You would well remember, and your colleagues should be aware, that the only codicil that you put on that  was, ‘I will do anything, Tony, to get this job. The only thing I wouldn’t do is sell my arse.’

BEN FORDHAM:

Did you utter those words Mr Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course not. Of course not, Ben. It’s not the language that I would ever use and as I said, self-evidently, I  wasn’t prepared to do anything to become Prime Minister because self-evidently, unlike Julia Gillard, I  wasn’t prepared to put in a carbon tax in clear breach of pre-election commitments. Look, this is what this is  all about. It’s about a Prime Minister whose tenure is tainted by this fundamental breach of faith: ‘There will  be no carbon tax under the government I lead’. Now we’ve got a carbon tax which is bad for jobs, bad for  every Australian’s cost of living. She’s desperate, desperate to try to slide out from underneath this big lie  and Tony Windsor is embarrassed at the fact that he is backing such a monumentally bad government.

BEN FORDHAM:

On to another issue which is asylum seekers and boat arrivals. It’s taken the Prime Minister some time to  come around to your view on offshore processing…

TONY ABBOTT:

Four years, Ben.

BEN FORDHAM:

...yeah, many years.

TONY ABBOTT:

Four long years.

BEN FORDHAM:

You now have a situation though where you’ve got the Coalition and the Government agreeing on  something at least, although the Greens still do not agree with either of you. Here is the Greens’ Sarah  Hanson-Young:

SARAH HANSON-YOUNG:

The Coalition love people coming on boats. That’s how Tony Abbott plans to win the election.

BEN FORDHAM:

Is that the plan, Mr Abbott?  Is that how you plan to win the election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ben, the plan is to stop the boats and I’m pleased that the Government this week adopted just one of the  three essential elements, if we are going to stop the boats. It’s good that we’re now going to have processing  at Nauru, although I’m not sure that this government’s going to be able to deliver it very effectively, but  we’ve also got to have temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell and we’ve  got to have the willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so. My fear is that Julia Gillard’s heart  and the Labor Party’s heart just isn’t in this and under this government we’ll always have the boats coming.

BEN FORDHAM:

We’ve got a Bledisloe Cup game this weekend - Australia, New Zealand in the rugby. Richard Wilkins is  killing us with all of his predictions for the Kiwis to win. Mr Abbott, have you got a prediction? The  Wallabies by how many?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, let’s hope the Wallabies can win. The Kiwis did very well in London. They punched above their  weight. Let’s hope they get their comeuppance on the rugby pitch.

BEN FORDHAM:

Dicky?

RICHARD WILKINS:

Well, Mr Abbott, you’ve had a lot of things to say this morning and probably none more controversial than  that, sir.

BEN FORDHAM:

Mr Wilkins, Mr Abbott, thank you for your time we’ll talk to you soon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Ben. Good on you, Richard!
