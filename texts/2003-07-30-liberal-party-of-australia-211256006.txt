DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT - AMBASSADOR FOR PEOPLE  SMUGGLING ISSUES

I have announced today the appointment of Caroline Millar as Australia’s new Ambassador  for People Smuggling Issues.  Ms Millar replaces John Buckley, who has been Ambassador  since April 2002, with immediate effect.  This appointment reaffirms the Government’s  strong commitment to regional cooperation in combating people smuggling, trafficking in  persons and related transnational crime.

The Ambassador will be responsible for high-level advocacy of Australia's interests in  promoting effective and practical international cooperation to combat people smuggling and  trafficking in persons, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

Ms Millar will promote a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to taking forward the  outcomes of the successful second Regional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling,  Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, held in Bali from 29 to 30 April  2003.

She will work closely with other Governments, notably Indonesia (as co-chair), New Zealand  and Thailand (as coordinators of the two working groups), and with the Office of the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration, to  implement the practical measures agreed to by Ministers at the Conference, including by  promoting regional and international cooperation on these measures between relevant  operational agencies.

Ms Millar is a senior departmental officer, currently First Assistant Secretary, International  Organisations and Legal Division.  She will continue to hold this position concurrently with  her new assignment.  Her other positions in the Department in Canberra have included  Assistant Secretary, Executive, Planning and Evaluation Branch (2001-02); Assistant  Secretary, Trade Policy Issues and Industrials Branch (2000); Director, Non-Proliferation  Policy Section (1992-95); and Executive Officer, Indochina Section (1987-88).  Ms Millar  was also seconded to the Office of National Assessments as Senior Americas Analyst (1991-92).

Overseas, Ms Millar has served as Counsellor, Australian Mission to the United Nations in  New York (1995-1998); First Secretary, Washington (1989-91); and Second Secretary, Hanoi  (1985-87).

A graduate of the University of Cambridge (BA Hons), Ms Millar joined the Department in  1983.  She is married with one child.
