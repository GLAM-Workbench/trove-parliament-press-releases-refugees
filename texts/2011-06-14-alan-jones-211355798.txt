E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

ALAN JONES:

Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Just before I get on to this, I mean when people out there today in struggle street read of an outfit being paid  $4,000 a day to develop and implement a communications strategy, $800,000. I mean, what the hell do they  make of all of this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right. They think this is yet another example of a Government which is all about spin and it’s  not about them and you’re right - if the NBN is a good idea you don’t need these kinds of marketing  campaigns and if it’s a bad idea it shouldn’t be covered up with spin. That’s the point. It is a bad idea, we  don’t need to spend $50 billion-plus on fibre to every home whether it needs it, wants it or is prepared to pay  for it when we’ve got clogged motorways, we’ve got railway systems that aren’t working properly, we’ve  got ports that can’t handle the ships and basically we’ve got hospitals that are falling to pieces around their  patients. So, there are a lot better things to spend the money on, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

You’re right, aren’t you? I mean, if the carbon tax was so obviously correct and the right thing for Australia  well why do you need Cate Blanchett?

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right and you know she’s a terrific actress and I really like watching her in films but when it comes  to tax policy she’s got no more say and should have no more say than the rest of the 22 million of us and I

2



think the reason why we really do need to have an election before we have this tax is because every single  Australian ought to have his or her say and the best way for that is an election, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

The infrastructure, coming back to Nauru, I mean what did you make of all of that? A far better proposition  is it than 10 years ago?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look 10 years ago Nauru was in a very bad way. Their economy was in dire straits, the banks basically  had foreclosed on them and so they really were pretty desperate. Things have improved a lot, their  infrastructure is much better, the power and the water systems are good and can cope. Believe it or not,  Alan, the Nauruan Government has run a fiscal surplus for each of the last three years so in that sense the  Nauruan Government is in much better shape than the Australian Government.

ALAN JONES:

Yeah, well I mean they’re very well credentialed these people. I mean, this is not Hicksville. The Foreign  Minister I understand is a medical graduate from Auckland and Monash universities. These people are no  backwoodsman. I see the President Marcus Stephen said yesterday his Government had received legal  advice which clears the way for Nauru to sign this United Nations Convention on Refugees.

TONY ABBOTT:

And this was always the excuse that the Prime Minister used for not reopening the processing centre in  Nauru, that they weren’t signatories to the UN Convention on Refugees. Now, that was revealed as a bit of a  fraud when she then went to Malaysia with her proposed people swap because Malaysia is not a signatory to  the UN Convention either. But the Prime Minister is running out of excuses with respect to Nauru because  Nauru is about to sign the UN Convention on Refugees and that means that one of the so-called obstacles to  reopening the centre, in fact the last so-called obstacle, has now been removed.

ALAN JONES:

But I mean what a mess. She announces East Timor without talking to the East Timorese. She announces the  reopening of Manus Island without talking to the PNG Government. She announces the five to one  Malaysian people swap before the details are worked out. I notice you’re saying there will be no caning for  boat people in Nauru.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, we went to the almost completed police headquarters in Nauru which is being built in part with  Australian Government funding and they didn’t point out to me a cupboard where the rattan was kept. Look  this is one of the serious problems with sending boat people to Malaysia, the norms of Malaysian justice are  very different to ours. Now, I’m not criticising Malaysia, I think they are entitled to have their standards. But  our standards are our standards and if we expect them to be adhered to we should send boat people to  somewhere like Nauru and not to somewhere like Malaysia.

ALAN JONES:

This is getting worse by the day. I mean, there were stories at the weekend of asylum seekers ganging up on  guards and smashing a roller door to escape their locked compound during a six hour riot at Christmas  Island, that was on Thursday night. A detainee apparently told he wasn’t considered a refugee, he went

3



berserk, that sparked a running battle in which 100 men pelted police and guards with projectiles, Federal  Police in riot gear. I mean, where does this take us?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah and look this is just the latest in a series of disturbances at the Christmas Island centre. There was a  very, very serious riot earlier in the year…

ALAN JONES:

In March, yeah.

TONY ABBOTT:

…where the police virtually had to re-storm the centre to take it back off detainees who had confronted  police in a kind of a pitched battle and the only way to really solve this is to stop the boats. The Howard  Government managed to stop the boats with a number of policies: Nauru, Manus, temporary protection visas  and importantly, Alan, the willingness to turn boats around if it was safe to do so. Now, you’ve got to be  prepared to do all of these things if the boats are going to stop and this is what the Coalition has been urging  on the Government for the best part of 18 months and I think it’s high time that the Government accepted  that its policies haven’t worked and started adopting policies which have been proven to work.

ALAN JONES:

Rejected asylum seekers, though, under the Rudd Government and now the Gillard Government are entitled  to review. These reviews take forever.

TONY ABBOTT:

They do and that just adds to the frustration. Now look, this is the problem. I mean, this is a Government  which is torn between on the one hand wanting to appear tough and on the other hand…

ALAN JONES:

And appease the Greens.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right. I mean, they want to look tough because obviously that’s what the Australian people by and  large expect, but at the same time they’ve got the Greens who are in many ways the real power behind the  Prime Minister and they’ve got their own left wing caucus. So the Prime Minister is in the difficult position  of being like a jockey who is trying to ride four different horses simultaneously.

ALAN JONES:

Now, just finally on Nauru. So, the President has said that they’ve had legal advice - the President of Nauru  Marcus Stephen - which clears the way for Nauru to sign the Convention. So the Nauru option now is clean,  should be on the table and that should be game, set and match?

TONY ABBOTT:

And Alan the thing that really impressed me in Nauru is the deep reservoir of goodwill on the part of the  Nauruan people and government for Australia. Marcus Stephen was asked in the press conference yesterday  ‘are you expecting Australia to pay a price, a high price for this’ and he said ‘look, no we’re not, we’re just

4



happy to help. Australia has been good to us and we know Australia has a problem with boat people and if  we can help Australia out we’re happy to do so.’ So, it really is very gratifying and encouraging to see that  there is a country, albeit a small one, which is so, so keen to help us and I think we should make the most of  that.

ALAN JONES:

Hasn’t yet been alienated by Gillard Government policy. Just a final one before you go, there’s a story today  that you are under internal pressure to abandon this policy of paid parental leave and give the money that’s  been allocated to that to pensioners in the wash up of a carbon tax that comes into place. I mean, I guess  what they are saying is you’d repeal a carbon tax but would you repeal the compensation to pensioners and  the tax cuts for low and middle income households?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, well Alan look first thing is that I think it’s very important to help families and not hurt then and the  paid parental leave scheme helps families, a carbon tax hurts them. Now, we are committed and will remain  committed to a proper paid parental leave scheme.

ALAN JONES:

To interrupt you there, is the Labor Government’s parental leave scheme which started on January 1, $570 a  week for 18 weeks, is that in your definition of proper parental leave scheme?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is it’s an improvement on nothing but no it’s not because in my judgment, Alan, and in the  judgment of the Coalition, parental leave is like other forms of leave, sick leave, holiday leave, personal  leave. It should be paid at someone’s rate of pay, it shouldn’t be just a sort of a welfare measure and that’s  the problem with the Government’s scheme, it’s basically just a rebadged baby bonus.

ALAN JONES:

But given that you’re going to pay it then at the rate of pay and given already $570 is going out your scheme  wouldn’t cost as much as it initially appeared it was going to cost?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s correct, there are offsets.

ALAN JONES:

There are offsets. So, would you see a capacity within that to continue whatever compensation might have  been paid to pensioners if and when this ridiculous carbon tax comes into being?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the best compensation you can give to pensioners is not to have the tax, that’s the thing. Now, we want  to do the right thing by pensioners, Alan, no doubt about that and pensioners can be confident that they will  not be let down by this party. But what I’m not going to do is get into a kind of hypothetical ‘if the  Government does this what will you do next’ because you can’t trust this Government, Alan. You absolutely  can’t trust them. I mean, this is a Prime Minister who said six days before the election ‘there will be no  carbon tax under the government I lead.’ Now, there is going to be a carbon tax. Now she’s trying to say  ‘oh, everything is going to be alright, nothing is really going to change under a carbon tax, you’ll get more

5



back in your pocket than we take out.’ Well, frankly you just can’t believe her and whatever rate the carbon  tax starts at it will just go up and up and up year in year out. The tax will be permanent and increasing, the  compensation if any will be temporary and decreasing.

ALAN JONES:

Ok, good to talk to you and I thank you for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Alan.
