MATT WARDELL:    Well good morning ladies and gentleman, fellow customs  officers, distinguished guests including the Minister for Home  Affairs and the Minister for Justice the Honourable Jason Clare.  The Honourable John Brumby, former premier and treasurer of  Victoria, and the author of the review into anti-dumping  arrangements delivered in 2012. The chief executive officer of  the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Mr  Michael Pezzullo. Deputy chief operating officer for Customs  and Border Protection Ms Marion Grant. Mr Dale Seymour, and  the acting commissioner of the Anti-Dumping Commission Ms  Kim Farrant. My name's Matt Wardell from Customs and Border  Protection.

We're here at the site of the Melbourne office of the Anti-Dumping Commission, a new and dedicated division within  Customs and Border Protection with a reformed a dedicated  focus on efficiently and effectively administering Australia's anti-dumping system.

Before we get any further into today's proceedings, I'd like to  acknowledge the Wurundjeri people, who are the traditional  custodians of the land on which we meet today. I would also like  to pay respect to the elders, both past and present of the  Coolum nations. And, in this NAIDOC Week, where we all  celebrate the history, culture and achievements of Torres  Straight and islander people, I take this opportunity to extend  that respect to all indigenous Australians.

I'd now like to call on the Minister for Home Affairs and the  Minister for Justice, the Honourable Jason Clare, to begin  today's proceedings.

JASON CLARE:       Thanks Matt. Last week the chief executive officer of Customs  and I announced major reforms to customs and border  protection. They're the biggest reforms to customs in decades,  and they include aggressively targeting corruption to weed it out  and stop it coming back, as well as hardening our borders,  making it easier for passengers to move from the aeroplane,  through the customs hall, and onto the train - or get into the taxi  or the car to begin their holiday. It’s also about facilitating trade.

What we're announcing today is an important part of those  reforms. Today we are officially opening the new Australian Anti-Dumping Commission. Customs has been responsible for the  investigation of anti-dumping matters. And dumping is where  something is imported into Australia at less than its real cost -  it's effectively cheating. And it can cost Australians their jobs, it  can hurt Australian businesses, and it can undermine  confidence in free trade. And that's why it's important that we've  got an umpire with the powers and the resources that they need  to make sure that people play by the rules.

Over the course of the last few years we've seen a big increase  in the amount of anti-dumping investigations that we've had to  focus on - a tripling over the last few years. Last year I asked  John Brumby, the former premier of Victoria, to conduct a review  into the best structure to make sure we've got our system set up  to investigate these dumping cases and make sure that people  play by the rules.

John made a number of recommendations. He recommended  we create an anti-dumping commission, he recommended that  we inject more resources to do this work, and he also  recommended that we base the commission here in Melbourne -  the heart of Australia's manufacturing industry. And we've done  all three. We've passed new laws through the Parliament to  establish the commission, we've put more money in the Budget,  and today we're opening the new commission right here in  Melbourne.

In the Budget we've put in an extra $24 million over the next four  years. Now what that will mean that we'll almost double the  amount of resources available to the commission, and almost  double the total number of investigators to do this work. And  recruitment is underway right now for about 25 new staff who  will work here.

Today I can announce that I've formally appointed Mr Dale  Seymour as the head of the Australian Anti-Dumping  Commission. Dale's worked at very high levels in business, and  in government - has enormous experience. We've got Dale  direct from Deloitte Access Economics, he's previously worked  as the president of Wormser Energy in the United States, and as  the deputy secretary of the Department of Business and  Innovation here in Victoria. So he comes to this job with a raft of  experience, and congratulations Dale on your appointment. I  think the team here that are behind the cameras are very  excited to see you here.

In short, this is a big reform. Australia is a trading nation, and we  need to make sure that people have confidence in the system.  In order to have confidence in the system we need to have an  umpire with the powers and the people to make sure that people  play by the rules, and that's why this commission is so important  and why I'm so glad to be here today to officially open the new  commission.

I'll ask Mr Brumby to say a few words. I'll then ask Dale to say a  few words, and then very happy to take all of your questions.

JOHN BRUMBY:      Well thank you very much to Minister Jason Clare, and I'm  delighted to be here today and to add my comments, really, to  the comments that the minister has made.

I was asked to do the review into anti-dumping arrangements  around this time last year. And in the big scheme of things, if  you look at the way that governments work, to be asked to  undertake that review, to complete that review, to make  recommendations, and to be here essentially less than 12  months later, shows, I think, the commitment - the extraordinary  commitment of the minister to getting things done, to getting  things moving, and to make the changes that are required.

There have been a lot of changes made to anti-dumping  arrangements in Australia over recent years. The Minister and  his predecessor have put in place a major reform program, but  the one piece of the jigsaw that hadn't been examined was the  organisational arrangements for anti-dumping within customs in  Australia. And that's what I was asked to examine.

In the course of my work I talked to dozens of Australian  business - locally producing businesses and import business.  We took, literally, hundreds of submissions that came over the  website, I had round tables with industry groups. And from that I  produced the report which I presented to the minister last year in  November.

The thing that came through most strongly to me was that for  Australia as a trading nation and an exporting nation, Australian  businesses need to have confidence in their anti-dumping  arrangements. And the other thing that came through very  strongly is that in recent years there has been a huge increase  in the number of goods, the types of goods, dumped into the  Australian market.

And we are an attractive market. There are not many places in  the world where you've got cities the size of Melbourne and  Sydney with good ports where there are goods travelling around  the world, looking for a home, we are an attractive market. And  so change was necessary and I recommended a number of  measures for the Government to consider and I'm delighted that  all of those have been embraced by the Government and they're  being implemented here today.

More resources, because there had been increase in workload.  A new organisation, a better focused organisation, still within  Customs, but Anti-Dumping Commission with new leadership  reporting directly to the Minister. Those things I think are  important. And I also recommended a significant increase in  resources and the Government has provided something like $24  million extra over the forward estimates period, which means  that we can invest in more people, more staff, and more skills to  get the job done more quickly. And that's what business wants.

So I think this is an exciting day. You know, it's - you've got to go  back to the 1990s really for the last time there was a review of  these organisational arrangements, but the way in which the  Anti-Dumping Commission and governments manage this issue  of dumping is important to our economy, it's important to  manufacturers, it's important to our faith and confidence in an  open trading system.

And what people want is certainty, they want strong leadership,  they want confidence in the system, and I believe that the  recommendations I made will produce that and I am delighted  that the Minister and the Federal Government have found the  commitment, the will, and the resource to do that and to do that  so quickly. So I think it's a very positive day.

JASON CLARE:       Thanks very much, John, and Dale, congratulations on your  appointment as the Anti-Dumping Commissioner. Well done and  invite you to say a few words.

DALE SEYMOUR:   Just a few words. I'm very, very honoured indeed to accept the  Minister's offer of appointment as Australia Anti-Dumping  Commissioner. The task for the commission now is to deliver the  outcomes that recognise the importance to our economy in

terms of fair economic competition, investment in jobs, of act of  anti-dumping jurisdiction for Australia. That's my task as the  Commissioner and I intend to pursue that with vigour. So thank  you very much.

JASON CLARE:       Okay. Very happy to take your questions.

QUESTION:              [Inaudible question]

JASON CLARE:       We’ve put through over the course of the last 18 months six  tranches of legislative reform through the parliament. The last of  those bills went through the parliament only in the last few  weeks. They form part of a package of reforms that my  predecessor, Brendan O'Connor, announced about 18 months  or so ago that make sure that we've got the right legislative  structure to investigate anti-dumping cases, supported by an  expert panel that can provide with advice where legislative  change is needed in the future. That's the key. That's what  we've done there. All of those reforms, I should say, are all  compliant with the WTO rules.

One of the big challenges we've found that existed here though  was that the number of investigations had tripled and the team  to do that investigation hadn't increased. So we needed an  organisation that was focused on this, we needed the resources,  the people to do those investigations, and that's why we're  almost doubling the number of investigators. And John made the  point, and I think he's right, that we need to base the  commission where a lot of the work is, the heart of Australia's  manufacturing industry, here in Melbourne.

QUESTION:              Some commentators have said that dumping is actually good  for the consumers and for the economy. [Inaudible]

JASON CLARE:       What’s good for Australia, what's good for the world, is when  people play by the rules, and it's important that companies  overseas and companies in Australia know what the rules are  and play by them. And in order to make sure that everybody  plays by the rules, you've got to have an umpire that has the  people and has the powers to do that job. That's what the  establishment of this commission will ensure.

QUESTION:              But how effective can it be when there are no international rules  that back it up and the World Trade Organisation doesn't have  rules in this?

JASON CLARE:       Well, you've got WTO rules that all countries of the world need  to comply with. The laws we've put in place over the course of  the last 12 to 18 months are WTO compliant.

QUESTION:              Minister, do you have any estimation of how much dumping  costs [inaudible]?

JASON CLARE:       I don't have a figure off the top of my head. John might have got  one over the course of his investigation. The point I made earlier  is that where companies dump goods into Australia, it can cost  Australians jobs. Where dumping happens, Australians can lose  their jobs and companies can go under, and that's not on. We've  got to make sure that where dumping occurs, it's investigated  and stopped, otherwise it hurts the Australian economy, hurts  Australian jobs, that's why we need a strong Anti-Dumping  Commission.

QUESTION:              Which industries does it affect the most?

JASON CLARE:       It is a range of industries. In recent times, we've seen  investigations into the building industry. Steel, aluminium,  timber. But we've also seen dumping happen with food products.  We've got an investigation which kicks off today into peaches  imported from South Africa and tomatoes imported from Italy. So  dumping can happen in a number of different industries and  from different countries around the world.

QUESTION:              Minister, just on another matter, Alcoa have announced their  yearly results today and - or yesterday. There's talk that the  smelters might close in Australia. You've also got Holden, who is  wanting more government assistance. What is your stance on  further government assistance for companies that have already  received it?

JASON CLARE:       Well, this sits a little outside my portfolio. I'll ask you to refer that  question to my colleague, Kim Carr.

QUESTION:              But do you have a stance at all on the Government propping up  companies?

JASON CLARE:       Well, the general point I would make is the point that the Prime  Minister made last week, which is this is a government which  wants to make sure that Australia makes things and support  Australian industry. An Anti-Dumping Commission is not about  protecting Australian industry, it's about making sure that  everybody plays off the same rules of the same song sheet.

QUESTION:              And how about in regards to the Prime Minister's changes to  the way the Labor Party elects its leader. Are you supportive of  these changes despite unions harking up and saying they don't  want them?



JASON CLARE:       I think these are important reforms. They're big reforms. They  mean that somebody joins the Labor Party, they'll get to vote on

who they think the leader of the Labor Party should be. They  mean that when somebody is elected Prime Minister, that  person is Prime Minister for the term - the next term of  government. So they're big reforms, they're important reforms,  they'll be welcomed by all members of the Labor Party. People  who are members of unions, I'd encourage to join the Labor  Party and they'll get a vote in determining who the leader of the  Labor Party is.

QUESTION:              Are you concerned that unions may withhold funding,  particularly from this upcoming election, given that they are  pretty unhappy about these changes?

JASON CLARE:       I'm not sure if I agree that unions are unhappy with this. This  doesn't change the powers that unions have inside the Labor  Party, what it does is it increases the powers of members of the  Labor Party.

The point I'd make is that it increases the powers for members  of the Labor Party, that's a good thing, its democratising the  Labor Party, it's giving more power to people who want to be  members of the Labor Party, and I think it's a reform that's long  overdue and I congratulate Kevin Rudd for putting it in.

QUESTION:              Mr Brumby, can I ask you your opinion on the party reforms  [indistinct]?

JOHN BRUMBY:      Well, you can ask me but I won't answer it.

QUESTION:              Are you satisfied with the reforms?

JOHN BRUMBY:      No, well you can ask me, but I'm chairman of the COAG reform  council and it's probably not appropriate that I comment about  internal party matters. Thank you for your question.

QUESTION:              How about in terms of [indistinct] holding you were the premier  of this state, and they're quite influential businesses in the state.  Is it important to continue assistance to them because they are  threatening to [indistinct] operations [indistinct]?

JOHN BRUMBY:      Well again, I think they're questions for federal government and  state government, both levels of government - and it is important  that Australia continues to manufacture things and to make  things. And I think, you know, the announcement today just to  be clear about it, is an important part of that set of  arrangements. So what we're announcing today is not about  artificial barriers or protection, but it's about making sure that we  apply the rules and apply them well and apply them  expeditiously. And that's what the Minister's done, with all of the

reforms and the additional resources. And that's what industry  needs and industry wants.

So whether you're an SPC Ardmona in relation to peaches or  tomatoes, or whether you're a company in relation to steel or  aluminium, you want to know that if you believe goods are being  dumped into the Australian market at below their real cost of  production, that you can come to the Anti-Dumping Commission  and your case will be heard fairly and efficiently and  expeditiously so that you can get some certainty in the way in  which you run your operations.

So this is a small but nevertheless important part of the  framework for doing business in Australia. And the rest of it, of  course, is going to go to the settings about the national  economy, about skills, about education, about taxation, about all  of the other things that go to make the setting for international  business. But, you know, it is important that we continue to  make things, it's particularly important for Victoria, and one of  the reasons why I recommended that the Commission be based  here in Victoria is because it is the home of manufacturing in  Australia.

QUESTION:              Mr Brumby, you mentioned the number of investigations have  tripled in recent years, do you know what's led to that?

JOHN BRUMBY:      Well, there'd be a range of factors. But I think probably three  principal factors. Firstly, the global financial crisis, so it's literally  true to say that across the world you've had many large  businesses, and countries, producing more goods than the  world can buy at regular prices, so you have literally had  shiploads of goods moving around the world looking for a  market. So there's been over production. So, they've been  cutting prices below the cost, so that's factor number one.

Factor number two is, as I said before, Melbourne and Sydney  and Brisbane are very attractive markets in the global sense.  You know, you put together cities of three, four, five million  people, good ports, easy to get to, big markets within four  kilometres of the port, you're a very attractive location.

And the third one is obviously the value of the dollar, which has  been until recently at above parity. You put all of those things  together, and you get a combination of factors which makes us  very attractive for seeing goods dumped into our market. And  again I think the policy response that the Minister has made is  absolutely appropriate, and very timely.

QUESTION:              Mr Brumby, will you be joining Steve Bracks and Simon Crean  in writing to local members of Hotham in regard to promoting  Geoff Lake's appointment to the seat?

JOHN BRUMBY:      No I won't be, no. And not because I don't know Geoff Lake, but  I'm not taking sides.

QUESTION:              Minister Clare, can I just ask what you know, or what you've  been told about the asylum seekers who have currently jumped  overboard?

JASON CLARE:       I don't have any specific detail about that at the moment. But  more generally the point that I would make is that this is the sort  of thing that happens when you try and push a boat back out to  sea, and worse. We should be very clear about this, people  smugglers aren't stupid. When they see a navy vessel coming, if  they think they're going to be pushed back or towed back to  Indonesia, they'll sabotage the boat, the boat will sink, people  will jump into the water. Our officers, our sailors, will have to  jump in to rescue them and it puts their lives at risk, it puts  everyone's life at risk.

We should be pretty clear about this. You can't push a boat back  to Indonesia if it's at the bottom of the ocean. And you can't tow  a boat back to Indonesia if Indonesia says no, and that's what  the Indonesian Government has said.

Now, what does all of this mean? It means that Tony Abbott's  policy is in tatters. He says he'll stop the boats, but the next  question is how? And he has no answer to that.

QUESTION:              What do you make of Scott Morrison's comments this week  about sending in the SAS if asylum seekers are threatening self  harm on boats?

JASON CLARE:       Well I think I answered this question earlier on. The prospect of  sending Special Forces soldiers within 40 nautical miles of the  Indonesian coast, I think beggars belief in itself. But I have made  the point before, and I'll make the point again that these  decisions are made by officers not made by politicians sitting in  an armchair in Canberra.

QUESTION:              I'm just wondering if Mr Pezzullo might be able to answer some  questions. Is Customs hearing that asylum seekers are resorting  to self-harm?

MICHAEL PEZZULLO:       Sorry, in what specific circumstance?

QUESTION:              When Customs has been involved, when you're intercepting  any boats, and had reports that asylum seekers are threatening  self-harm?

MICHAEL PEZZULLO:       If you're referring to the recent incident where a merchant  vessel rescued some people at sea and - in that case it is  alleged that some of them threatened to harm  themselves, or indeed harm other persons, I haven't seen  a full report on that, no.

QUESTION:                          And do you think there needs to be some sort of  intervention from the military, or otherwise?

MICHAEL PEZZULLO:       Look, our job - the Customs and Border Protection  Service, working with the Australian Defence Force  through the joint operation that we have known as the  Border Protection Command - our job is to apply the  policies of the Government of the day within the law, and  to apply the laws of Australia, and we do it.

JASON CLARE:                   Alright, terrific. Thanks very much.
