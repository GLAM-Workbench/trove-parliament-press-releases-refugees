Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania

Government Immigration Shemozzle

3rd Mar 05

The Howard Government’s failure to adequately fund public  education including TAFE has left Australia short of skilled workers,  Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

“The Howard policy of diversion of funding to private education  rather than catering for plumbers, electricians and welders has  failed,” Senator Brown said.

“The first place Amanda Vanstone should look for skilled workers is  amongst the thousands of men and women holding temporary  protection visas who desperately want to contribute to this nation.

“Australia’s immigration policy is a costly shemozzle,” Senator  Brown said.
