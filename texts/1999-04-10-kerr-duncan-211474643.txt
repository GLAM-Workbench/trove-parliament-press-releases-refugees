Australia’s front line border patrol, first 
Newsagent, now Green keeper

Â

“The shocking reports of 10 0 illegal immigrants fleeing into 
New South Wales bushland, only one month after 26 boat people arrived 
on a Cairns suburban beach is of concern to all Australians,” Shadow 
Minister for Justice and Customs, Duncan Kerr said today.

Â

“At Cairns it was a newsagent who was the first 
to inform Customs of the boat people’s arrival, today it was a greenkeeper 
from the Scotts Head Bowling Club on the coast of

NSW.

Â

“Labor is angry that yet another near farcical incident 
like this could occur. This second incident will now confirm the nation 
as a laughing stock when it comes to border patrol.

Â

“Justice and Customs Minister, Amanda Vanstone is 
obviously out of her depth presiding over yet another security breach 
of this magnitude.

Â

“The Minister’s knee jerk reaction when the last 
boat arrived was to call for an inquiry. Clearly this time that is not 
enough.

Â

“Amanda Vanstone already knew the problems in her 
Department, she has had on her desk for months a high level inter-departmental 
investigation into Coastwatch and a recommendation to streamline protocols 
between Coastwatch and its client departments.

Â

“Australians need to be confident of their national 
security. Anther inquiry will not do, the Minister must take action 
and improve the surveillance of our national coastline.

Â

Mr Kerr called for a major shake of Customs and in 
particular Coastwatch.

Â

“There must be a guarantee that coordination between 
Customs, the Australian Federal Police and the defence forces will actually 
occur,” Mr Kerr said.
