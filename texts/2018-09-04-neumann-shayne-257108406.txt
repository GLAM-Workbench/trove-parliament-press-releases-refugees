DUTTON HAS NO EXCUSES TO REFUSE NEW ZEALAND’S OFFER TO

RESETTLE REFUGEES



Peter Dutton and the out-of-touch Morrison Government have no excuses when it

comes to refusing the generous offer from New Zealand to resettle eligible

refugees and children from Manus and Nauru.



At the Pacific Islands Forum on Nauru, New Zealand has confirmed that they

would be willing to negotiate conditions to negate any concerns Peter Dutton and

the Liberals may have.



“If the issue was that was their (Australia’s) concern by letting them come to NZ

they will gain right to Australia, we can fix that up so that’s not really a concern in

my view.”



New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Winston

Peters

Labor has written to both Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison urging them to accept

New Zealand's offer so that eligible refugees, including children, from Manus and



Nauru can be resettled as quickly as possible.



If the Turnbull Government was able to negotiate appropriate conditions for the US

refugee resettlement agreement to prevent people smugglers exploiting vulnerable

people, the Morrison Government should be able to negotiate similar conditions for

any deal with New Zealand.



The New Zealand offer was first negotiated in 2013 between former Prime Minister

Gillard and former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key - before being shelved

by Tony Abbott who said it would only be called upon “if and when it becomes

necessary”.



Nauru and Manus Island were set up as temporary regional processing centres but

have become places of indefinite detention because of the failure of successive

Liberal Government’s to negotiate other third country resettlement options.



The embattled Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton needs to immediately do his job

and accept New Zealand’s offer.



If Peter Dutton is incapable of negotiating conditions on a deal with New Zealand -

or he’s too distracted by his ministerial intervention drama - Scott Morrison needs

to step in and take action to end the indefinite detention of refugees.
