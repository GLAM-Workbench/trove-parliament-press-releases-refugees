SIMON BEAUMONT:

Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Simon.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

What did you say to her in parliament yesterday?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, ‘congratulations’, and she told me ‘game on’, so it was light but it was  businesslike. I mean, she’s a formidable politician, she’s harnessed the faceless men  to rally to the top job and, you know, she’ll be a tough opponent.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

You obviously respect her. Will she be a tougher opponent that Kevin Rudd?

TONY ABBOTT:

She’s a formidable politician but I think the Labor brand has suffered very serious  damage because of the midnight knock on the door execution which has exposed the  ugly underbelly of Labor and I think a lot of people right around the country who may  not have been great fans of Kevin Rudd are just recoiling in horror at the way a Prime  Minister elected by the people has been executed by the factions.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Malcolm Turnbull might say the same thing about you.

TONY ABBOTT:

The big difference is that Labor Members of Parliament were frogmarched by union  leaders and factional heavies towards this decision. I mean, even as late as  Wednesday night there were lots of Labor Members of Parliament, backbenchers,  who didn’t know what was going on, and as I said, they were frogmarched in to turf  out the leader they were mostly happy enough with and put someone else in. The  other big difference, Simon, is that the issue that we had last December was about  policy. Now, there’s no policy difference between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. She  made as much clear herself yesterday, she said it was the way it was being sold not  any fundamental difference and they’ve changed the leader but it’s still the same  policies; still the same government and if you want to change the policies you’re  going to have to change the government.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

You are known to be proactive, aggressive if you like, combative in parliament. Will  you go easier on Julia Gillard because she is a woman?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that my job is the same today as it was a week ago and I’ve got to expose the  flaws in what the Government is doing and I’ve got to be a credible alternative and  there are three tests for Julia Gillard. Will she stop the boats? I don’t think she can.  Will she end the school hall rip-off? She was the author of it. I don’t think she’s going  to stop it. I think the $5.5 billion still to go out the door will go out the door and  largely be wasted. And third and most importantly, will she stop the mining tax  debacle, and as long as she’s got the $12 billion of revenue in the Budget I think every  miner needs to understand that she’s not operating in good faith.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Well, it’s only day one. That line in the budget may well go. It takes away one of the  weapons in your armoury, doesn’t it? She set up a negotiating team, she’s spoken  about that this morning in Canberra…

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s the same people, Simon. I mean, the same people are in her negotiating team,  Wayne Swan and Martin Ferguson, that were in Kevin Rudd’s negotiating team.  Now, unless they are told that everything’s on the table, particularly retrospectivity,  particularly the rates of tax, what’s the difference? What’s the point?

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Well it may mean… if we take her at face value and a new negotiation begins, it  means that you can no longer use that phrase ‘great big new tax’ doesn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

But we have got to see the outcome and, you see, what she wants to do is to string  people along until after the election and then this tax is going to be imposed in all its

force. You see, she’s the co-author of this tax. It came out of the gang of four of  which she was a leading member and if this tax was such a bad thing as formulated  originally, why didn’t she know this 50-odd days ago when the thing was first  announced?

SIMON BEAUMONT:

The other big issue which we know from programmes like ours and you guys do your  own internal polling as well, is asylum seekers, immigration policy, border protection.  Can you clarify for our listeners today, if elected, what you will change with border  protection?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve always said that four things are needed to stop the boats and no one of these  things is sufficient but together I think all four of them will make a big, big difference.  First, we’ve got to have rigorous offshore processing and Labor’s not doing that any  more. Second, we’ve got to have a temporary protection visa. Labor won’t do that.  Third, we’ve got to have better relations with source and transit countries and  certainly Kevin Rudd mismanaged those. Fourth, where possible you’ve got to be  prepared to turn boats around and I don’t think that the new Government will have the  guts to do that either. So, that’s what’s needed.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Will you look at closing down these centres? You know, we could be talking six,  eight months and you could potentially be prime minister, would you look at closing  down Leonora and Darwin?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you’ve got to stop the boats. That’s the thing and the only way to stop the boats  is to make the changes that I’ve just outlined and which Julia Gillard won’t be able to  make and Kevin Rudd wasn’t able to make.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Just one final one from me. You enjoy an occasionally flirtatious relationship with  Julia Gillard, particularly on breakfast television…

TONY ABBOTT:

And, you know, she’s squibbed it, Simon.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Will that stop?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, yes it will stop because she today unilaterally ended those appearances. It’s  interesting, she was happy to go on Channel Nine to popularise herself to get the top  job but now that she’s got it she’s squibbing any further debates, which I think is  really sad. I mean, here’s someone who claims to believe in accountability and open  government. Why shouldn’t there be a national debate between the Prime Minister  and the alternative prime minister on television every Friday morning and she’s  squibbed it.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Alright, good to talk to you today, just one final one. Is it a good thing or a bad thing  that you’re up against Julia Gillard now, for you?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s just a fact of life. I mean, there will always be a prime minister and there will  always be an opposition leader and I’m the opposition leader and she’s the prime  minister and essentially my job is the same today as it was a week ago.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Thanks for talking to our listeners today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Simon.
