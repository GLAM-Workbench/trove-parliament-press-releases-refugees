JOE HOCKEY:

I just can’t believe that a senior minister in the Government is treating the concerns of  people in the community about the carbon tax as a joke. The way Craig Emerson behaved  yesterday was a disgrace and it just reflects the attitude of the Gillard Government to the  concerns of every day Australians about the carbon tax. I am here with Craig Laundy - this  is, at the moment, a Labor Party seat. This has, in the past, been Labor Party heartland but  it is the Labor Party that is treating their own heartland with contempt. These are the people  that are reaching out to the Coalition to get rid of the carbon tax and get some confidence  back with consumers, to get some confidence back into business. Every business we have  been to today, along with the businesses yesterday that I visited, are all saying they haven't  been told yet by the electricity companies, or by the refrigerant companies, what the impact  is of the carbon tax. That uncertainty is part of the formula that the Government is leaving  behind. Sooner or later this Government is going to realise that the carbon tax is just a  damn bad idea and it has been a disaster for consumers and it has been terrible for  business. This is not the way to run a country, to have a circus clown as Trade Minister, to  have a Prime Minister that is indifferent to the concerns of every day Australians and to  introduce a tax that is not going to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions. It is simply  going to make life all the more painful for everyday Australians. Craig, do you want to say  something?

CRAIG LAUNDY, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR REID:

Firstly, thank you to Joe for coming here today. Welcome to Reid. My name is Craig  Laundy, I am the candidate running here at the next federal election. I am not a politician, I  am from Reid. The people you have seen today in the shops are people I rub shoulders  with day in, day out. My motivation, as a lifetime resident of this community, is to give Joe  and his team a hand to end what I think is the worst Government Australia has ever had.  The No.1 priority should - and will be - repealing the carbon tax. It is an honour to hopefully  be a part of the team to help Joe do that. The one thing I can say if I do get there is I didn't  vote for the carbon tax, I voted against it, and I am proud of that to give these businesses a  hand. If these people lose their business, they lose their home. They employ people. They  are the centrepiece of this strip shopping centre in Homebush but in every suburb through  Reid you see the same. Joe, thanks for coming, keep up the fight and we're here to give  you a hand as best we can.

JOURNALIST:

Joe Hockey, how are you going to go about repealing the carbon tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

On day one of the first parliamentary sitting after the next election we will introduce  legislation to repeal the carbon tax. We expect the Labor Party in the wake of, hopefully, an

electoral thrashing will understand that the will of the people cannot be denied. The will of  the people is to get rid of a bad tax, and to get rid of a bad Government.

JOURNALIST:

You said you will keep the family payments going, where will you make the savings to do  that?

JOE HOCKEY:

We haven’t said yet that the compensation formula is going to be the same. We will have  more to say about that before the next election. I say that to you because we need to know  what the timing is in order to address the budget issues. At the moment it is still, God forbid,

another year until the next election but I think you can tell by speaking to anyone - pick  them randomly around here, in the middle of a Labor seat, pick them randomly - and ask  them whether they want to have an election to get on with getting rid of a bad Government.

JOURNALIST:

So payments could be reduced then?

JOE HOCKEY:

We are not giving any indication yet until we see the state of the budget at the time the  election is called and then everyone will see our plan before the next election.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Hockey, we were here on Friday and priced items at a number of stores including the  IGA you walked into and the Foodworks around the corner. I have spoken to this grocer  and the butcher behind you. Nobody has increased their prices yet.

JOE HOCKEY:

That is right. As you have just heard, they haven't got their bills yet. That is the thing. As I  said to you a little bit earlier…

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] and he says he is not going to.

JOE HOCKEY:

As I said previously, these guys haven't got their bills from the electricity companies for the  increased costs associated with doing business. Therefore the increases haven't flowed  through yet but they will. That is why we have been saying repeatedly, this is a slow burn  tax. It is an embedded tax. It is embedded in the repairs of refrigerators but only when you  have to repair the refrigerators and in the gases when you have to regas your refrigerators  and freezers. It is embedded in the cost of transport when that flows through and it will be  embedded in electricity prices and embedded in the prices of everyday goods when the  electricity companies pass it on in the next bill. That may be, for those people on monthly  bills, at the end of the month. It could be quarterly, a lot of businesses are on quarterly  plans - one of the businesses down the road showed me their bill that was quarterly - as I  understand it. It will flow through and that is when they have to increase their prices.

JOURNALIST:

There is genuine concern about refrigeration. How much of an impact do you think that will  have?

JOE HOCKEY:

It just adds to the cost. This is an embedded tax. The more energy you use in your  everyday life, the more manufactured the good you sell, then the higher the carbon tax  component. It is a tax on energy and therefore wherever there is manufacturing and  wherever there is logistics and distribution the tax will be greater than if you're running a  sheep in a paddock. That is the simple fact, that is why it is such an insidious tax.

JOURNALIST:

Are you expecting a lot of small businesses to close?

JOE HOCKEY:

I hope not. I truly hope not. I hope no business closes because of the carbon tax. We give  them hope that if we're elected it will be going.

JOURNALIST:

But there is no real help or information to help small businesses. [inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

There is nothing. There is nothing. Julia Gillard, Wayne Swan and Greg Combet can run  around the country talking about how they're giving $60 million or $40 million to an  aluminium smelter there. The bottom line is for the businesses right here in your every day  suburb there is not a dollar of compensation for the carbon tax yet they're going to have to  find a way to pay it. That is the most insidious aspect of it. The government says trade  exposed industries will pay a lot less. I will tell you what trade exposed industries are, the  small business operators on the Great Barrier Reef and the tourism industry or a range of  others who are involved in exporting services or exporting goods overseas and they are  small businesses and they're not getting any compensation.

JOURNALIST:

You said you are going to introduce legislation to repeal the carbon tax. Is that a bit of a  song and a dance in itself [inaudible]?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. I think it will pass. I think Labor will be mugged by the reality of a significant election  defeat, therefore, they will facilitate the passage of the carbon tax repeal through the  Parliament. Let me tell you, when we facilitated the passage of the repeal of WorkChoices  through the Parliament, we did so because we recognised that the Australian people spoke  at the last election (2007). Therefore, WorkChoices is dead. If the Labor Party is ever going  to think of one day, getting back into Government, they will have to understand that the  electorate will not listen to them until they listen to the electorate. Therefore they will  facilitate the passage of the repeal of the carbon tax should they go into Opposition.

JOURNALIST:

You mentioned Craig Emerson's antics yesterday. Weren't they just an innocent media  stunt?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. I can't believe this guy is the Minister for Trade for Australia. Seriously, this is a  Government that is dysfunctional. It is a Government that is in its own parallel universe to  that that everyday Australians live. I am appalled at the behaviour of Craig Emerson. You  look at the outrage about Mary-Jo Fisher's behaviour in Parliament and when she did a bit  of a performance and now you know why. I just wonder. I don't know how to explain it.

JOURNALIST:

Are you [inaudible]?

JOE HOCKEY:

I just can't believe we're in a situation where Australia's Minister for Trade is behaving like  that. That is what I am saying. I just can’t believe it. This guy is meant to be our  representative on the international scene and he's treating as a joke the concerns of  everyday Australians about something that he has done.

JOURNALIST:

Would you like the Prime Minister to reprimand him?

JOE HOCKEY:

I can't believe he's still on the front bench.

JOURNALIST:

The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, is in Darwin today speaking to the Indonesian President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Will you be hoping for some kind of outcome on asylum  seekers?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely. Indonesia has to be a partner in addressing the asylum seeker issue. They're  not our enemy. They're our friend, they are our mate and we need their help in addressing  this issue. Julia Gillard needs to forge an agreement with the President of Indonesia that  ensures that the boats stop. The way Kevin Rudd treated the Indonesians ensured that we  weren't going to have that sort of agreement and Julia Gillard promising to put a detention  centre in East Timor without consulting the Government of East Timor proves that her  diplomatic skills leave something to be desired.

JOURNALIST:

Will the Coalition then be engaging with the multiparty committee on asylum seekers that  she is setting up?

JOE HOCKEY:

We will certainly be speaking to the expert committee. We will speak to them but, frankly, it  is about time that Julia Gillard showed some leadership skills rather than contracting  responsibility for governing the country out to an expert committee or giving an excuse that

someone else is responsible for a problem. She's the Prime Minister, she really wanted the

job. She knifed Kevin Rudd to get there and now she doesn't know how to handle it.  Thanks.
