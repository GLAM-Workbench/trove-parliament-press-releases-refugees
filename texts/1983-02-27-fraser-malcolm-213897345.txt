ELECTORATE TALK

We are in the last days of a very important election compaign. I want to talk to you tonight about some issues that  are fundamental* to the choree to be made on March 5. The impact  of the drought, the severe world recession and irresponsible  wage demands have made recent years difficult, yet your Government

has responded with strength and determination.

We have a record of positive achievement across every front. We have achieved new strengths in our alliances and our  position in the world. We have achieved reforms by cutting  taxes, substantially increasing family allowances and

providing significant rebates on home loan repayments.  Recently  we have embarked upon two major projects - a Bicentennial Roads  Programme and a National Water Resources Programme, part of our  vision ,  of achievement for Australia.

A recent achievement has been to put in.place the wages  pause. Our arguments persuaded all eight Governments to support  it. Only Federal Labor and their ACTU masters opposed this  programme, which will lead not only to economic recovery but also

free $300 million to provide jobs for young Australians, the  older unemployed and welfare housing.

We are a Government not only of achievement but of promise. We have promised a new deal for young Australians, with jobs  especially in conservation projects. Lower tax rates, more  finance and help with advanced technology promise a bright

future for small business, new child care programmes and  expansion in pensioner health benefits promise more security for  families.

We promise major reforms in industrial relations.  Secret  ballots and reforms to strikes in essential services,  promise security and sanity, especially compared with Labor’s  pledges of more power to the unions.  My Government has a record

of achievement - a commitment to the future based upon this.

In difficult times Australians have always been prepared to face  u p  to.making tough and difficult decisions- Thpy know there

are ho quick,and easy solutions.  Ã¢ÂÂ   :  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

We know we cannot overcome this  problem by a simple, crude policy of spend, spend, spend. Yet  that is precisely what Labor is determined to do.

In order to get that money they will have to compete with you  for funds. The money you need to build or buy your own home,   to develop your small business and increase employment would go  instead to Labor. The money which our dymanic industries  need to expand, to compete, to create jobs - it would go instead  Labor. '

In addition to depriving you of fuhds, .

in order to find 4,000 million dollars more than is already being  spent, Labor policies will mean much higher interest rates on  what money is left - higher interest rates on your home loan,  higher interest rates which will prevent industry from growing

and employing more people, higher interest rates which will hurt  all Australians,

We will not let that happen, We will make sure that money is available  not for big-spending governments, but for big-thinking Australians. 1

The disaster of Labor's policies is so much worse when you look  at Labor's deal with the unions. Most Australians agree that  the unions already have too much power. For selfish and often  irresponsible ends unions continually disrupt the lives of decent  Australians paralysing transport systems, drying up petrol

supplies, costing you money, costing Australia jobs.

Yet on March 5 the former head of the A.C.T.U. is asking you  to vote for more union power. The so-called prices and incomes  deal dictated by the unions and accepted by the Labor Party must  be exposed. This shameful deal gives the unions a power of veto  over the policies of a Labor Government. Labor Government  policies must be agreed to by the unions - that's what the deal

says. It means Labor would provide "policies to suit the unions  regardless of what's best for you. This deal commits

Labor, in their own words, to being "accommodating and supportive"  of the unions. That means no less than a Labor Government  accommodating - agreeing to union demands and being supportive  of the unions even when they ought to be supportive of you, the  people of Australia who are the constant victims of union militancy.

This deal_  provides a blueprint for socialist control of Australia.  Every business big or small is to be regulated. They say *

"comprehensive" and "closely monitored" interventionist policies  are necessary to achieve "a transition of thÂ« economy into a  planned framework". Â·  .  . . .

The lives and incomes- in their words of shoj^eep^rs ,  SelfÂ· 'i;'.  employed builders and tradesmen are to be c<3tt. t r d l l # Â» d . ÃÂ  .   Government and unions unde| this deal will eryian be given the right  to set profit levels. As If this were not enough, the deal gives,  unions this same right of veto over policies for your health  care, over your children's education, over pensions and t,

superannuation and over immigration, which was a particular  target of the last Labor government.

But most despicable of all, this deal leaves no room for you to  really influence your own future. It is an exclusive deal  between Labor and militant unions, a deal in which you have no  say.

My government will never permit this to happen. We propose to  bring the militant unions back under the control of the law,  responsible to their own members and to the people - all the  people - of Australia. Â·

On March 5 you will have a choice - you can elect the men and women  who will actually govern Australia, or you can elect a party which  will be the instrument of militant unions. Australians don't  want union dominance and socialist control. They want the

freedom to work, to strive, to succeed, to prosper, to be  rewarded for effort. We will provide a government which values  those endeavours and which seeks to promote the talents of a  great people in a free society.
