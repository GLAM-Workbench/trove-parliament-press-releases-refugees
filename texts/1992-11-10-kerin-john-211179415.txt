Australian relief aid worth more than $15m for Horn of Africa

Australia will provide emergency aid worth more than $15 million for people  affected by drought and conflict in the Hom of Africa, the Minister for Trade and  Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

"The package includes $10m for Australian wheat, wheat flour, high energy  biscuits, cooking oil, beans and associated transport costs. Health and agricultural  programs will also receive support," Mr Kerin said.

"Our aid will be distributed by Australian non government organisations and  United Nations agencies working in the Hom of Africa."

"Civil conflicts and ethnic rivalries in the region have escalated, particularly in  southern Sudan. The situation has been aggravated by worsening drought  which is spreading to cover most of eastern and southern Africa," Mr Kerin said.

"People have continued to flee across national boundaries, creating further  problems for the relief effort because of lack of security and difficulties in gaining  access to different groups.

"The United Nations has stressed the importance of taking a regional approach  whilst bearing in mind the specific needs of individual countries."
