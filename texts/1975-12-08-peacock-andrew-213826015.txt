PORTUGUESE TIMOR

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Andrew  Peacock,  said today that the Government was continually watching  the development of events in Portuguese Timor. — Â·  Â·  ...

Mr Peacock recalled that the tragedy of Portuguese  Timor had really begun with the intense political difficulties  which Portugual had experienced over recent months. This had  led to the fact that successive Portuguese Governments had been'  unable to exercise sufficient influence in Portuguese Timor with

the result that the Macau program for decolonisation had broken  down. This had in turn precipitated a situation of disorder in  the territory, leading, among other things, to the flight of  some 40,000 refugees across the border into Indonesian Timor. This sudden and large influx of refugees had caused the

Indonesian Government great difficulties. Conflict betv/een the  Ã¢ÂÂ   various political groups in the territory had begun simultaneously  and fighting had gone on intermittently over the past few weeks,  This had led to the recent unilateral declaration of independence

by the FRETILIN party,  a declaration which had been followed by  a declaration by other political groups that Portuguese Timor  was a part of Indonesia. The whole situation had culminated in  the attack upon and capture of DiliÂ·. -

Indonesia's stated objective, Mr Peacock continued,  was the restoration of law and order, a task which Portugual  had been unable to carry out,  as a necessary pre-condition to  a proper expression by the Timorese people of theiÂ£ own wishes

regarding their political future. While this objective was  laudable, the means chosen by Indonesia to achieve it was a  matter for deep regret and concern on the part of the Australian  Government. On a number of occasions in the past, the Australian  Ambassador in Jakarta had been instructed to point out -to the  Indonesian Government that the use of force was not an appropriate  means to settle the problem of Portuguese Timor. The last jpccasion  on which the Ambassador had made this point to the Indonesian  authorities had been on 4 December 1975. The Australian Government  uid. not condone the attack upon Dild _ which had just taken place.

"We do not regard the use of force as an appropriate means of  solving international problems",  he said-

The Australian Government, Mr Peacock continued, had  just learned that Portugal intended to complain to.the Security  Council of the United Nations about Indonesia's action over  Portuguese Timor, The Government understood that the Security '   Council was likely to meet during the course of this week to  discuss the question. The Australian Government would seek to  be represented when the Security Council met for this purpose.

Its representative there would press for a call by the Security  Council for an immediate cease-fire - "as indeed we do now". Its  representative would also express the strong view that the  Timorese people should have the opportunity to exercise their  right of self-determination. Australia would support the despatch  of United Nations observers to Portuguese Timor to see than an -   appropriate process of self-determination took place. Australia  would expect that if Indonesia appeared before the Security

Council, Indonesia would respond to the international concern  which had been aroused over.the fate of the people in the  territory and would explain clearly her motives and intentions.

MrÂ·Peacock said that the Australian Government would be  asking its Ambassador in Jakarta to explain to the Indonesian  authorities the views which Australia would seek to present to theÃ¢ÂÂ¢*.  Security Council. The Ambassador would also be instructed to tellCy  the Indonesian Government once again that the use of force_in  Portuguese Timor was not an appropriate way to solve the problems  of the territory.

In the midst of the tragedy of Portuguese Timor, Mr Peacock continued, Australia stood ready to provide aid as  soon as the situation on the ground permitted. "We are approaching  the Indonesian Government in this sense with a-request for .

assurances about the security of the Australian personnel that  would be involved," he said.

The Minister concluded by saying that when the Fourth  Committee of the United Nations General Assembly resumed its  discussion of Portuguese Timor tonight, the Australian representÂ­ ative would repeat Australia's call for an immediate cease-fire

and wish to see a process of self-determination applied under  proper United Nations supervision.
