APPOINTMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE REFUGEE REVIEW 
TRIBUNAL

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced the a ppointment of Mr John Godfrey as Acting 
Principal Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) for a six month 
period following the departure of Dr Peter Nygh who was acting in the 
Principal Member position until 31 May 1999.

Â

“Mr Godfrey is the Deputy Principal Member of the 
RRT and was the logical choice to take up this acting appointment. He 
has a wealth of experience that he will be able to use in managing the 
RRT until a permanent appointment can be made.”

Â

Mr Ruddock also announced that twenty-one current 
full-time and part-time members of the RRT whose terms of appointment 
were due to cease shortly have been reappointed to the Tribunal.

Â

Eleven full-time member reappointments to the RRT 
have been made until 31 January 2001. The members are: Janet Wood, John 
Booth, Michael Griffin, Eraine Grotte, Pamela Gutman, Margaret Holmes, 
Chris Keher, Dinoo Kelleghan, Gary Klintworth, Kim Rosser and Peter 
Thomson. Mr Lawry Herron has been reappointed as a full-time member 
until 31 October 1999.

Â

The members reappointed to the RRT on a part-time 
basis until 31 January 2001 are:

Wendy Boddison, Norma Ford, Janet Duckmanton, Patricia 
Leehy, Rosie Mathlin, Annemarie Nicholl, Stuart Russell, Sherine Salama 
and Ron Witton.

Â

“Mr Ruddock also said that a number of further appointments 
will be made to the Tribunal later in the year. These RRT reappointments 
will ensure that the RRT is sufficiently staffed to undertake its responsibilities.”
