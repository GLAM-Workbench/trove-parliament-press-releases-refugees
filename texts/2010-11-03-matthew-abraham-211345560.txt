E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

QUESTION:

We welcome to the programme Tony Abbott, Federal Leader of the Opposition. Tony Abbott, good  morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Matt and David, thanks for having me on.

QUESTION:

Well, have you backed a winner with Joe Hockey; a pre-emptive strike on the banks?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think Joe has certainly been vindicated. I think that this is yet another example of Wayne Swan talking  tough but he’s all bluster, he doesn’t deliver and the big difference between the current Government and the  former one is that in the days of Howard and Costello the banks did not jump well ahead of the Reserve  Bank increase and I think it is a sign, as Joe said, that we’ve got a weak, insipid Treasurer.

QUESTION:

What could the Government do, though, to force the banks to stick with the Reserve Bank figure?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it could do some of the things that Joe talked about last week. They could outlaw price signalling  where one banks says publicly that it’s going to have to increase rates by more than any Reserve Bank rate  increase because of the cost of funds and then the rest all agree and then they go up by more than the  Reserve Bank and..

QUESTION:

But how would you be able to outlaw that? Because a bank it’s a private institution, it can charge whatever it  likes for its money and then it gives a reason for it, the others come out and give similar reasons. How would  you be able to prove that that’s somehow price fixing?

TONY ABBOTT:

But anti-competitive behaviour is outlawed under Trade Practices Act. Now, obviously its not always easy  to prove collusive behaviour but I think in this case it’s, if you like, publicly collusive behaviour and the  ACCC has recommended that it be done and we’d be very happy for the Government to follow ACCC  advice on this.

QUESTION:

So are you seriously suggesting that the four major banks get together; because that’s what colluding means,  that you agree to manipulate interest rates, the word colluding has a very specific meaning doesn’t it under  ACCC?

TONY ABBOTT:

But what I’m saying is that we need to ensure that we don’t have anti-competitive behaviour in the sector.  The Government needs to ensure this and the ACCC has asked for the power to act against price signalling.  Joe Hockey said that that’s what the Government should do last week. The Government itself is now sort of  shamefacedly admitting that it is going to have to follow Joe’s suggestions of last week and what we  basically need is more competition in the banking sector and this is what the Government has to deliver.

QUESTION:

What else could you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Joe also suggested that we should have a new inquiry into the banking sector because a lot has  changed since the global financial crisis. Before then something like 30 per cent of home loans were with  the non-banks. That competition has now almost dried up. So basically we need to get more competition into  the sector and that’s what Joe’s nine points were about, getting more competition in.

QUESTION:

Now, you’re heading to the Adelaide Hills, you’re in your car right now - Tony Abbott here on 891  mornings - for a meeting. It’s a public meeting at Inverbrackie at 10:30 over the Inverbrackie detention  centre. What message will you be taking to that meeting?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ll be trying to be more of a listener than, I suppose, a dictator from Canberra. I think that there’s  been too much governmental arrogance lately and I think the people of Inverbrackie feel very used and  abused by the Government. So I’ll be there to say that I want to hear from them rather than just spout my  own views. But plainly we wouldn’t have this problem, we wouldn’t have this problem if the Government  could stop the boats. That’s essentially what the Government has to do, to stop the boats, because if the  boats keep coming the people in them have got to be housed somewhere and that’s why you’ve got the  situation now where military bases right around the country are being looked at by the Government as  potential housing for asylum seekers.

QUESTION:

The Prime Minister has been meeting with the President of Indonesia though in the last day or so and he has  agreed to look at a regional processing centre. Labor may well find an answer with this offshore.

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t think anyone is fooled by these meetings. I mean, I think all the Prime Minister has got is a polite  hearing. She’s got nothing like agreement to do this and frankly any regional centre in East Timor would be  a magnet, not a deterrent, for boat people.

QUESTION:

Tony Abbott, this meeting at the Woodside Community Hall has been organised by the people who are  opposed to the detention centre in Woodside. What will you be doing to get a balanced view, because some  people also in the community welcome the detention centre and are putting purple ribbons around trees, I  think probably lining your route in parts to signal their support?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I won’t just be standing on a stage pontificating, I’ll be moving around in the meeting and I’ll be  giving people plenty of opportunity to put a private view to me. So if anyone wants to come to this meeting  and take me aside and say that they think it’s a good idea what the Government is doing obviously they’re  very welcome to do so.

QUESTION:

What would it take to persuade you that it’s a good idea to have a detention centre at a place like  Inverbrackie?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I suppose the first thing I’d want to see is better process from the Government. Now, you don’t just  dump something down somewhere without talking to the locals first and that’s the problem here. It may or  may not be an ideal location, but even if it was the best location in the world you don’t just present things to  people as a fait accompli and I think this is one of the things that has most angered people, that they feel  they’ve been treated very badly by an arrogant Government which has got a problem and it’s asking them to  sort out its problem without asking them first.

QUESTION:

And Tony Abbott do you share Liberal South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi’s concerns that the Federal  Government might in some way accommodate Sharia law in the finance and banking system?

TONY ABBOTT:

Let’s see what the Government proposes. Now, they’ve publicly called for sort of an investigation of this.  I’m all in favour of us maximising our financial opportunities but the last thing I want to do is, I suppose,  see funny money practices happening in Australia and so let’s see what the Government comes up with.

QUESTION:

Are you talking about the Commonwealth Bank there?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I’m talking about Sharia finance law. Let’s see what the Government comes up with. But our job as an  Opposition is to subject anything that the Government proposes to robust scrutiny. As I said, we’re all in  favour of Australia developing as a financial hub. One of the reasons why we have some concerns about the  potential sale of the Australian Stock Exchange to Singapore is because on the one hand we want to develop  ourselves as a financial hub, and on the other hand we’ve got this bid in. So, you know, let’s see what the  Government proposes. They’re the Government; we’re the Opposition. Their job is to improve the country,  our job is to subject their proposals to scrutiny.

QUESTION:

Tony Abbott, thanks for talking to us this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you.
