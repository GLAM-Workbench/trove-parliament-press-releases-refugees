Labor’s border protection failures hit the streets of Brisbane

Labor’s  border  protection  failures  have  hits  the  streets  of  Brisbane,  Federal  Member  for  Brisbane   Teresa  Gambaro  said  today  following  revelations  that  26  asylum  seekers  have  been  housed  in   commercial premises in inner city  Brisbane  without  required building, licensing or accommodation  approvals from local and state authorities.

Ms Gambaro, who is also Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Citizenship and Settlement, said this  revelation was just the tip of the iceberg following Labor’s decision last year to release thousands of  asylum seekers from detention centres on bridging visas into the general community.

“This mess is a direct result of Labor’s failed border security policies. Since Labor came to power in  November  2007,  we  have  seen  537  boats  and  31,087  arrivals  leading  to  budget  blow  out  of  $6.6   billion dollars.

“This  has  also  led  to  a  failure  to  adequately  resource  settlement  services  for  new  migrants  and   refugees in this country.”

Ms Gambaro highlighted the fact that this latest revelation came hot on the heels of a similar expose  in  Perth  earlier  this  week  where  it  was  revealed  that  asylum  seekers  were  being  housed  in   backpackers’ accommodation.

“Unfortunately, we are going to see more of this - it is grossly irresponsible of Labor to just dump  these  asylum  seekers  into  the  general  community  without  proper  checks  and  safeguards  being   undertaken and put in place to ensure their health and safety.

“Minister Bowen has a lot of questions to answer here:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ what  actual  processes  are  in  place  to  ensure  settlement  service  providers  undertake  all   necessary checks to ensure accommodations services are properly accredited?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ how much money has been paid by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) to  settlement service providers across the country for these arrangements?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ how was this dodgy arrangement approved?   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ was an assessment ever undertaken by DIAC into his facility? and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ what is he going to do to ensure this never happens again?

“But,  more  importantly,  the  question  I  want  Minister  Bowen  to  answer  is  where  are  these  young   men are now? Are they being looked after in properly accredited facilities now?

“The  Minister  cannot  just  casually  try  and  sweep  this  problem  under  the  carpet  and  hope  it  goes   away  in  the  same  cavalier  fashion  in  which  Labor  has  just  dumped  these  asylum  seekers  into  the   community without a second thought as to their welfare or that of the wider community.

“This Minister has to come clean on what he’s going to do to fix up this catastrophic mess.”
