MEDIA RELEASE

Thursday, 13 February 2014

Refugee health panel sacked, because it did its  job…

The release of documents under Freedom of Information laws has shown that the Immigration  Health Advisory Group, which was tasked with giving the government advice on the physical and  mental health of refugees in detention, was disbanded because of concerns that it would reveal  the truth about the situation inside Australia’s detention network, the Australian Greens have  said.

“Operation Secret Boats is a media strategy with an extraordinary and concerning reach that  stretches throughout the government,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.

“This revelation shows that the government was worried IHAG wouldn’t toe the line on its cruel  policies and disbanded it to avoid independent scrutiny of its inhumane practices.

“This government is willing to risk permanently damaging refugees’ mental health in order to  protect its dirty secrets.

“Far from being ineffective, as Tony Abbott claimed when the group was gutted in December,  IHAG was being too effective in exposing the terrible treatment of refugees.

“Australians are becoming increasingly concerned with the government’s secrecy, as today’s  Galaxy Poll has shown.”
