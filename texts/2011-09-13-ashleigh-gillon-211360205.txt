THE HON DR CRAIG EMERSON MP  MINISTER FOR TRADE





Transcript

Sky News AM Agenda with Ashleigh Gillon



13 September 2011

E&OE

Subjects: President Obama’s visit, Kevin Rudd’s health, carbon pricing, asylum-seekers,  Craig Thomson.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Good morning, welcome to the program. I'm  Ashleigh Gillon.

This morning, the White House has confirmed

President Obama is heading to Australia. The  US President will be here for two days from  November 16. But no word yet on which cities  he'll visit or if his family will be accompanying  him.

We are hoping that he will actually turn up this

time. It will be, after all, third time lucky after  the President was forced to cancel his last two  scheduled visits to our shores.

Joining me this morning on our panel of

politicians, the Trade Minister and Acting  Foreign Minister, Craig Emerson. Good  morning to you.

CRAIG EMERSON: Morning Ashleigh.

GILLON: And the Leader of the Opposition in the

Senate, Senator Eric Abetz.

ERIC ABETZ: Morning.

GILLON: Good morning to you as well.

Craig, let's start with you. President Obama

coming here to Australia. What's going to be  on the agenda for the talks?

EMERSON: Oh well, obviously, a wide range of issues but

it is the 60th Anniversary of the Alliance - and if  I could acknowledge that both major political  parties have been staunch supporters of the  Alliance over that period. It's served Australia's  interests well; it's served the interests of peace  and stability well.

On the economic front, we have in the

developed world a pretty feeble economic  recovery after the global recession, which was  the deepest since the Great Depression. And,  of course, I'm going to express a bit of bias  from my other portfolio responsibilities: that is,



Page:  3





on trade. Free and open trade is the formula to  getting the global economy really moving  again, and we do have a problem with the  Doha Round being stuck. So, I'm sure that will  figure in the discussions that the Prime Minister  and the President have here in Australia.

GILLON: Yes. And the President's coming via Honolulu,

where he'll be at the APEC meeting. He's  chairing that, and then heading to Bali straight  after to go to the East Asia Summit. What's the  Coalition hoping to get out of this visit,  Senator? And would you like, perhaps, to see  Parliament recalled so that the President can  address both Houses if he wishes?

ABETZ: If that were the Government's view - having the

Parliament sit in honour of President Obama - I  think that would be something that would be  welcomed by all sides of politics and the  Australian people.

Our relationship with the United States is our

most important relationship. They were with us  in the Second World War; they were vitally  important in the defence of Australia, especial  in the Coral Sea etcetera.

So, I think we have bonds that are etched not

only in our history, but also blood bonds in war,  especially during the Second World War. So,  any United States President is always welcome



Page:  4





in Australia. And we as a Coalition welcome  anything that strengthens those ties.

GILLON: Minister, is that an option: recalling Parliament

if President Obama would like to address both  Houses?

And do you think Julia Gillard might get a

bounce in the polls when she's standing there  shaking hands with the US President.

ABETZ: Oh, that's a big “if”, isn't it, Ashleigh?

EMERSON: Look, I can't say anything pre-emptive in

relation to a possible recall of Parliament. But  the President's visit is not about polls. I think,  when we saw President Bush visiting he was  welcomed very warmly by both sides of  politics. And there were, in fact, some real  differences between our side of politics and the  Republicans at that time. But those differences  never cloud the visit of a president and that's  what we're seeking to do: build on that  relationship as we modernise the relationship  in the 21st Century.

GILLON: Kevin Rudd and Barack Obama seemed to get

on well last time. Kevin Rudd was in

Washington and Barack Obama just popped in  to say hi…

EMERSON: [Laughs]



Page:  5





GILLON:  … in an unscheduled meeting. How is Kevin

Rudd going, Craig Emerson? You've been…

EMERSON: Yeah, he's going pretty well.

GILLON: … acting in his role.

EMERSON: He's going pretty well.

GILLON: Do you think he'll be back on deck soon?

EMERSON: He'll be back on deck soon. I understand he

will be going to the AUSMIN talks, with  Stephen Smith, our Defence Minister. So, my  period as Acting Foreign Minister is about to  come to a close.

But, then again, when he goes overseas, they'll

need another Acting Foreign Minister and it  could well be me.

GILLON: And you might be…

EMERSON: So, I'll be back in this as soon as Kevin's back;

then I'll be back into Acting Foreign Minister  mode.

GILLON: Would you expect to see a bounce in the polls

when President Obama's here, for Labor?



Page:  6





ABETZ: Oh, look, let's wait and see what happens. I

think it's always a good news story when an  important figure such as the President of the  United States visits. But, at the end of the day,  the difficulties the Government has got are  domestic policies; not so much its relationship  with the United States.

GILLON: Well, let's move on to those domestic policies.

Before we get into our chatter about those,  though, I do want to flag with you that we are  standing by to take you live to Julia Gillard.  She's addressing the Steel Institute conference  here in Canberra. That's coming up in about 10  or 15 minutes time, so we'll take you live there  when it does happen. That's…

EMERSON: We're going to get trumped, Eric.

[Laughter]

GILLON: We're going to cut short our discussion for the

Prime Minister.

Let's move on to what's happening in

Parliament today. The carbon tax legislation is  going to be presented about midday today.  There are 18 Bills.

Senator, the Coalition's been complaining that

not enough time has been put aside to allow  the Coalition to go through these complex



Page:  7





pieces of legislation. But the Government's put  in an extra week for the Senate to sit and is  saying that there'll be extra hours on Mondays  and Tuesdays; have already scheduled sitting  weeks. What more are you asking for?

ABETZ: Well, first of all, this legislation was the

legislation the Australian people were promised  we would not have. The parliamentary  timetable, as it was scheduled, was all in order,  but for this imposition of the carbon tax which  was specifically promised to the Australian  people would not occur.

If we accept what Labor says - that this is the

biggest package of change ever in Australian  history - then I would invite Labor to wind back  and ask what happened with the GST.

With the GST legislation, it was in the Senate

for five months with four different Senate  committees.

Now, if carbon tax is a bigger change than the

GST, Labor has got to answer to the Australian  people.

Having promised no carbon tax, why on earth

would you not allow at least five months of  Senate investigation for this bigger-than-Ben-Hur change to Australia's economy. And that is  the issue that has got Labor in great difficulty.



Page:  8





The deception, and now trying to rush it  through.

GILLON: The Climate Change Minister, Greg Combet,

pointed out this morning, there have already  been, apparently, 35 inquiries into carbon  pricing and what to do to tackle climate change

Surely, the time for delay is over. The

Government has the numbers in the

Parliament to get this through.

ABETZ: It is not time for us to accept. Because

remember, Labor said the Carbon Pollution  Reduction Scheme - and when they were  promoting that, Senator Penny Wong, the  Climate Change Minister, absolutely bagged  out, quite rightly so, might I add, the concept of  a carbon tax; that it wasn't a silver bullet; that it  wouldn't work. And so we have a situation  where Labor had a Carbon Pollution Reduction  Scheme, condemned the carbon tax, then  dumped the Carbon Pollution Reduction  Scheme altogether, then promised no carbon  tax.

Now they're going to have a carbon tax and we

still have not seen one word of the legislation.  And we know with this Government, they're  always big on the headlines; big on the  promise: like the East Timor solution, like the  Malaysian solution, for border protection. Cash



Page:  9





for clunkers: you name it; always big on the  headlines. When you ask for the detail, it all  collapses and implodes.

So we want to see the legislation word-for-

word; inquire into it and see what's actually  going to be served up.

GILLON: We'll get to that asylum-seeker issue shortly.

Craig Emerson, why not give the Coalition

more time on this? Greg Hunt has done the  maths. He's worked out it's less than one  minute per MP per piece of legislation.

EMERSON: Well, I think you've summarised the…

GILLON: If this is something so crucial - transforming the

economy - why not have more time to debate  it?

EMERSON: I think you've summarised it in your question:

and that is, 30-odd inquiries; the Coalition's  view is well known; it's expressed in a 34-page  document, most of which are just completely  false statements.

I heard Greg Hunt on radio this morning saying

that the carbon price is forcing the steel  industry into great difficulty. This is not a view  that is shared by the steel industry.



Page:  10





So you see, the Liberal mantra is Ã¢ÂÂwhy put off

till tomorrow what you can put off foreverÃ¢ÂÂ. And  they simply do not want any price on carbon.  And I'm glad that Eric mentioned the Carbon  Pollution Reduction Scheme, because the  fundamental difference between this scheme  and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is  the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme had a  one-year fixed price permit; this has a three-year fixed price permit.

Everyone said the Carbon Pollution Reduction

Scheme was an emissions trading scheme, but  this one's not? What? It's a difference of two  years. I mean, it is a market-based

mechanism; it's the sort of policy that John  Howard took to the 2007 election. We've been  debating this for ages. We know the Coalition's  answer. The Coalition's answer is Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ.  It  prefers a direction action plan that would cost  every household in Australia $1,300 in extra  tax.

ABETZ: Well, that is just nonsense, Ashleigh. But what

we're seeing yet again is Labor repeating its  own mistakes again. The rush for the Carbon  Pollution Reduction Scheme was so that Kevin  Rudd could wave a document at Copenhagen.  He wanted us to be the clowns of

Copenhagen; the only country in the world with  a scheme that was fully legislated.



Page:  11





This time round the rush is so that we can be

the dunces of Durban by having some  legislation in place when no other country in  the world will have as extensive a scheme, as  expensive a scheme, and as job-destroying a  scheme as Australia's going to have.

EMERSON: You've just described Malcolm Turnbull as a

dunce. Because, of course, he supported the  Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and lost  the leadership over it.

GILLON: Okay, well look, Tim Flannery is going to be…

ABETZ: Well, the Coalition…

GILLON: …Tim Flannery today - we do need to move

on. Tim Flannery today is going to be

addressing the National Press Club. He's going  to be arguing against that position you just put  forward, Eric Abetz. He'll be with some  international experts from the US and China  today at the National Press Club at 12.30  arguing that the world is in fact acting on  climate change. So tune in for that one at  12.30 today. It'll be live on Sky News. We do  need to get through…

ABETZ: Well, actually, can I take issue with that

because the world is not moving in this  direction. New Zealand is winding back; the  European Union is winding back…



Page:  12





GILLON: Okay.

EMERSON: The United Kingdom?

ABETZ: New Hampshire is winding back, etcetera.

EMERSON: David Cameron? Conservative Prime Minister,

David Cameron?

GILLON: All right, we've heard, we've heard that point

and I'm just pointing out that we'll hear another  view on that a bit later today.

I do want to move onto the asylum-seeker

issue, though, because that is of course one  that's been dominating discussion here in  Parliament over the last couple of days.

We know, of course, that yesterday Julia

Gillard won support from the Caucus to try to  amend the Migration Act. That's so the  Government can get around that High Court  ruling and continue on with its Malaysian  solution. But it needs the Coalition onside in  order for those changes to the Migration Act to  go ahead. We've seen the Government  pressuring Tony Abbott over this.

Here was the Immigration Minister, Chris

Bowen, last night.



Page:  13





[Excerpt from earlier interview]

CHRIS BOWEN: Well now, we've made that advice available to  the Opposition. That's not just departmental  advice; that's advice from all the experts: from  the Department of Immigration, from the  National Security Adviser, from the

Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues.

The Government's top officials have been

made available to the Opposition. So if they  ignore that advice and if they, in an act of  political bloody-mindedness, say, Ã¢ÂÂwell, if you  won't do Nauru we're not going to give you the  options or the ability to implement your policyÃ¢ÂÂ,  well, that will be a matter for them to explain to  the Australian people.

[End of excerpt]

GILLON: Senator, is there a concern that the longer

Tony Abbott delays his decision on whether or  not to support the changes to the Migration  Act, the more boats will come? Because there  is effectively a policy vacuum and people  smugglers could take advantage of that.

ABETZ: Well, actually, the first question is: where is the

expert advice that was offered to the

Government when they deliberately changed  from the proven Howard solution?



Page:  14





EMERSON: Oh, completely wrong …

ABETZ: We have never been given that. We have

never been given the expert advice…

EMERSON: You've been given advice a couple of days

ago.

ABETZ: Excuse me, Craig. When we have been …

when we have asked for the advice on the East  Timor solution, that came to nothing - we  haven't been provided it. When we asked for  the expert advice in relation to the Malaysian  solution, we haven't been provided it.

EMERSON: You have been. That's untrue.

ABETZ:                No, no, no. Now, you are giving us advice that

the previous legal advice that you had, which  said you were going to win the High Court  challenge, is, of course, now shown to be  completely and utterly flawed.

And so, when this Government says Ã¢ÂÂhere's

some expert adviceÃ¢ÂÂ, we want to have a very  close look at it. And, above all, we want to  have a look at the actual wording of the  legislation. So, the Government won't get a  pre-commitment out of this until we've seen the  legislation.



Page:  15





GILLON: That's fair enough, isn't it, Craig Emerson? I

mean, this legislation hasn't even been drafted  yet, has it?

EMERSON: Well, attention is rightly focused on Mr Abbott

now. And the question is, does Mr Abbott want  to stop the boats or does he want to stop  Labor? Now, he says he's been … his mantra,  his three-word mantra, the slogan is, “stop the  boats”. He has an opportunity now…

ABETZ: He did not. He didn't.

EMERSON: He has an opportunity now to join with Labor in

stopping people making these terribly risky  journeys across the sea.

We will see whether he regards his political

interest as being more important than the  interests of people who make those very risky  journeys. I think the verdict is yet to be

delivered. Let's see what Mr Abbott says about  this. But the longer he delays - as you've  pointed out - the more likelihood that more  boats will come and people will be risking their  lives.

GILLON: We understand, itÃ¢ÂÂs fair enough you want to

see the legislation, moving forward and Tony  Abbott wants to go through that with a fine-toothed comb. But on principle, do you think  the Coalition will end up supporting this,



Page:  16





because it would end up ensuring that  whatever party's in Government, the Executive  would have the decision of where to send  asylum-seekers offshore.

ABETZ: Our policy has always been to stop the boats.

We achieved that in Government. Labor  deliberately unpicked that policy solution. We  had a flood of boats come in. And, of course,  Ms Gillard, when she was Shadow Immigration  Minister at the time, said Ã¢ÂÂevery boat is another  indication of the failed policyÃ¢ÂÂ. That was in the  Howard Government. We actually fixed the  problem. She now has over 100 boats under  her belt and she still claims that there hasn't  been a policy failure on Labor's part.

What they've done is unpicked a workable,

proven Coalition solution, and they're now  trying to stick Bandaids all over it. First of all, it  was East Timor, then Malaysia. They've both  fallen apart, and we invite them yet again…

GILLON: Craig Emerson…

ABETZ: … to have a look at our policies.

GILLON: … do you acknowledge that there have been

mistakes in the border protection policy from  Labor? We've seen the influx of boats; we saw  the failed East Timor solution, as Eric Abetz



Page:  17





pointed out. There have been a lot of problems  in …

EMERSON: Well, I think it's a vexed issue for both sides of

politics. It's not only a vexed issue for both  sides of politics in Australia. It's a vexed issue  in Europe, if you look at the number of people  who are arriving unauthorised in Europe.

And Eric says Ã¢ÂÂoh, we fixed the problem in the

Nauru solutionÃ¢ÂÂ. The same expert advice that is  talking about the Malaysian solution has told  Mr Abbott that Nauru does not work. Does not  work!

ABETZ: That's not right.

EMERSON: And one of the key reasons … it is right; it is

absolutely what he was told. And one of the  key reasons is that it is now well known that  perhaps three-quarters, or more, of those who  went to Nauru ended up in Australia.

The people smugglers know that; they can

explain that to people who they seek to entice  onto boats. And they say Ã¢ÂÂwell, you just get to  park in Nauru for a while, but you'll end up in  Australia anywayÃ¢ÂÂ.

And that's why this is … it moves. The whole

issue moves as circumstances change. And



Page:  18





yes, circumstances have changed over the last  decade.

ABETZ: I am being told that Julia Gillard is about to

take the stage at the Australian Steel Institute  conference, so we are going to take you there  in just a couple of minutes when that gets  under way.

Just finally, yesterday, New South Wales  Police announced that it will be investigating  officials at the Health Services Union - Craig  Thomson, of course, included. Does that  vindicate the Opposition's line of attack against  Mr Thomson?

EMERSON: Not at all; not at all. And, in fact, the Opposition

has been making deliberately false claims.

Both Senator Brandis and Mr Abbott have said

that the police, in relation to Mr Brandis'…

GILLON: Okay, I'm sorry, Senator, I didn't get to you on

that issue. I do need to throw to Julia Gillard  now speaking here in Canberra.
