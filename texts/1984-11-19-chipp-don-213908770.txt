PRESS RELEASE

No. 84/277

THE SENATE . CANBERRA

19 November 1984

CHIPP: FOREIGN DEBT A SYMPTOM OF ECONOMIC MALAISE

"Australia's massive foreign debt is a symptom of the economic

failures of recent; Australian governments", Senator Chipp, Leader

of the Australian Democrats, said today.

"Governments have directed Australia's economic development into

areas that ultimately do not deliver the goods. The Labor governÂ­

ment is simply perpetuating this problem. Our.record $40 billion .

of foreign debt is the product of a series of governments who

believed that developing Australia's resources potential was the

only way to future wealth. They encouraged foreign investment in

order to develop the mining industries. We are now saddled with a

huge foreign debt whilst the mining sector cannot provide the

export revenue to service this debt.  In fact, the very foreign

customers that encouraged us to develop our resources' export

potential are now forcing us to accept lower prices for the commodities

that they told us would always be in great demand.

"The Labor Party has reneged on its commitment to control the

volume and the direction of foreign investment into Australia.

It has become the tool of foreign governments and multinationals

which ultimately do not have the long term economic interests of

Australia at heart. The 1983 Foreign Investment Review Board

report revealed that of the 944 investment proposals only 43 involved  '  '  Ã¢ÂÂ  :  S  .

the establishment of new businesses and only 3 were in the '

manufacturing sector.

OVER___

-2-

"This means that Australia will continue to 'increase its foreign

debt and continue to rely on the resources sector to increase

our wealth. The result is that our living standards will

continue to decline relative to OECD countries and the developing

Asian countries. The manufacturing sector will continue to decline

and to be dominated by multinationals which will make sure that

Australian enterprises do not develop our own export potential.

"The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Button, .

recently stated that a 1manufacturing sector....ds an essential

prerequisite to a successful tertiary sector, where the bulk of

employment lies.1  Yet the government is still dreaming of mining

Eldorados, leaves our manufacturing sector to stagnate, and relies

on increasing overseas investment to maintain our living standards.

This is a recipe for economic decline. Liberal and Labor governments

alike are making short-term economic decisions that will ensure

that Australia follows Argentina from riches to rags.
