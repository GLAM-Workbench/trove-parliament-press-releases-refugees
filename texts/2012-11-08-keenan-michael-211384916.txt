Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 2GB Interview with Ben Fordham November 08, 2012

Topics: 500th illegal boat arrival under Labor

Ben Fordham

A milestone has been reached today. 500 asylum seeker vessels since Labor came to power in 2007. This brings the tally  of asylum seeker arrivals to 15 boats and 764 people just this week. In the five years since Labor took power it is now  almost 30,000 people that have come to Australia by boat. Michael Keenan, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and  Border Protection, good afternoon.

Michael Keenan

Good afternoon Ben, how are you?

Ben Fordham

I’m alright. It is not a record that anyone is proud of?

Michael Keenan

It is a record of catastrophic failure. When Julia Gillard was the Opposition Immigration spokesperson before the Labor  Party got into government, she said any boat that arrived was a policy failure, yet we have had 500 boats under the Labor  Party which shows you that Labor are incapable of doing what everyone expects the Federal government to do and that is  have some control over who comes to our country.

Ben Fordham

30,000 people, it is extraordinary. It is nearly double the number that arrived over the 11 years of the Howard  Government. More people have arrived in 2012 than in any other year and last month was a record breaker. You had 43  boats and 2227 people all in the space of one month. Something has got to give?

Michael Keenan

That’s right and one of the most galling thing is when the Labor Party came to office they took some very stupid decisions  to abolish the Howard Government’s policies that had solved this problem when they came to office, that led to this  catastrophic failure and they have reinvigorated people smuggling that had been squashed by the previous government.  All of the expense, all of the tragedy, all of the terrible things associated with this failure to police our borders, never  needed to have happened and I think the Australian people are right to feel pretty angry about it.

Ben Fordham

Chris Bowen the Immigration Minister has just put out a release saying a group of 30 single Sri Lankan adult men have  been returned to Sri Lanka on a chartered flight to Colombo from Christmas Island today. The second involuntary removal  in two days. So they are sending them back home the problem is more are arriving then those being sent home?

Michael Keenan

We have a flood of illegal arrivals and they are sending a trickle back home. They sent 30 today, in a week where we have  had 764 people arrive. They need to be sending people back at the same rate that people are arriving. Of course they are  not doing anything near that. Sadly, like everything Labor has done with this issue, it is just too little too late. They should  have been returning people home, who don’t have a legitimate claim for asylum, a long time before now

Ben Fordham

I just want to play something very quickly for you and get your comment on this. This is Julia Gillard, who has been very  vocal against your policy of turning the boats back around. This is Julia Gillard in 2002:

“We think that it is important that we do everything we can to disrupt people smuggling and we think turning boats around  that are sea worthy and can make the return journey and are in international waters, fits in with that.”

Any comment on the fact that the policy that Julia Gillard is ripping you guys to shreds on at the moment she actually  supported back then?

Michael Keenan

It is just another indication that Labor has absolutely no idea what they believe on these issues. Turning the boats back  around was actually their policy before the 2007 election. Julia Gillard believed in it, Kevin Rudd believed in it and that was

a Labor Party policy and their own committee, the Houston Committee said that if they were to adopt this policy again it  would actually work as an effective deterrent. It is a very important way to send a message that Australia is not going to  put up with this people smuggling anymore and I really don’t understand why the Labor Party seem so intent on vilifying it  rather than just going ahead and implementing it in a way that is going to do something to resolve this problem.

Ben Fordham

Michael Keenan thanks for your time.

Michael Keenan

Good to talk to you Ben.
