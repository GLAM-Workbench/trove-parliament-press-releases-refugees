TRANSCRIPT  14 August 2012  Interview on The Project  Channel 10



CHARLIE PICKERING:        Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare, is in  Canberra.

Jason, you've just come out of Parliament, is

the political point scoring going on and who's  winning?

JASON CLARE:                     The good news is there's less political point  scoring, and you've got politicians working together  for the first time in a long time.

We’ve been fighting about this for over ten

years.  Next week is the eleventh anniversary of  the Tampa, people are sick of us fighting.  And the  good news is the politicians have stopped fighting  and we're going to vote on legislation over the  course of the next few days.

ANDREW ROCHFORD:       Jason is it slightly embarrassing that it took an  expert panel of just three people to come up to this  point where you have finally stopped fighting, and  not the politicians that we all voted for to deal with  these exact situations?

JASON CLARE:                     That's a good point.  I think people are sick of  politicians fighting about this.  People have been  screaming at their TV sets and saying just fix this,  and the good news is we've got a breakthrough,  we're going to be able to pass legislation this  week.

CHARLIE PICKERING:        Now Tony Abbott has claimed that the  recommendations in the report are a victory for  him.

They're certainly very different to the policies

that Labor started with in this whole debate.  How  soon do you think that these can be put into  practice?

JASON CLARE:                     Well we should be able to implement it very  quickly; we're talking weeks rather than  months.  We'll send a Defence team to Nauru and  to Manus on Friday to do a reconnaissance  trip.  And the Prime Minister has said today that  she wants people processed at Nauru within a  month.

CARRIE BICKMORE:           The Greens don't like it, refugee advocates don't  like it, even Clive Palmer today said that this policy  is cruel.  Do you think it's humane?

JASON CLARE:                     I think it is humane.  This is about stopping  people from dying; this is designed to stop people  drowning at sea.  It also means, Carrie, that we're  going to double the number of refugees that  Australia takes.  So it means an extra seven  thousand people a year will be able to call  Australia home. That's the most humane thing we  can do.

CARRIE BICKMORE:           When you say it's to stop people dying at sea, it's  to deter people, the people smugglers, people  from getting on the boats.  But we spoke to a  former refugee today and she disagrees, have a  listen.

NAJEEBA WAZEFDEST:    The only option to seek refuge and to get out of  that desperate situation and circumstance is to get  on a boat.

CARRIE BICKMORE:           She believes people will still get on those boats.

JASON CLARE:                     Well the advice of Angus Houston and the team  is that this is the best way to get people to go  through the UN processes, rather than pay a  people smuggler ten thousand dollars and get on a  boat.  I understand that people are in terrible  situations all around the world, we want to help as  many people as we can.  That's why we want to  double the number of refugees we take every year  as part of this.  What we don’t want is people  drowning.

DAVE HUGHES:                    We're going to want to hope that this deterrent  works very quickly mate, because I've done some  maths two billion dollars to house, or to detain, two  thousand refugees.  We’ve has almost eight  thousand turn up this year already.  I mean it's  going to get very full very quick, isn't it?

JASON CLARE:                     Well that’s why this needs to be implemented as  a package of measures.  You're right; I think  people smugglers are going to try this on Dave,  they'll tell people just keep coming.

It's important that we implement this as quickly

as we possibly can and that's why the Prime  Minister said that the first people will be processed  in Nauru within a month.

CHARLIE PICKERING:        Well Jason we appreciate your time and  appreciate your candour.

JASON CLARE:                     Thanks guys, cheers.
