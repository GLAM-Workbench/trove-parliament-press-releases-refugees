RE-LISTING OF JAISH-E-MOHAMMAD, LASHKAR-E JHANGVI, ASBAT AL  ANSAR, THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF UZBEKISTAN, THE EGYPTIAN  ISLAMIC JIHAD AND THE ISLAMIC ARMY OF ADEN AS TERRORIST  ORGANISATIONS

Attorney-General Philip Ruddock announced today the Australian Government had  taken steps to re-list six terrorist organisations.

Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ), Asbat al Ansar (AAA), the  Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) and the  Islamic Army of Aden (IAA) will all be re-listed as terrorist organisations under the  Criminal Code Regulations 2002.

All six organisations were all initially listed as terrorist organisations on 11 April  2003 and again on 11 April 2005. As provided under Australia’s counter-terrorism  laws, the listings were due to expire on the second anniversary of the day on which  they took effect.

Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Sunni Islamic extremist organisation based in Pakistan  that operates in Indian Administered Kashmir, is involved in a number of  terrorist activities, including hijacking, bombings, abductions and training.  As  recently as November 2006, Indian authorities arrested members of Jaish-e-Mohammad and recovered explosives and funds, suggesting the group  continues to have the capacity and intent to conduct further terrorist attacks,  including against foreigners.

Lashkar-e Jhangvi targets assassinations and suicide bombings against Shia,  Christian, Western and government factions.  In January 2007, Pakistani  Intelligence agencies uncovered documentary evidence indicating that LeJ was  planning to accelerate its targeting of Shiite mosques and prominent Shiite  leaders and scholars.

Asbat al Ansar has shifted its focus to Iraq, sending fighters in support of the  insurgency in collaboration with al-Qaida. The group’s leadership make  statements supporting attacks conducted by other groups and advocating  violent jihad against the West.

Attorney General News Release 2

The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan has conducted terrorist attacks against  civilian, government and foreign targets in Central Asia.  The group’s tactics  include hostage-taking (including the taking of foreigners), firearms attacks and  car bombings. The IMU conducted a bomb attack in June 2005, and in early  2006 was involved in armed attacks against a detention centre, and customs and  border posts.

Members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad are active in the al-Qa’ida network. In  July 2006, the leader of the EIJ issued a video statement calling on Muslims to  target the interests of ‘all countries’ who participated in the ‘assault against the  Muslims’ in countries including Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a reference taken  to include Australia.

The Islamic Army of Aden has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks  against Yemeni and Western interests. This organisation has previously used  bombings and kidnappings as a means of furthering its goals. In 1998, the IAA  kidnapped 16 Western tourists, which resulted in the death of four tourists,  including an Australian during a rescue attempt.

The Attorney-General said these new listings w ould operate for two years . The offence  provisions in Division 102 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 continue to apply.

“It is an offence to be a member of, associate with, train with, provide training for,  receive funds from, make funds available to, direct or recruit for these  organisations,” Mr Ruddock said.

“This applies to conduct in Australia and overseas and carries penalties of up to 25  years’ imprisonment.”

Attorney General News Release 3

Lashkar -e Jhangvi (LeJ)

(Also known as: Lashkar -i-Jhangvi, Lashkar -e-Jhangvie, Laskar -e-Jhangvi, Lashkare Jhangvi, Lashkar -e-Jhangwi, Lashkar -i-Jhangwi, Jhangvi Army, Lashkar -e Jhangvi, Lashkar Jhangvi, Lashkar -e-Jhanvi, Lashkar -i-Jangvi, Lashkar e Jhangvi , Lashkar Jangvi, Laskar e Jahangvi).

LeJ is listed in the UN 1267 Committee’s consolidated list and as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Pakistan.

Current status of LeJ Lashkar -e Jhangvi (LeJ) is a Sunni Islamic terrorist group based in Pakistan. The group was formed in 1996 as a more militant splinter group of the radical sectarian organisation, the Sipah -e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and follows the Deobandi tradition of Sunni Islam. U nder the leadership of Riaz Basra, the LeJ quickly distinguished itself as the most violent and radical sectarian force in Pakistan.

LeJ is based primarily in the Punjab and Balochistan regions of Pakistan, and the port city of Karachi. It is responsible for numerous targeted killings and massacres. The group has targeted for assassination, not only opposing Shiite activists, but prominent Shiite officials, professionals and businessmen. It has assassinated Iranian nationals in Pakistan and was involved, a long with the Jaish e -Mohammad (JeM), in the abduction and murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl in January 2002. It has also instigated attacks, including small -arms attacks and suicide bombings, on Shiite mosques and processions, and Christian churches re sulting in the random killing of hundreds of people.

While sectarian attacks remain LeJ’s primary driving force, elements within LeJ have broadened the group’s focus to include the targeting of members of the Pakistani State and the Western presence in Pa kistan. As members of a previously unknown group “Jundallah,” LeJ trained members were among a number of militants drawn from several Pakistani extremist groups responsible for the twin car -bomb attack near the US Consulate in Karachi on 26 May 2004. On 9 June 2004, the same terrorist cell was involved in a terrorist attack against a heavily -armed military convoy carrying Karachi’s military commander resulting in seven deaths. More recently the LeJ was linked to the 2 March 2006 suicide car bombing on the U S Consulate in Karachi that killed a US diplomat.

LeJ derive a considerable portion of funding from wealthy benefactors in Karachi. Extortion from Shia banks and businesses is another significant means by which the LeJ raises finances for terrorist operat ions.

Pakistani government security crackdowns since late -2001 have had some success, but the group continues to recruit new members to replace those arrested or killed. Over half of Pakistan’s madrassas (religious schools) are Deobandi run and they provi de a fertile pool of manpower susceptible to LeJ recruitment.

The present status of LeJ training facilities is not known. LeJ training camps in Afghanistan were destroyed by the United States and their training facilities in Pakistan have been disrupted b y local police. Being part of a broader Deobandi movement, however, the LeJ can rely on the assistance of other militant Deobandi groups including its parent the SSP, JeM, the Jamiat ul -Ansar (JuA - also known as Harakat ul -Mujahideen or HuM), , and Haraka t ul -Jihad al -Islami (HuJI).

Attorney General News Release 4

The LeJ has an extremely close relationship with the Taliban and confirmed links with al -Qa'ida. LeJ operatives are thought to have received training from al -Qa’ida.

Objectives The LeJ’s ultimate objective is the establishme nt of an Islamic state in Pakistan based on a radical interpretation of Sharia law, through the use of violence. Part of a broader Sunni extremist movement, LeJ’s membership harbour an intense hatred of all foreign, or non -Islamic influences. The group is also fervently anti -Shia and aim to have them declared a non -Muslim minority.

Leadership and membership Muhammad Ajmal (aka Akram Lahori) is reportedly the present leader of the LeJ. Ajmal succeeded Riaz Basra following Basra’s death in May, 2002 as a re sult of a shootout with Pakistani police. Ajmal is himself in custody following his arrest in June 2002 for his alleged involvement in 38 cases of sectarian killings. Although Ajmal is officially considered the head of LeJ, Mufti Eid Mohammed is now believ ed to lead the organisation and operational command is understood to have passed to minor figures.

LeJ is estimated to have 300 active members. The LeJ maintains a multi -cellular structure, made up of loosely co -ordinated regional sub -units further divide d into several small cells that operate independently of one another.

LeJ engagement in terrorist activities The LeJ has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including targeted assassinations and suicide bombings against, Shia, Christian, Weste rn and government targets.

Recent terrorist attacks for which responsibility has been claimed by, or reliably attributed to, the LeJ, have included:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 8 January 2005: the attack on Shiite religious leader, Syed Agha Ziauddin Rizvi, in Gilgit, resulting in three deaths;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 28 September 2005: Two LeJ leaders arrested for planning the 27 and 30 May 2005 suicide bomb attacks on a Shiite mosque in Karachi and the Bari Imam shrine in Islamabad which killed a total of twenty -four people;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 2 March 2006: suic ide car bombing on the US Consulate in Karachi killing a US Diplomat Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 11 April 2006: suspected involvement in the bomb attack on Shiite worshippers at Nishtar Park in Karachi killing more than sixty people;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 14 July 2006: suicide bomb attack on Shiite cleric, Allama Hassan Turabi, in Karachi which also killed Turabi’s nephew, and injured three security guards; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1 January 2007: Pakistani Intelligence agencies claim uncovered documentary evidence indicates LeJ plan to accelerate their targeting of Shiite mosques and

prominent Shiite leaders and scholars.

Jaish -e-Mohammad (JeM)

(Also known as Jaish -e-Mohammed; Jaish -e-Muhammed; Jaish -e-Muhammad; Jaish -i-Mohammed; Jaish -i-Mohammad; Jaish -i-Muhammad; Jaish -i-Muhammed; Jesh -e-Mohammadi; Jaish -e-Moham mad Mujahideen E -Tanzeem; Tehrik al -Furgan; Tehrik Ul -Furqaan; Khuddam ul -Islam (KuI); Khudamul Islam; Kuddam e Islami; Jamaat ul -Furqan (JuF); Army of Mohammed; Mohammed’s Army; Army of the Prophet; National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sove reignty and Army of the Prophet. )

JeM is listed in the United Nations 1267 Committee’s consolidated list and by the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Pakistan, and India.

Current status of JeM JeM is a Sunni Islamic extremist organisation based in Pakistan that operates primarily in Indian Administered Kashmir (IAK). Established in 2000, JeM was founded by the radical Islamic scholar and jihadist leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, following his release from an Indian jail in exchan ge for 155 hostages hijacked aboard an Indian Airlines aircraft on New Years Eve 1999. With support from Usama bin Laden, the Taliban, and several other Sunni extremist organisations in Pakistan, Azhar did not return to his former group, the proscribed Isl amic militant group Harakat ul -Mujahideen (HuM), but formed JeM as a new group with almost identical aims to HuM.

JeM is aligned politically with Jamiat -e-Ulema -e-Islam Fazul Rehman faction (JUI -F), a prominent radical Islamic party in Pakistan and Kashmi r. Funding for JeM is derived from both legitimate business interests, including commodity trading and property, and through Islamic charitable foundations including the al -Rashid Trust. (whose accounts were ordered to be frozen by the UN Security Council for suspected links to al -Qai’da). JeM has conducted joint operations with Lashkar e -Tayyiba (LeT), and cooperates closely with other Islamic militant groups operating in Afghanistan, Kashmir and Pakistan such as HuM, the Hizb -ul -Mujahideen (HM), and the L ashkar e -Jhangvi (LeJ). JeM is also closely associated with al -Qa’ida (AQ), and reports suggest Azhar may have assisted AQ fight US forces in Somalia and helped to establish AQ training camps in Yemen.

JeM was banned by the Pakistan government in January 2002. Following the ban, JeM appears to have split into two factions, Khuddam ul -Islam (KuI) headed by Azhar and Jamaat ul -Furqan (JuF) headed by Maulana Abdul Jabbar (alias Umar Farooq). Both KuI and JuF were also subsequently banned by Pakistan in Novemb er 2003. Despite these factions, the group is commonly regarded as a single entity and referred to as JeM.

JeM has concentrated its efforts on the disputed territories of IAK, where it has conducted numerous attacks against Indian security forces (militar y and police), government installations, and civilians. While Indian and Pakistani initiatives to resolve the Kashmir situation have led to an overall reduction in the level of infiltration and insurgent activity since 2002, JeM continues to be one of the most active terrorist groups in IAK. For example, JeM claimed responsibility for the 2 November 2005 suicide car bomb attack in Srinagar that killed seven civilians, including a 10 -year -old boy, and three police officers. JeM operatives were among those re sponsible for a string of attacks in Srinagar on 14 April 2006, including a grenade attack on a crowd of civilians which killed three and injured eleven others. JeM members were responsible for a grenade attack on a police vehicle escorting a Human Rights Commission vehicle on 30 May 2006, and for a series of firearm attacks on police targets on 17 August 2006.

Attorney General News Release 6

While IAK remains JeM’s primary focus, elements within JeM have broadened the group’s focus to include the targeting of members of the Pakistani st ate and the Western presence in Pakistan. As members of a previously unknown group “Jundallah,” JeM trained members were among a number of militants drawn from several Pakistani extremist groups responsible for the twin car -bomb attack near the US Consulat e in Karachi on 26 May 2004. On 9 June 2004, the same terrorist cell was involved in a terrorist attack against a heavily -armed military convoy carrying Karachi’s military commander resulting in seven deaths. In August 2006, the Pakistan government ordered a crackdown on the JeM faction JuF following intelligence its members were planning to target Western interests in Pakistan. Members of JeM are also reported to have been involved in two assassination attempts against Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf in December 2003.

JeM operates a number of camps in Pakistan which provide both religious instruction and military style guerrilla training and support. Since being proscribed by the Pakistan government in 2002, some JeM training facilities are now small er in scale and focused on preparing jihadists for either low intensity, hit and run type operations or suicide attacks. Training and support is provided, not only to JeM members from Kashmir and Pakistan, but also to individual jihadists from other parts of the world. Suicide bomber Mohammad Bilal, a British national, travelled to Pakistan to volunteer for the JeM -directed suicide attack in IAK on 25 December 2000 which killed six Indian soldiers and three Kashmiri students. Reporting also indicates JeM ma y be helping to facilitate the activities of international jihadists intending to conduct terrorist operations outside Kashmir or India, including the United Kingdom. The British national, Rashid Rauf, arrested in Pakistan as one of the main coordinating f igures allegedly responsible for the disrupted British trans -Atlantic plane bombing plot in August 2006, is strongly suspected of having links with JeM. Investigators have also uncovered possible connections between JeM and the British -born suicide bomber s responsible for the 7 July 2005 London subway attacks.

Objectives JeM is a group that uses violence in pursuit of its stated objective of uniting IAK with Pakistan under a radical interpretation of Islamic law, as well as the “destruction” of America an d India.

Leadership and membership JeM’s founder, Maulana Masood Azhar, remains the group’s Amir. Reporting indicates that JeM has a strength of several hundred armed volunteers, but exact membership numbers cannot be accurately determined. The majority o f JeM’s membership consists of jihadists from Pakistan and Kashmir, but also includes some Arabs and Afghans. JeM has also attracted several recruits from South Asian communities in the United Kingdom.

JeM engagement in terrorist activities JeM has been i nvolved in a number of terrorist activities, including hijacking, bombings abductions, and training. Terrorist activities for which responsibility has been claimed by, or reliably attributed to, JeM, over the past three years include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ December 2003: At tempted assassination of Pakistani President Musharraf by car bomb;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 25 October 2004: Joint responsibility with HuM for a firearm attack on the motorcade of the Divisional Commissioner for the Muslim -Majority Kashmir Valley that injured one security gua rd;

Attorney General News Release 8

Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU)

(Also known as: Islamic Party of Turkestan, Islamic Movement of Turkestan)

The IMU is listed in the United Nations 1267 Committee’s consolidated list and as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the governments of the United Kingdom, United States and Canada.

Current status of the IMU The IMU formed in the late 1990s and is composed of Islamic extremists from Uzbekistan and other Central Asian states. It opposes the current Uzbek regime. The IMU’s area of operation includes U zbekistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Iran.

In 2001, the group announced that it had changed its name to the Islamic Party of Turkestan. The motivation for this is unclear, although it is probably intended to signal a change in emph asis from anti -Uzbek government activities to a wider radical Islamic agenda. The organisation has, however, continued to be known as the IMU.

On 11 September 2006 - the fifth anniversary of the coordinated attacks in the US -the IMU leadership renewed t heir commitment to attack the governments of Central Asia and issued personal threats against the Uzbek, Tajik and Kyrgyz Presidents. The statement reinforced the IMU leadership’s commitment to al -Qa’ida’s ideology of global jihad and continued anti -Wester n rhetoric.

The IMU has conducted terrorist attacks against civilian, government and foreign targets in Central Asia. The group’s tactics include hostage -taking (including foreigners), firearms attack and car bombings. The IMU conducted a bomb attack in June 2005 and in early 2006 was involved in armed attacks against a detention centre and customs and border posts. Kyrgyz and Tajik police operations in April, August and November 2006 discovered numerous weapons and supplies which were attributed to the IM U.

The IMU has close ties with al -Qa’ida and the former Taliban government. Senior IMU leaders have held positions in the al -Qa’ida hierarchy. The IMU receives funding from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, donations from sympathisers

and from al -Qa’ida.

The IMU continue to recruit fighters and IMU members fight alongside the Taliban and al -Qa’ida against coalition and Pakistani forces in Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. The Ferghana Valley, where the Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik borders converge , is a fertile recruiting ground for the IMU and the IMU has successfully exploited widespread poverty in its recruitment strategy.

IMU members have received training in camps in Afghanistan, some controlled by al -Qa’ida or the Taliban. IMU training camp s continue to exist in Pakistan and Afghanistan. IMU members have been trained in the use of small arms, poisons, explosives (including land mines) and religious ideology.

Despite the IMU’s losses in Afghanistan during the US intervention and the movement of fighters from the IMU to the Islamic Jihad Group (IJG) - an IMU splinter group - the group remains active and continues to have the capability and

Attorney General News Release 9

intent to conduct terrorist attacks.

Objectives The IMU’s initial objective was to overthrow the Uzbek r egime and replace it with an Islamic state. However, the IMU’s goals have broadened to include the establishment of a radical Islamic caliphate in Turkestan, an area stretching from the Caspian region to Xinjiang in western China.

Leadership and membershi p The IMU was founded by Tohir Yuldashev and Juma Namangani. Tahir Yoldashev is the IMU’s political and ideological leader. Military strategist Juma Namangani probably died fighting the US -led coalition in Afghanistan in 2001.

The IMU attracts support fro m a variety of ethnic backgrounds, principally Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Chechens and Uighurs from western China. Estimates of the membership of the IMU vary from 200 to 2000.

Terrorist activities Recent terrorist attacks and activities for which t he IMU has claimed responsibility or for which responsibility has been reliably attributed include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 31 January 2005: car bomb attack against the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the centre of Dushanbe, Tajikistan;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 12 June 2005: bomb attack again st the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Dushanbe, Tajikistan wounding twelve people;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 25 January 2006: armed attack on prison in an attempt to free a prisoner resulting in the death of the chief of the detention centre in Kairakum, Tajikistan; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 12 May 2006: IMU members were involved in armed attacks on border and customs posts in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

Islamic Army of Aden (IAA)

(Also known as: Aden Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA); Islamic Arm y of Aden Abayan ; Aden Islamic Army; Muhammed’s Army /Army of Mohammed; Jaish Adan al Islami )

Current status of the IAA

The IAA is a Sunni Islamic extremist group and was formed in 1996 as a splinter group of the Yemeni Islamic Jihad. The IAA first came to public prominence in 1998 when it issued statements detailing its intention to overthrow the Yemeni government and implement Sharia law; and called for operations against US and other Western interests in Yemen.

The IAA predominantly operates in the southern governates of Yemen - particularly Aden and Abya n. The IAA has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks against the Yemeni and Western interests. It has used bombings and kidnappings as a means of furthering its goals. In 1998, the IAA kidnapped 16 Western tourists. Four of the tourists, including an

Australian, were killed in a rescue attempt. The IAA also claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole on 12 October 2000.

The IAA is associated with al -Qa’ida and has made public statements in support of Usama bin Laden, al -Qa’ida and its terrorist activities.

Although current specific funding arrangements for the group are unknown, the IAA is believed to conduct criminal activities such as kidnapping as a means of raising money through ransom and to apply pressure to the Yem eni government. It may also have received some funding through al -Qa’ida.

Counter -terrorism operations by Yemeni authorities over the last few years have reduced the size of the group and limited its operational effectiveness. However, the IAA has not been deterred and there is no indication the intent of the IAA has changed. IAA members have

continued to be arrested, including the reported arrest of IAA members suspected of involvement in terrorist activities in Iraq. The involvement of the IAA in Iraq, and the possible return of IAA operatives to Yemen, as well as the group’s association with al -Qa’ida from which the IAA could draw on significant resources for future activities means that IAA could undertake terrorist activities if and when the opportuni ty arises.

Objectives

The IAA aims to overthrow the current Yemeni government and establish an Islamic state. More broadly, the IAA is committed to support al -Qa’ida’s global jihad.

Leadership and membership

The IAA’s founder and former leader Z ain al -Abid in al -Mihdar (aka Abu al -Hassan) was executed in 1999 for his role in the 1998 kidnappings of 16 Western tourists in Yemen. Al -Mihdar and other founding members were veterans of the struggle in Afghanistan against the Soviets. Khaled Abdennabi assumed lead ership of the IAA before surrendering to authorities in June 2003. In return for his cooperation Abdennabi received a Presidential pardon that same year. Abdennabi has since made statements on behalf of the group but it is unclear whether he is the current leader.

The current strength of the IAA is unknown , but is likely to be between 30 to 100 core members divided in to a number of small groups or cells .

IAA engagement in t errorist activities

Security operations by the Yemeni authorities have restricted th e IAA’s capabilities within Yemen. However, on the basis of available information, it is assessed that IAA operatives still exist in Yemen. It is assessed that the IAA will undertake terrorist activities if and when the

Attorney General News Release 11

opportunity arises. The group’s asso ciation with al -Qa’ida means the IAA could draw on significant resources for future activities.

Terrorist attacks and plans for terrorist attacks for which responsibility has been claimed by, or reliably attributed to, the IAA, have included:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Aug 2002: th ree Yemenis belonging to the IAA were convicted of carrying out bombing attacks in the southern port of Aden on 1 January 2001;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 21 Jun 2002: attack on a military medical convoy, injuring 7 soldiers;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Jun 2003: arrest of four alleged IAA members and seizure of a car packed with hand grenades, explosives and rocket -propelled grenades that had been used in the attack on a military medical convoy on 21 June 2003;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 25 Jun 2003: clash between IAA members and government troops at the group’s hideout in Harat - captu red IAA members revealed they were waiting for orders to carry out terrorist operations;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Oct 2003: a planned car bomb attack against the US, UK and German embassies in Sana’a allegedly involving the IAA was disrupted;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mar/Apr 2006: arrest of IAA members s uspected of planning to travel to Iraq to fight foreign forces.

Attorney General News Release 12

Statement of Reasons Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ)

(Also known as: El -Gihad; al -Jihad; Jihad Group; Islamic Jihad; Al -Jihad al -Islami; New Jihad Group; Qaeda al -Jihad; Talaa’al al -Fateh; Vang uards of Conquest; al -Takfir; World Justice Group; International Justice Group, Islamic Group ).

Current status of EIJ The EIJ emerged as a coalition of Sunni Islamic radical groups that split from the Muslim Brotherho od, an Egyptian Islamic political move ment, in the late 1970s. Following the EIJ’s assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981 , actions by the Egyptian authorities constrained its capability within Egypt.

During the 1990s, the domestic EIJ faction continued to carry out attacks ag ainst targets in Egypt . Meanwhile, senior EIJ member (now al -Qa’ida deputy) Dr Ayman al -Zawahiri and the international faction of EIJ forged links with al -Qa’ida and affiliated groups. In February 1998 the EIJ joined al -Qa’ida and other extremist organisat ions in issuing a declaration under the banner of the ‘World Islamic Front’ announcing a jihad against ‘Jews’ and ‘Crusaders’ and stating the US and its allies need to be expelled from the Middle East.

The EIJ exists as two factions - the international and the domestic. The international faction, led by al -Qa’ida deputy Ayman al -Zawahiri, is largely subsumed with in al -Qa’ida and has the same goals as that group. Terrorist activities by the EIJ international faction are likely credited to al -Qa’ida rather th an the EIJ. The domestic faction is mostly inactive due to successful, sustained actions by Egyptian authorities. There is no evidence that this has led to the creation of two separate organisations.

Objectives The EIJ aims to overthrow of the Egyptian Gov ernment and the establishment of an Islamic state . More broadly, the international branch has adopted the global jihadist goals of al -Qa’ida.

Leadership and Membership The leader of the domestic faction of EIJ is Abbud al -Zumar. Al -Zumar is currently in pr ison in Egypt .

EIJ’s spiritual leader is Omar Ahmed Abdul Rahman, an Egyptian cleric currently in prison in the US for his role in the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing .

Estimates of the size of the EIJ membership vary. It is estimated to have a core members hip of several hundred, with several thousand supporters .

EIJ engagement in terrorist activities Consistent with its primary goals, the EIJ initially conducted armed attacks against high -level Egyptian government personnel and Egyptian facilities. As the E IJ’s goals became intertwined with those of al -Qa’ida and the EIJ became frustrated with its inability to overthrow the Egyptian Government, the EIJ concentrated on attacks against Egyptian targets outside Egypt and US interests.

The Egyptian security and police services have been effective in reducing the operational capability of the EIJ in Egypt and attacks that can be reliably attributed to the group have declined. However, despite the reported merger of EIJ with al -Qa’ida , there is no indication the EI J ha s retreated from its objectives or has ceased terrorist activities. In October 2005 the US Government identified a several Egyptian nationals as EIJ members who had provided training and material support to al -Qa’ida. A statement in March 2006 attribut ed to the EIJ’s spiritual leader, Omar Ahmed Abdul Rahman expressed the anti -Egypt sentiment of the EIJ

Attorney General News Release 13

and called for jihad in seeking his release from US custody . Ayman al -Zawahiri remains a significant symbol and leader of global jihad and is still cons idered the leader of the international EIJ faction . On 27 July 2006, al -Zawahiri issued a video statement calling on Muslims to target the interests of “all the countries” who participated in the “assault against the Muslims” in countries including Afghani stan and Iraq, a reference taken to include Australia. In June 2006, EIJ member Abu Hamza al -Muhajir (also known as Abu Ayyub al -Masri), who had a senior position in al -Qa’ida , was appointed as leader of Tanzim Qa’idat al -Jihad fi Bilad al -Rafidayn (common ly known as al -Qa’ida in Iraq), following the death of Abu Musab al -Zarqawi .

Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the EIJ, including EIJ members active in the al -Qa’ida network, continue to have the capability and intent to conduct further terrorist attacks . It is assessed the EIJ is active internationally and it is likely EIJ will undertake attacks if and when the opportunity arises. The group's close association with al -Qa'ida means it could draw on significant resources for futur e activities.

Terrorist attacks and activities which have been claimed by or reliably attributed to EIJ include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Oct 1981: assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Aug 1993: attempted assassination of the Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan al -Alfi using a VBIED; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Nov 1993: attempted assassination of the Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Sikdi by vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED); Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Nov 1995: assassination of an Egyptian diplomat in Geneva;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Nov 1995: suicide truck -bomb attack against the Egyp tian embassy in Pakistan, killing 17 people; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1998: an attack against the US Embassy in Albania was disrupted.

Asbat al Ansar (AAA)

(Also known as: League of Partisans; Band of Partisans, Band of Helpers, League of the Followers, Partisans’ League , Usbat al -Ansar, Usbat ul -Ansar, Osbat al -Ansar, Isbat al -Ansar, Esbat al -Ansar).

AAA is listed in the United Nation’s 1267 Committee’s consolidated list and as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the governments of Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Current status of AAA AAA is a Sunni Muslim extremist group, largely based in the Ayn al -Hilwah Palestinian refugee camp near Sidon in southern Lebanon. The group has a smaller presence in the Nahr al -Bared camp outside Tripoli in northern Lebanon, and is also active in Sidon, Beirut and the Dinniyeh plateau in northern Lebanon.

AAA’s origins can be traced back to the late 1980s. The group became more widely known in the early 1990s following a series of attacks on nightclubs, thea tres and liquor stores.

Initially, AAA limited its operations to Lebanon and engaged in a number of low -level attacks against ‘un -Islamic’ targets. These have included bombings against churches, bars, theatres and casinos, as well Lebanese forces, element s of the Lebanese government and foreign nationals. AAA has widened its operations to conduct attacks against foreign interests in Lebanon and assassinations of significant religious leaders. AAA’s attack methods include rocket -propelled grenades, explosiv e charges, rockets and car bombs.

AAA maintains links to a number of terrorist organisations, including al -Qa’ida and Tanzim Qa’idat al -Jihad fi Bilad al Rafidayn (TQJBR). There is a view that AAA subscribes to bin Laden’s ideal of global jihad and is pla nning to extend its operations into Syria and Israel.

AAA remains active and has shifted its focus to Iraq, sending fighters in support of the insurgency in collaboration with al -Qa’ida. In 2005 and 2006, AAA announced the death or martyrdom of AAA member s fighting the ‘crusader’ forces in Iraq. Due to the activities of AAA and like -minded groups, Lebanon has increasingly become a known transport node and recruitment hub for extremists travelling to Iraq.

AAA leadership continues to make statements suppor ting attacks conducted by other groups and advocating violent jihad against the West, such as the April 2004 announcement urging Iraqi insurgents to kill Western hostages to avenge the death of Hamas leaders Abdul Aziz Rantisi and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and the February 2006 statement praising attacks by angry mobs against the Danish consulates in Beirut and Damascus in response to the Danish cartoons controversy.

AAA primarily receives funding from other terrorist organisations, such as al -Qa’ida.

Object ives AAA’s objectives are to establish a Sunni Islamic state in Lebanon by overthrowing the Lebanese government, eliminating Israel and thwarting anti -Islamic and pro -Western influences in Lebanon.

Attorney General News Release 15

Leadership and Membership AAA is led by Abu Muhjin (aka A hmed Abd al -Karim al -Saadi). Abu Muhjin allegedly fled Lebanon in 1999 to continue his activities in secret after being sentenced to death for the 1994 assassination of Sheikh Nizar al -Halabi, the leader of a rival Islamic extremist group. In his absence, Abu Muhjin’s brother, Haytham ‘Abd Al -Karim Al Sa’di (aka Abu Tariq), has been nominally leading the group.

AAA membership is primarily Palestinian. AAA’s membership is estimated to be 100 -300 members. AAA members have previously fought in Afghanistan, C hechnya, Kashmir and the Balkans.

AAA engagement in terrorist activities AAA continues to undertake attacks but is also assisting the doing of terrorist acts. On the basis of available information it is assessed AAA operatives are active in Lebanon and it is likely AAA will undertake attacks if and when the opportunity arises. The group's close association with al -Qa'ida means it could draw on significant resources for future activities.
