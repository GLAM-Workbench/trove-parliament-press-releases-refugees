MINISTERIAL STATFENT

By The Min is t e r for I mmigration and Ethnic Affa ir s, Mr I an Macphee

LILIANA JGASINSKAYA .

Fk Speaker

O n 26 February the Honourable member for Casey drew the attention

of the House to press reports of interviews with Mis s Lil ia n a

Gasinskaya in which i t  was claimed that she had retained her

So viet c it iz e n s h ip  and her So viet passport to travel overseas last

YEAR AND HAD VISITED HER PARENTS IN THE SOVIET UNION.

Bearing in  mind Miss G asinskaya' s claims in  1979 when she was

GRANTED REFUGEE STATUS ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE DETERMINATION OF

Refugee Status Committee that she held a well- founded fear of

PERSECUTION SHOULD SHE RETURN TO HER HOMELAND, I INSTRUCTED THE

Chairman of the DORS Committee to make enquiries into the reported

STATEMENTS IN THE PRESS AND ELSEWHERE.

Following t h is , o ffic ia ls conducted an extensive enquiry into Miss

Gasinskaya' s a c t iv it ie s  over the last year. Mis s Gasinskaya was

SUBSEQUENTLY INTERVIEWED ON TWO OCCASIONS. DURING THESE INTERVIEWS

MARKED INCONSISTENCIES IN HER VARIOUS ACCOUNTS OF HER OVERSEAS

V I S I T  EMERGED. .

De s p it e  t h e s e  in c o n s is t e n c ie s , my Dep a r tm e n t was a b le to

ESTA B LISH  BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THAT AT NO STAGE HAD SHE

V I S I T E D , T H E  S O V IE T  U N I O N  AND THAT SHE HAD NOT USED A

So v ie t  t r a v e l  d o c u m en t for a v i s i t  to Br i t a i n  l a s t y e a r .

Mis s  Ga s in s k a y a  t r a v e l l e d  to t h e Un it e d  King do m and r etu r n ed

of Fo r e ig n  Af f a ir s  for use by non c i t iz e n s  when t h e y

TRAVEL ABROAD.

I n it h e  f ir s t  in t e r v ie w  Mis s  Ga s in s k a y a  c l a im e d  t h a t  she had

NOT RETURNED TO THE S O V IE T  UNIONV BUT THAT SHE HAD V I S I T E D

HER MOTHER IN  LONDON. I n THE SECOND IN TE R V IEW  SHE ADM ITTED

THAT SHE HAS NOT SEEN HER MOTHER S IN C E  SHE A R R IV E D  IN  A

So v ie t  v e s s e l  in  Sy d n e y over two yea r s a g o. I n d e p e n d e n t

CHECKS BY MY DEPARTMENT HAVE CONFIRMED T H I S .

Ha v in g  e x a m in e d  a l l  t h e  e v id e n c e , th e DORS Co m m it t e e  has

ADVISED ME THAT -  .

" . . . T he Co m m it t e e  is  of t h e v ie w  t h a t , on t h e e v id e n c e

A V A IL A B L E , THERE ARE I N S U F F I C I E N T  GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION

However d u r in g  t h e s e  in t e r v ie w s  Mis s  Ga s in s k a y a  a d m it t e d

THAT SHE HAD A P P L IE D  TO THE S O V IE T  A U T H O R IT IE S  FOR THE

APPROPRIATE TR A V E L DOCUMENT V A L ID  FOR TRAVEL TO THE S O V IE T

Un i o n and r e t u r n. I am i n f o r m e d t h a t, i n d o i n g s o, she so ug ht

CERTAIN ASSURANCES FROM THE SOVIET AUTHORITIES. I n MAKING

THESE APPLICATIONS MlSS GASINSKAYA WAS NO DOUBT MOTIVATED BY

AN UNDERSTANDABLE DESIRE TO SEE HER FAMILY AGAIN. HER

APPLICATIONS HOWEVER RAISE NEW ISSUES, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

w h i c h Miss Ga s i n s k a y a  does  not appear  to c o m p r e h e n d .

I f her a p p l i c a t i o n  were to be gran ted  by the So v i e t

Au t h o r i t i e s  so t h a t  she a g a i n  became  a USSR c i t i z e n , Ar t i c l e

l . C  of t h e 1951 Geneva  Co n v e n t io n  on th e s t a t u s  of Refugees

WOULD APPLY:

"Th i s  Co n v e n t io n  s h a ll  cease  to a p p l y  to any person

FALLING UNDER THE TERMS OF SECTION A IF :

(1) He has v o l u n t a r i l y  r e- a v a i l e d  h i m s e l f  of t h e

(2 ) Ha v i n g  l o s t  h i s  n a t i o n a l i t y , he has v o l u n t a r i l y

REACQUIRED I T . . . "

For t h i s r e a s o n, t h e Co m m i t t e e  has a d v i s e d  me t h a t i t " i s

OF THE VIEW THAT THE QUESTION OF MlSS GASINSKAYA'S REFUGEE

STATUS SHOULD BE KEPT UNDER REVIEW.

Miss Ga s i n s k a y a  should  be c o u n s e ll e d  about  t h e s e r io u s n e s s

OF HER SITUATION AND THE POSSIBLE RESULTS OF ANY SUCH ACTION."

THROUGH OUT THE INVESTIGATION AND THE MOTIVES THAT MIGHT

LIE BEHIND.THEM. ÃÂªÃÂÃÂ INCONSISTENCIES IN HER VARIOUS

STATEMENTS HAVE CAUSED ME GREAT CONCERN AND HAVE LED ME TO

SCRUTINIZE ALL OF THESE INCONSISTENCIES MOST CAREFULLY.

Ha v i n g  done s o, I have come to the same c o n c l u s io n  as the

DORS Co m m it t e e , namely  t h a t  she has not breached  the Co n v e n t io n

UNDER WHICH SHE WAS GRANTED REFUGEE STATUS DESPITE THE FACT

THAT EVEN THE KINDEST CRITIC OF HER PUBLIC UTTERANCES WOULD

REGARD HER CONDUCT AS DISTURBING AND EXTRAORDINARY FOR A

RUFUGEE. I HAVE INSTRUCTED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DORS

Co m m it t e e  t h a t  she should  be c o u n s e ll e d  about  her s i t u a t i o n  and

THE PROSPECT THAT, SHOULD SHE PROCEED WITH HER APPLICATION AND

RE-ACQUIRE SOVIET C ITIZEN SHIP, SHE'WOULD COME WITHIN THE

terms  of Ar t i c l e  1 . C( 2 )  of the Geneva  Co n v e n t io n  and would

LOSE HER REFUGEE STATUS. .

To REGULARISE HER STATUS I HAVE DEC ID ED  THAT M lS S  GASINSKAYA   SHOULD BE G IVEN  A TEMPORARY ENTRY P E R M IT , W ITH PER M ISSIO N  TO

WORK, FOR A PERIOD OF S IX  MONTHS. T H IS  W IL L  ENABLE HER TO

CONSIDER HER P O S IT IO N  AND BE COUNSELLED BY MY DEPARTMENT ABOUT

THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER A C TIO N S . I f SHE PROCEEDS W ITH HER

A P P L IC A T IO N  TO THE S O V IE T  A U T H O R IT IE S  THEN SHE W IL L  DO SO IN

THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THAT MEANS IN  TERMS OF HER REFUGEE

AND R ESID EN T STATUS. I f SHE WITHDRAWS HER A P P L IC A T IO N S  OR SHOULD

THEY BE REFUSED BY THE S O V IE T A U T H O R IT IE S  THEN I WOULD BE

PREPARED TO CONSIDER AN A P P L IC A T IO N  FROM HER FOR THE RESTORATION

OF HER PERMANENT RESIDENCY.

IMPORTANT THAT REFUGEE STATUS SHOULD BE G IV E N  ONLY TO

SHE HAS TAKEN A CTIO N WHICH COULD LEAD TO A COURSE OF EVENTS

WHICH WOULD INVOLVE HER LOSING REFUGEE STATUS.

I B E L IE V E  THAT AS T H IS  MATTER WAS RAISED  IN  PARLIAMENT IT

IS  APPROPRIATE THAT I SHOULD RESPOND IN  PA R LIAM ENT. ÃÂªÃÂ ÃÂ

DELAY IS  MAKING T H IS  RESPONSE REFLECTS THE C O N F L IC T IN G

NATURE OF ASSERTIONS MADE BY M lSS GASINSKAYA AND THE

IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUES R A IS E D  BY A CONSEQUENCE.
