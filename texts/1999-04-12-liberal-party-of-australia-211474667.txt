OPEN LETTER TO ALL MEDIA OUTLETS

REGARDING REFUGEES

Â

12 April 1999

Â

To Whom It May Concern

Â

The tragic events in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and recent 
arrivals of ve ssels harboring unlawful arrivals have generated 
considerable media attention and reporting.

Â

Throughout this reporting the descriptive ‘refugee’ 
has been widely applied -sometimes appropriately, and unfortunately, 
frequently not.

Â

The United Nations Convention relating to the status 
of refugees defines a refugee as someone who is:

Â

Â· Â outside their country of nationality 
or usual country of residence and

Â

Â· Â is unable or unwilling to return or to seek the protection 
of that country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons 
of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, 
or political opinion.

Â

To compare the plight of often traumatised and desperate people with 
those who may arrive on our shores clandestinely seeking m igration 
outcomes or work opportunities is entirely inappropriate.

Â

As an example, the occupants of the vessel that beached 
at Holloway’s Beach North of Cairns in March were not, despite the 
loose application of the term by many media outlets, refugees.

Â

Such people are more accurately described as unlawful 
arrivals, or as they are frequently euphemistically referred to, ‘boat-people’.

Â

Furthermore, people who apply to the Government of 
a country for recognition as a refugee are asylum seekers, pending determination 
of their claims.

Â

While this clarification may seem trivial, it is crucial 
that this term, with the very special and it conveys, is correctly applied. 
I would appreciate your assistance in this endeavour.

Â

Kind regards

Â

Philip Ruddock
