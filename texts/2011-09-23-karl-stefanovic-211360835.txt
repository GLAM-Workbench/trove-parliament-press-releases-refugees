E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, on a beautiful morning where you are this morning, let’s get straight into it and according to the  Coalition Senator Nigel Scullion, Kevin Rudd is counting the numbers and he’s just nine shy of a return to  the Lodge. Is he making it up, stretching the truth?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, something is going on, Karl. It’s hard to know exactly what but something is going on. The Labor  Party is very skittish. They’re divided and directionless and as long as you’ve got a divided and directionless  government, you’ve got a whole lot of problems in the country that aren’t being addressed.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Is Senator Nigel Scullion standing by those statements, though?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I understand he is but the real point is we have a divided and directionless government which is not  addressing our problems. This Government, let’s face it Karl, lost its way back in 2008 on border protection  and as soon as the Government lost its way the people smugglers found theirs and the Government was  certainly incapable of dealing with this issue in the parliament this week.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, Graham Richardson has come out in The Australian today and he reckons that there are 20 MPs that  are behind Kevin Rudd as it stands this morning. It’s still not enough, though.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ll leave Graham Richardson and others to comment on the Labor Party. I just think that as far as the  Australian people are concerned the Government has got to get on with the job and this is a government  which just seems to be wallowing in introspection, naval-gazing and despair at its own prospects.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

According to the latest polls, or the polls in general, you’d have a tougher time facing Kevin Rudd. I guess  in some respects you’ve got to be careful what you wish for?

TONY ABBOTT:

Karl look, it’s Labor’s policies that are the problem. They could change their leader but unless they change  their policy it’s not going to help them. They haven’t stopped the boats. They are going to clobber  consumers and workers with a carbon tax. It just gets worse and worse where this Government is concerned.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Do you have anything solid on a possible change of leadership, apart from what your senator has found out?  Is there anything real there, anything that you can quantify, or is it just all a little bit hypothetical?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, Karl, all I know is that it is a very skittish parliamentary Labor Party right now, that’s all I know;  and when you’ve got a divided and directionless government you have people who wonder what’s going to  happen to their future because what they have a right to expect is a government they can trust and that’s not  what they’ve got at the moment.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. Your refusal to accept the Government’s amendments to the Migration Act could see an end to  offshore processing altogether. Is that really what you want?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, we support offshore processing and the Government can have its legislation through the parliament in a  twinkling if it accepts our amendment which will make the law more certain and more safe. We support  offshore processing, Karl. We invented it, we’ve got the patent on it but it’s got to be the right offshore  processing, not the wrong one.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

It looks like Rob Oakeshott may ride to the Government’s rescue. If they do carry it, will you keep fighting  against the Malaysia solution or will it be time to pick up your stumps and go home?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s just a bad deal, Karl. It’s a bad deal for Australia, it’s a cruel deal for boat people and it’s a dud  deal for everyone because it hasn’t worked. Since it was first announced there’s been 1,000 boat people  arrive. Since it was signed there’s been 400 boat people arrive. Once the 801st gets here there’s no deal

anymore. So, this is not the way to protect the borders. You’ve got a proven success with Nauru or a proven  failure with Malaysia.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

What happens when Nauru fills up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that what you’ve got to have, Karl, is a range of policies and we’ve never said that Nauru on its  own would be enough. We’ve said that you need Nauru, temporary protection visas and the option of  turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. For the Australian people, Karl, the question is: who do you  trust? Do you trust the Coalition that stopped the boats or the Labor Party which started them up again?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Now just moving on, we are in - as you know very well - AFL heartland this morning and there are all sorts  of rumours around this township today and across Victoria in fact that the governing body looks likely to  come out against poker machine reform which would be significant news. What do you think that will mean  overall?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that mandatory pre-commitment is going to be expensive and ineffective, so it’s not supported  by the Coalition. It’s really up to the AFL what they decide to say, if anything, about the pokie tax but I  think it’s important that we accept the role that these great clubs play in our social fabric and I think it’s  typical of the Labor Party that it would put, in some respects, our social fabric at risk for its own political  advantage.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. On the subject of AFL, the preliminary finals, I’m going to get your pick before we move on with  the programme. Firstly, the Cats versus West Coast. Who is going to win, Tony Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m going to go for Geelong. I have to go for Geelong, don’t I?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Safe bet, he’s gone Geelong everyone. Alright, that’s predictable. Hey, what about Collingwood versus  Hawthorn?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Collingwood are a very strong team and I think they’ll be too strong for Hawthorn.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, going with the numbers again there Mr Abbott and just finally, in the rugby league, my beloved  Broncos versus Manly. Broncos the big winner in this one, yeah?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m going to disappoint you Karl, I’m sorry. I’m going to go for Manly Warringah. Here I am in  Queenscliff. Of course I’m going for Manly!

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Oh, very big problems between us, Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m sorry about that mate. No man hug this morning!

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Nope, not happening. See you soon, Tony. Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ll resume the bromance next week!
