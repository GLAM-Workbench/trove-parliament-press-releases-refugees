JOHN LAWS:



Immigration Minister Peter Dutton joins me on the line. Minister good morning and  welcome to the programme again.

PETER DUTTON:

Morning Lawsy, good to be back.

JOHN LAWS:



Okay good to talk to you. What prompted this crackdown Peter?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think we just got to the point John where we tried to work with these people as  closely as we could. We put options to them to return back to Nauru or back to  Manus where they've come from or indeed back to their country of origin. They  refused that and we found that in the cases that we're dealing with - so 400 in total,  we're just talking about the first 60 or 70 now - but 400 people in total who have  come from Manus or Nauru for medical assistance; the condition of them coming  here was that, okay the doctor said they needed to come here for medical  assistance, but that you would return, agree to return back to Nauru or Manus when  the medical support had been provided.

What happened was the lawyers worked with many of these people, they injuncted  us in the courts, preventing us from returning these people back to Nauru or Manus  and it's costing the taxpayers literally millions and millions of dollars a year and we  just got to the point where it was unacceptable. I'm responsible for spending  taxpayers' money and in good conscience I couldn't say that we were doing the right  and that's why we've clamped down.

JOHN LAWS:



I believe there's about 70 men that your Department has placed on final departure  bridging visas. Now what the hell does that mean?

PETER DUTTON:

Well it means that they don't any longer get Government assistance. So people will  know pensioners for example get a supplement each week or each fortnight to help  them toward their rent. So they need to pick up the balance of the rent that they pay  if they're in a rental property and the assistance provided to these people includes  accommodation - so that is the rent paid for in full - they're out in the community and  we’ve said no that we don't think it's acceptable that people are getting that level of  assistance.

So they go onto a bridging visa where they do have work rights, so they can work  and we stopped the welfare payments that were going. We still provide support  through Medicare and if they've got kids of school age then the ability to go to  school. So we provide assistance in that regard and I think we're generous in that  sense, but as I say we're not going to be taken for a ride and we're not going to allow  taxpayers to be taken for a ride.

Don't forget that these people are part of the 50,000 people who came on the 800  boats when Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were in control and we've not had a  successful boat now in well over 1,000 days.

So we've been able to stop the drownings at sea, we've got all the kids out of  detention, but what's been amazing in the last 24 hours to be honest is that Bill  Shorten's come out to say that he disagrees with what we're doing. He thinks that  they should be staying here and get the full government assistance and that  somehow they're going to move something in Parliament next week with the Greens,  which I think would stagger most Australians that Mr Shorten would take such a  view.

JOHN LAWS:



I'm surprised I've got to say. I really am surprised. If they work and support  themselves, are they allowed to stay then or will you deport them regardless?

PETER DUTTON:

No they're still obliged to go John. So we've been very clear in saying that if you've  sought to come by boat you won't settle here in our country.

We have a very compassionate refugee intake each year, but we do it the right way  - that is we bring people on planes after we've done the security checks, the health  checks, we can verify their stories and their identities and people turning up on  boats, having disposed of their identity cards or refusing to say in some cases why  they're owed protection, those days are gone.

The difficulty is that whilst this issue's out of people's minds, because the boats  aren't turning up each day, the reality is that the people smugglers are still there in  Indonesia and Sri Lanka and Vietnam and they would get back into business  tomorrow if they were given the opportunity.

So that's why I think it's alarming to hear Mr Shorten's comments because that really  gives a green light to people smugglers to say, ‘ah ha, we found a way through this  ring of steel, you can go to Australia for medical assistance and then you'll stay  there.’ It's a bad message and that's why the Government's been very clear in saying  that once they've been given the medical assistance then they are required to go  back.

It's worth pointing out too John that in many of the cases of the 400, it wasn't actually  that person that required medical assistance; they've come here as support for a  family member, they haven't been ill themselves and even in those cases the  lawyers have taken action in the High Court to prevent us from sending those people  back. So I just think we've already…the 50,000 and 800 boats has already cost this  country $14 billion and it's still costing us almost $2 billion a year to clean up this  mess and I want it to come to an end as quickly as possible.

JOHN LAWS:



They are really literally rorting the system, aren't they? If they send a friend along as  a supposed carer and then the carer stays as well, I mean it's a rort, an out and out  rort.

PETER DUTTON:

It is and we've brought it to an end and sadly, the reality is, that some people were  harming themselves in an effort to get to Australia and that's been the reality. When I  stopped the carers from coming or only provided one support member per patient to  come, then really we've seen a massive reduction in the number of self-harms as  well and medical incidents and that stream of people coming has really dried up.

But in the interim there are 400 people who are here at the moment and these single  males, many of them from Iran for example - a country that says if these people  don't want to go back voluntarily they won't take them back, so they won't issue  travel documents - and this is the legacy that we're dealing with.

If the boats started again tomorrow, well detention centres would reopen, the chaotic  scenes you would see at sea - it seems to me that Bill Shorten hasn't learnt any  lesson at all from Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard's mistakes and it would be a disaster  for this country if the boats recommenced because as we know 1,200 people  drowned at sea and 8,000 children were put into detention.

JOHN LAWS:



It was a real mess the boat thing. I mean how could anybody allow that to happen  again?

PETER DUTTON:

Well particularly when you've got the advice and it's very clear to me John the advice  and the intelligence that you receive that these people smugglers haven't gone  away. They're organised criminals, they're trading in drugs and gun parts and  prostitutes and the rest of it. They're unsavoury characters obviously and the people  smuggling - that is just putting people on boats - is just another business line for  them and so they go dormant in this area when the government clamps down and  they ramp up in the other area of their business.

So if they think that there's a new Australian Government and that the prime minister,  if it was to be Bill Shorten, after the election was going weak, well, I can tell you  they'd have thousands of people lined up at docks ready to go - and had the 31  boats got through that we've turned back over the last three years, it's very clear to  me on all of the advice that there would have been thousands of people who  followed and again that tragedy would still be playing out - as we're seeing in the  Mediterranean, this problem's not going away.

JOHN LAWS:



Yeah, terrible there, terrible there. I mean they're drowning in the Mediterranean -  they're getting onto boats that don't float.

PETER DUTTON:

And that was the experience here. I mean people were drowning. As we say, 1,200  that we knew of drowned on Labor's watch and why they would want to return to  those days…

They're talking about a stunt in Parliament next week with the Greens; the Labor  Party joining up with the Greens to try and move some motion to stop us from taking  this free housing away and stopping the welfare support to these people, which as I  say is just quite unbelievable, but no doubt Mr Shorten can explain their logic to it,  but it is a worrying step because Labor had tried to make us believe up until now that  their policy was the same as the Liberal Party and clearly it's not.

JOHN LAWS:



What is the status of our deal with America in regards to resettling refugees from  Nauru and Manus?

PETER DUTTON:

Well the deal is around 1,200 people or so John. So the US has agreed to take  people. They've been screening and their programme year - that is their new year if  you like of taking people into their refugee programme - starts on 1 October. So we  hope to have people moved as quickly as possible because again I mean this  Government didn't put people on Manus or Nauru, but our job is to clean the mess  up and get them off.

So when you have people like the Iranians who won't go back, refuse to go back and  their government refuses to allow them back, then you need to try and find third  country settlements. Malcolm Turnbull made this arrangement with President Obama  and President Trump is honouring it and we're very appreciative of that. So we will  have those people moving and as quickly as possible, but most likely not until  October at the earliest.

JOHN LAWS:



Peter what's your take on this dual citizenship garbage?

PETER DUTTON:

I just think John when you've got people who can't afford to turn on their heaters or  air conditioners this summer that people are worrying - why are we concerned with  these issues when there are more important issues to deal with like that? So it's a  technicality.

Barnaby Joyce was born here in Australia, he is loyal to our country, the thought that  he would be some spy or double agent if that was the import I mean he hasn't been  a very good one if that's been his role.

So I just think hopefully the court deals with it as quickly as possible and it allows us  to get back to business because there's a lot of good that the Government's doing.  Yes, we're frustrated by the Senate and Labor's playing games there with the  Greens, but there's a lot that we're getting through and the success that we've had  on national security, I mean those guys almost got onto that plane a few weeks ago  with a bomb so…

JOHN LAWS:



…yes almost.

PETER DUTTON:

So, very, very close. So all of that good work that we're doing behind the scenes is  overshadowed by the theatre of the Senate and the citizenship issues. So I think we  just need to move on from that.

As the Prime Minister demonstrates, I mean today he's doing more and this week  he’s doing more with energy companies and trying to reduce the power prices and  you get crazy situations like in Victoria where state governments are adopting these  policies that are going to drive up the prices of electricity, so we're trying to counter  that as well. So it's a distraction from that, but hopefully it's dealt with quickly and we  can all get back to the main business.

JOHN LAWS:



Yep well it'd be good if we could Peter. Thank you very much for your time yet again.  I've enjoyed talking to you and I'm sure we'll get to talk again.
