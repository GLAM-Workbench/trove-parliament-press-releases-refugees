Harsh and Heartless rewarded in Reshuffle

International Law Breaker Made Chief Law Maker



The Prime Minister has rewarded the harsh and heartless in his reshuffle,  Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

"While asylum seekers will no doubt be happy to see the back of Mr Ruddock,  the fact that he has apparently been rewarded after steering Australia through  one of the most shameful periods in our history will shock many Australians,"  Senator Brown said.



"The Governments' refusal to allow the Tampa to dock, the removal of Christmas  Island from Australia's migration zone, the Pacific solution and the continued  mandatory detention of asylum seekers involves a catalogue of international law  breaking that Mr Ruddock will carry forever.

"He put Pauline Hanson's proscriptions into practice tarnishing Australia's human  rights reputation around the world.

"International asylum seeker law, and Indigenous law, has been serially flouted  by Mr Ruddock.  The Prime Minister's decision to promote him to chief law maker  is galling.

"I hope Senator Vanstone shows more humanity to asylum seekers than she has  to Australia's pensioners and unemployed.

"Mr Abbott's elevation is pivotal to further privatisation of Australia's worlds-best  public health system.  This government's direction is to privatising both health  and education and Mr Abbott's job is to accelerate that progress.

"Mr Tuckey's departure is welcome but he should have gone long ago.

"The Greens will take the Howard Government head-on with much more  humanitarian policies as we head to an early election," Senator Brown said.
