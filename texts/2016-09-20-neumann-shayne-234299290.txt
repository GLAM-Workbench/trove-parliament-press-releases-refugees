DUTTON CAN’T AFFORD TO FAIL ON THE WORLD STAGE

Peter Dutton and Malcolm Turnbull cannot afford to fail on the world stage as the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees calls on Australia to ‘find solutions’ for those  residing in the offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru. The  Government has had three years, but has failed to secure viable third country  resettlement options for individuals in the centres.

After grandstanding on the world stage, Peter Dutton cannot come back to Australia  without a clear plan to resettle the people who are currently living in the Australian  funded offshore detention centres, and to provide them with a future other than  indefinite detention.

Labor remains committed to a combination of measures, including offshore processing  and turning back boats to prevent people smugglers from exploiting vulnerable people.

Peter Dutton’s inability to secure resettlement options has increasingly placed offshore  processing arrangements at risk, with the Papua New Guinea Government announcing  that the Manus centre must close and now, with reports that Connect Settlement  Services will join other major contracting firms in not seeking renewal of contracts, the  centre on Nauru risks being left with no service providers to operate it. Peter Dutton’s  time to deliver on a future for those in the centres is fast running out.

Labor calls on the Turnbull Government to also commit to do its part by increasing  Australia’s humanitarian intake to 27,000 a year by 2025 in line will Labor’s pre-election  commitment.

Coming back to Australia without confirmed third country arrangements and a  commitment to increase Australia’s humanitarian intake would be a failure for the  Turnbull Government on the world stage.
