"ASKING FOR FOOD IS A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE"

"The absolute degradation felt by people who have to swallow their  pride and go to an agency and beg for assistance is something most  of us in this country know nothing about."

"Advance Australia - On a Food Voucher)  - Victorian Emergency  Relief Project released this month.

That approximately 80% of them are pensioners and beneficiaries,  points up the inadequacy of social security payments, particularly  for the three most frequent client groups - unemployment beneficiaries  (28.2%), supporting parent beneficiaries (16.5%) and invalid

pensioners (15.3%). They make up 60% of the total contacts.

12% of people seeking emergency aid had no income when they sought  assistance. Most of them (60.6%) were waiting for a payment from  the Department of Social Security. '

Compared with a similar, though less detailed, report in 1978 the  number of unemployed contacts, particularly the single unemployed,   had increased considerably.. Supporting parents remain the most  over-represented group of social security claimants.

Since 1978 the proportion of people who contacted emergency relief  agencies themselves - without referral - had increased from 43.7%  to 74.1%.

V.C.O.S.S. is the only State body which has been funded by the  Department of Social Security to conduct a survey into emergency  relief clients. The findings are, however, consistent with.those  of the Smith Family in New South Wales which, using similar  classifications, established that, in the second half of 1980, 78.6%

of their contacts in New South Wales and the A.C.T. were pensioners  and beneficiaries.

The Report provides overwhelming evidence from the figures and  case studies of individual agencies and from aggregate figures of Â·   all the participating agencies of a vastly increased demand, coupled  with a reduced ability to give worthwhile aid to people "'coming for help

The Social Worker of the Salvation Army Spring Street Centre, Captain  Colin Berris, claimed an increase of 135% in interviews between  1979 and 1981, while available funds have increased by only  40%. In the same period, the average value of a food voucher was

$16.25. It is now down to $10 for a family, $5 for an individual.

"Captain Berris denies that people's problems are  caused by imprudent financial management rather than  .  inadequate benefit levels. I sit here day after day .

trying to balance people's budgets and I see they  cannot survive on the benefits. It would probably  be all right if they did not have to pay g a s ,  electricity

bonds, and buy shoes and clothing for their children.. Senator Chaney should ask himself how much does it cost  to feed, clothe and house three children". (The Age 16.4.82)

The Opposition has produced many tables showing how social security  payments have dropped below the poverty line. In March 1982:-

.  .2 .

ÃÂ' -2-

. a single invalid pensioner received a pension of

$69.70 a week $8.60 below the poverty line;

.  a supporting parent with three children received benefit and family allowance payments of $125.17 a week -  $35.33 belov^ the poverty line;

.  an unemployed breadwinner with dependent spouse and three  children receives $147.73 a week - $42.07 below the  poverty line;

.  a single unemployed person over 18 receives $58.10 a week -

$20.20 below the poverty line; and ‘

.  a single unemployed person under 18 receives $36 a week -

$42.30 a week below the poverty line.

Indexing these pensions and benefits - and the single unemployment  benefit is not indexed - only closes the gap produced by a 4-month  delay in catching up with cost of living rises. It does nothing to

overcome their financial disadvantage, present or relative.  This  can only be remedied if there is a concerted policy initiative to  upgrade basic pensions and benefits, payments on behalf of children,  and an end to discrimination against the unemployed.

Even these fundamental, albeit costly, changes would not do away  with the need for emergency aid. However, we would expect them to  diminish the need for continuing topping up of inadequate income  security payments. This would leave the traditional agencies

performing their relief and counselling roles for clients in  unexpected crisis situations.

The Labor Party accepts that the Commonwealth has the constitutional  obligation to provide income security, and we would accept that this  means at an adequate level.

Some of the Victorian^onganisations which have been under fearful  pressure have indicated that they believe Commonwealth responsibility  includes emergency relief. The agencies want to withdraw,.from  dispensing it, leaving all cash payments to the Commonwealth. .

Â·  ' t

Merle Mitchell of the Springvale Community Aid and Advice Bureau  has even suggested that if Federal M.P.s had to distribute welfare  payments, ' ]

"They might discover what it is like to tell a woman  with three children that she can only have $10 for  food this week". (Australian 23.9.80)

While sympathising with this exasperated attempt to shake the  Government out of its apathy towards the poor and desperate, the  Opposition does not see an expensive duplication of existing aid  services within a Commonwealth bureaucracy as a substitute for the  accessible and personalised service which most agencies give. .

The Commonwealth should rather have discussions with aid agencies  centring on the needs of clients,  the resources, standards and  accountability of organisations. In 1980 the Victorian Emergency  Relief Committee suggested criteria which agencies should-adopt in

their delivery of cash and in-kind aid to clients. They make a  valuable starting point.

The Fraser Government has given an additional $420,000 in each of  the last two years for emergency relief - less than 4% of the outlays.  Senator Chaney hate been cool to this program and, in expressing a  wish to simplify welfare services, has said:

"To take a small in volume but a specific example,  the field of emergency relief. Now that's been  well looked after by the Voluntary agencies and by  the States for many, many years in Australia. Quite

recently, just a few years a g o , the Commonwealth has  entered the field with grants, annual grants in the  order of half a million dollars which is really a  tiny proportion of the total effort in that field. Now I think the addition of the Commonwealth to the  mix has really just served to confuse the issue as to  .  just where responsibility for emergency relief lies

and that's an area I think needs some attention .

from government to make sure-that the people who are  in need in emergency relief aren't left lamenting while  the governments try to sort out who's responsible". (A . M . 11.12.80) '

I hope that after reading 1  Emergency Relief in Victoria1  Senator  Chaney will reassess the Commonwealth's role and make strong  representations to Cabinet on behalf of people on social security  payments and other low income earners. They are the people Merle  Mitchell sees, and of whom she says:

"When they come to this agency and say they haven't  got enough money for food - that's begging. For  many, just coming here and asking for food is a traumatic  experience". .

For how long will Australians allow other Australians to Ib-e put  through that experience? .

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION * ;

The Commonwealth Freedom of Information Bill was introduced in 1978.  More than three years and several re-drafts later, it went through  Parliament last February.

On 25th February, Senator Durack said he expected the legislation  to be implemented on 1st July. He has now set 1st October as the

target date.

The application of Freedom of Information is of particular interest  to welfare organisations and pensioners and beneficiaries whose  income depends on decisions taken in the Department of Social Security.

As for all Departments and prescribed authorities, Clause 11 of the  Freedom of Information Act confers on every person a legally  enforceable right to obtain access to the documents of the  Department of Social Security, other than exempt documents.

The most likely category of exempt documents are:- .

(a) documents affecting enforcement of the law; (b)  documents to which secrecy provisions of enactments apply; (c) documents affecting personal privacy;

(d) documents affecting legal proceedings or subject to legal  professional privilege; and

-4-

(e) documents containing material obtained in confidence.

There is also a rough classification of 'internal working documents'  which has still to be defined. In general, factual documents on  policy issues can be made available, but not advice and policy  option papers. .

*

Documents available will generally be those produced after the  enactment of the freedom of information legislation, but earlier  documents that are necessary to have an understanding of present or  future documents can be requested.

Personal documents up to five years old can be requested. Any  individual who believes the Department of Social Security or  another department is holding personal information which is  inaccurate, out of date or misleading, can apply to have that  amended. .  .

There are procedures for challenging the Department's claim that  specified documents are exempt.

The Department has 60 days within,which to answer a request for  information. Then an application can be made for an internal  review - that is, it will be reassessed by another more senior,  officer. If this is refused, an appeal can be made to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal. .

A general Freedom of Information Manual’  should be available in  September from the Attorney-General's Department.

The Department of Social Security has been given a year before it  must publish, all its manuals of instruction and precedents.

The charges for search and production of documents have yet to be  determined by Cabinet.

It is important that agencies, Parliamentary Members, and pensioner  groups,familiarise themselves as soon as possible with the  legislation, making -particular requests about its workings to  the Attorney-General's and Social Security Departments.

The Freedom of Information provisions should even now be of help  to the Invalid Pension Campaign. ‘

At present applicants rejected, for invalid pension have n o ‘access  to the reports which have determined they are ineligible unless  and until, probably after, waiting a year for their appeal to go to.  the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Now they should have reasons  and documentation within 60 days or soon after, with opportunity  to amend incorrect information.

It is also a process in changing the Department's attitude, for  all will recall the high-handed approach of the previous Director-  General who wrote on 30.9.80 in relation to the invalid pension changes:

"It is no concern of ACOSS.... if I give an administrative

direction to members of this Department to set up task  forces to review procedures."

As the Canberra Times put it:-

"That argument is over, and secretive bureaucracy lost".

* A very detailed explanation of the Act's provisions can be found  in the Legal Services Bulletin (April 1982)

GOVERNMENT SAVES ON FAMILY ALLOWANCES

Senator Chaney has given figures which show how much families are  losing because family allowances are not indexed.

(Hansard 21.4.82)

Senator Chaney in a separate answer estimated that if family allowance  payments had been indexed with the CPI from their introduction in  1976, the expenditure in 1981-82 would have been $1,570 m i l l i o n , that is  $530 million more than this year's estimate of $1,040 million.

On 28th April 1982, despite the opposition of every Government Senator, the  Senate passed the following amendment to the Customs Tariff Amendment  Bill 1982: .  .

The Senate:-(1) .expresses its concern that the customs duties imposed by this Bill in relation-to wheelchairs will maintain the Â»   high cost of these necessary aids for the disabled, and

(2) calls upon the Government immediately to review its '  Ã¢ÂÂ

decision in relation to wheelchairs with a view to  replacing the tariff arrangements provided in the Bill with a bounty scheme for local producers".

The amendment was moved by the Labor Party with the support of the  Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. .

It made no immediate difference to the passing of the Bill. However,  the fact that there is such strong support in the Senate is an

invitation to disabled people to redouble their efforts to force the  Government to remove the tariff on essential aids.

WEALTH INQUIRY PROPOSED

The Labor Party cbmmitment to end poverty in Australia requires a  complementary commitment to assess the accumulation of wealth and  capital and then take appropriate a c tion.

As a first step* Mr. Ralph Jacobi M.P., has proposed to Parliament:

"That a joint select committee be appointed to inquire into and  report on:

(a) the existing distribution of personal income and wealth in  Australia and past trends in that distribution, the term  'wealth1  for the purposes of the inquiry to include earned  income of all types, fringe and non-monetary benefits;

unearned income of all types; capital gains, and all forms  of personal wealth;

(b) the extent of growth of tax avoidance and evasion including

(i) the effects of this on the distribution of  post-tax income; and .

(ii) methods of strengthening powers available to  .  the Parliament, the Taxation Office, and the .  judiciary to stop tax avoidance and evasion so

as to increase the equity of the post-tax income  distribution; ’

(c) the recommendations made in reports by the Taxation Review  Committee, t h e 'Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and the  Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation,.and the  desirability of legislation being enacted to implement

the recommendations."

Readers of the Bulletin who wish to endorse this A.L.P. initiative  should make their views known to Government Members and in addition,  Australian Democrat Senators and Senator Harradine. Â»

COST OF 'DISADVANTAGED' CARDS '  ( i )

A Labor Health Plan,.  by eliminating the 1  disadvantaged'  health care card,  would have the satisfying effect of stopping the $3.18 million currently  spent on printing, processing and posting out the cards.

Senator Chaney, .in reply to a Question on Notice said: - :

"It is estimated that approximately nine million health care cards for  unemployment and special benefit beneficiaries and 300,000 health care  cards for migrants and low income earners will be issued by my  Department in a full year.

The estimate cost is:

(i) supplies of printed stationery - $48,500

(ii) processing of 300,000 claims for health care cards - $800,000

(iii) postage charges - $2,232,000 "
