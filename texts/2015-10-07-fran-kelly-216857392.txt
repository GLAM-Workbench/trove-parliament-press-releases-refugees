TREASURER SCOTT MORRISON MP   7 October 2015

Interview with Fran Kelly, Breakfast, ABC Radio  National  SUBJECTS: OECD Report Supports Australian Government Action on  Multinational Tax Avoidance, providing real opportunities for  Australians who want to work, save and invest, superannuation,  industrial relations, immigration portfolio

FRAN KELLY:

Scott Morrison welcome to Breakfast.

TREASURER:

Hi Fran, good to be here with you in Sydney.

KELLY:

These OECD recommendations to stop corporate tax avoidance have largely been  welcomed by the tax experts as we have just heard. But some say they don’t go far  enough in terms of providing greater transparency of what is going on within  companies, that will help the top companies keep cheating on tax. Do you think these  rules are good enough, are strong enough?

TREASURER:

Well they are the product of more than two years of work - international work by  more than 60 countries and Australia played a very central role in that and  particularly the former Treasurer, Joe Hockey, played a very important role as the  Chair of Finance Ministers as part of the G20. You have got to be very careful how  you calibrate these initiatives, it is not something you take a blunt instrument to  because the consequences for a country like Australia where you can potentially put  up the cost of people doing business in Australia if you get this wrong and the impact  on jobs and investment, is very serious. So I think this is a very good package, it has  been well consulted upon and Australia is already well ahead of where this package  was brought down on. We had the laws introduced in September which do crack  down on multinational tax avoidance, does introduce the country by country  reporting, does increase very tough penalties for those who are found not to be  paying their fair share of tax.

KELLY:

Well when is it going to work though because as you say Australia now has some of  the strongest tax integrity rules in the world and there was some criticism for  Australia going out ahead of the rest of the world and this agreement? But a third of  our biggest companies here pay less than 10 cents in the dollar, when will they start  paying their proper tax liabilities?

TREASURER:

Well we already have 30 companies which the tax office has already been working  with and had people imbedded there working through the various arrangements they  have to ensure that these companies are paying their fair share of tax. I will be  making an announcement later today with the Tax Commissioner and giving an  update on where we are at with the progress of those initiatives. We have been able to  identify additional companies as a result of the legislation that we introduced in the  Parliament recently. So we already are getting results but everything on the thin  capitalisation rules which is another controversial topic but we have the best thin  capitalisation rules I believe going around and they are entirely consistent with what  the OECD has recommended. The Opposition has put an alternative to that and the  great risk and the advice I have of that approach is it will impact on jobs and  investment, it does go too far, it isn’t flexible enough and we need to make sure that  we don’t take blunt instruments. Now my offer to the Opposition is pretty  straightforward, we would be pleased to look at what they are proposing but they  would have to provide their assumptions and their modelling so the Treasury can  properly understand it. As we understand it currently what they are proposing could  really risk jobs and investment in Australia because it is too much of a blunt  approach.

KELLY:

Yes but flexibility can also mean loopholes, the tax forgone in the decade to 2013 was  about $80 billion we know. The recent Senate enquiry heard that Apple for example  paid just $80 million in tax in this country on sales of $6 billion. Will big  multinationals like Apple, Google, and Microsoft still be able to minimise their tax?  Have all the loopholes been closed under our law or in conjunction with these OECD  changes?

TREASURER:

I think it is an ever receding finishing line on these sorts of issues and you keep  moving forward. You need to modernise your tax system to deal with the way that

companies are operating in a modern economy. The Prime Minister has talked about  a 21st century economy, well we need a 21st century tax system and a compliance  regime to back that up. Now we put $86 million into the Tax Office to go after these  sorts of things, we put legislation into the Parliament, we were ahead of the curve in  terms of the initiatives that were announced by the OECD and I think we are making  great progress. Now I would like to see a greater level of cooperation on these issues  across the Parliament and looking forward to support for the measures that are  introduced because at the end of the day we just have to do what works Fran. This  shouldn’t be a contentious issue politically; we just need to do what works.

KELLY:

Ok, well we heard in that package there that if this works it should allow countries  like Australia to do things like lower our company tax rate, get more competitive on  that level. That is one of the spin offs for a country like Australia and the government  and others have said for a long time our company tax rates are too high, they are not  competitive. When you were sworn in as Treasurer you said we are in a low wage  growth environment, the thing that is principally undermining the performance of  the economy is largely the tax system. On the radio yesterday the Prime Minister said  everything needs to be on the table when it comes to designing a more productive tax  system. Of all the things on that table, Treasurer, what do you think will do the most  to lift productivity?

TREASURER:

Well what I want to see, as I have said before, is I want a tax system which  encourages Australians to be able to work and to save and invest because that is what  will actually boost growth in our economy…

KELLY:

Yes, so where do you prioritise there?

TREASURER:

The way you will lift revenue, which is already forecast to increase over the budget  and forward estimates, but the way it will particularly lift is if we increase what we  are earning as a country. To do that we need a tax system that gives people incentives  and particularly at the personal income tax level. That is the situation where we have  next year, if you are on an average wage you will go into the second highest tax  bracket. 15 years ago some 80 per cent of Australians were paying 30 cents in the  dollar now today that figure has fallen to 25 per cent.

KELLY:

So you are committed to changing that and giving tax cuts?

TREASURER:

It is inverted - sorry I got those figures round the other way. You had 30 cents in the  dollar was being paid by 80 per cent and now that figure has fallen down to 25 per  cent. So it is very important that we have a tax system that actually rewards effort,  rewards people saving, rewards people investing. That is why it is important that we  look at the tax system in terms of what it produces overall and the trouble with the  tax system debate to date is it has all been locked up in particularly features -  company tax, particular levels of income tax, whether it is the GST or other things  like that. You have got to look at the whole system and how it can actually generate  and produce and support growth.

KELLY:

The government is on the record under the last Treasurer, I think you too committed  to bringing - giving tax cuts - income tax cuts to deal with bracket creep at the next  election. Does that mean, obviously you can’t do that in isolation, at the next election  if not before there will be a tax reform package brought in that offers income tax cuts  and explains how the revenue is going to be raised to pay for those?

TREASURER:

Well, I don’t propose to rush into any of these things. I think what is important is  that we get the tax system right and that needs to take the time it needs to take to get  people along with what is needed to change. I think at the moment I don’t think there  is a broad understanding about the real opportunities for everyday Australians about  what can be achieved for them with changes to the tax system. I think one of the  problems we have in the tax debate is, I have referred to it as a bit of an accountants  picnic but what that means is that people think of tax reform as just ‘well the  government wants you to pay more tax.’ What I am saying is no. What I want is a tax  system that rewards people for doing the things that they want to do in the economy,  businesses to be able to grow and expand and do the things they want to do and that  is what the tax system has to support. The tax system is not there just to suck money  out of people’s pockets, it is supposed to do it in a way that actually grows the  economy not retards the economy. That is why I am very concerned about debates  which sought of suggest that we should be driving up revenue by driving up taxes.

KELLY:

Not asking to rule things in or out at all because everything is on the table, we know  that, including superannuation and the notion of curbing superannuation tax  concessions for the wealthy but there has been a call in the last few days, again, for  focus to also be looking at low income earners and superannuation subsidies for  them. The Government was planning to, had moved to get rid of Labor’s low income  super subsidy. Is that back on the table, help for low income earners?

TREASURER:

One of the interesting things, in the meeting we had last week it was Cassandra  Goldie who raised it - and I worked closely with Cassandra when I was in the last  portfolio on pensions - she said that all of these measures we have to look at whether  they are fit for purpose. Now, what does that mean when it comes to superannuation  and what does it mean for expenditure for that matter? Well, we need, in  superannuation, to have a system that ensures that when people get to retirement  age that they won’t be dependent on a welfare payment, on a pension…

KELLY:

Including lower paid people?

TREASURER:

And obviously that means we need to look at what the savings performance and  capability is of people on lower incomes but they are the right questions, Fran. I  mean the answers will come as we work through the package in more detail but the  message I have for Australians more generally is the only reason we would change  any of this would be to leave people better off and in a stronger position to be able to  be more independent in the economy and to be able to have more choices than they  have now. Now, if the changes don’t achieve that goal then they are not something  that the Government is interested in.

KELLY:

Scott Morrison, can I ask you about penalty rates because the Prime Minister has  given the strongest signal so far that weekend penalty rates should be wound back  that they don’t reflect, the way they are paid don’t reflect the modern economy and  modern lifestyles. Is Government going to make change in this area?

TREASURER:

Again, what I don’t want to do, Fran, is in industrial relations, workplace relations in  this country for far too long it has been this pitched battle between unions and

business, capital and labour, and frankly that is boring and it is not helpful. What we  need to have is a mature discussion about these issues where we look at how the  system works and what we want is more people, particularly young people, being  employed, we need flexibility in the system which means people with disabilities,  people who have been long term unemployed can get a go in the labour market. Now,  I don’t see why you wouldn’t want to consider anything that wouldn’t achieve those  sorts of goals and if we are going to get locked into it and if the Opposition Leader  Bill Shorten wants to go back to yesterday’s politics and drag us into a pro or negative  penalty rate sort of debate I don’t think that helps the economy, I don’t think it helps  the debate. We can have a mature debate about workplace relations, the question is  will broader politics - other parties - be able to engage in the same adult discussion.

KELLY:

Well, the PM’s message was you don’t want people to lose out on this…

TREASURER:

Of course note.

KELLY:

And there seems to be a suggestion of some kind of change in, maybe tax credit in  return for lower rates of pay, you lose on the penalty side but you get a better tax  treatment - ideas like that?

TREASURER:

I think these are all very innovative ideas and in the UK Iain Duncan Smith has done  some excellent work in looking at those sorts of systems. What you want is a tax  system and a payment system that locks together and a labour market system which  links in with that to ensure that you are better off working than being on welfare, that  when you are working you’re not going to be taxed out of existent and that you will be  able to get on and make a way for yourself. Now, we need the flexibility in our system  to ensure we have this agile and innovative economy. Let me refer to a story which I  came across when I was up in Caboolture. There we had a very good welfare  organisation getting people who are drug addicted into work and they worked out  that they couldn’t change the people to get into the job because they had some very  serious disabilities so they changed the workplace to match the person, say for  example who might have been on methadone, and were a bit slow in the morning.  Now, they told me that the only way they could really employ people in that situation  was if they were on casual rates because the award wouldn’t accommodate it. Now, I  want to see people with disabilities, people who are long term unemployed get jobs

and we need a system that helps them get those jobs and I don’t know why anyone  would want to rule out anything that would help young people get into jobs.

KELLY:

So, the Government is not afraid of getting into the IR changes if required?

TREASURER:

The Government is not afraid of getting people into jobs. That is what the  Government is not afraid of and I would like to see other parties, in particular the  Opposition, get past this boring old industrial relations rhetoric of us versus them.  We are all in this together and we need to get young people in jobs.

KELLY:

Can I just ask you finally Treasurer, something in your old portfolio of immigration,  because in a moment we are going to be talking about a case that begins in the High  Court today challenging the Government’s constitutional power to detain people  overseas. Could offshore processing be vulnerable to legal challenge?

TREASURER:

Well, I am not going to commentate on what the High Court may or may not do.  Those matters, I think, are ably being looked after by Minister Dutton. What I will  say is this though, our border protection regime has been incredibly successful, it has  saved lives it has ended the terrible cost that was being incurred and has ensured  integrity of our refugee and humanitarian programme which enabled us recently to  commit to 12,000 additional refugees and humanitarian entrants coming in response  to the Syria crisis. Now, they are all important outcomes and anything that would put  that at risk would greatly concern me and I think it would greatly concern many  Australians.

KELLY:

What about, you have been greatly concerned about the reports over the last months  of abuse and even rape, as we heard last week?

TREASURER:

Of course I have, Fran.

KELLY:

And you are not worried that the offshore detention centre isn’t right in dealing with  those, in allowing that abuse to happen?

TREASURER:

Every day when I was in the portfolio, and every day that Minister Dutton has been  in the portfolio we have sought to improve the arrangements at Nauru. I remember  when we came to Government there was a $1.2 billion funding hole, to even put the  most basic of facilities for families on Nauru. There wasn’t even a playground there,  there weren’t rooms for infants to have their nappies changed; there was nothing  there when we came to Government and we had to spend the money to get all of  those facilities in place - to get the medical facilities in place and we have done a lot  of work. Now, there will always be more work to do and I commend Peter Dutton for  the job that he has done in continuing that programme but at the end of the day,  Fran, we have a border protection regime which ended the deaths and I don’t want to  see that happen again.

KELLY:

Treasurer, thank you very much for joining us.

TREASURER:

Thanks very much, Fran, good to be here with you.
