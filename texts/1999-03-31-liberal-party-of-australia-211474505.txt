HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR KOSOVO

Â

Â

31 March 1999

AA13

Â

The Australian Government will provide immediate 
assistance to relief agencies dealing with the humanitarian crisis in 
Kosovo.

Â

‘Reports from all sources confirm a rapidly deteriorating 
humanitarian situation in the region. Tens of thousands of people are 
heading towards and crossing into the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Albania and Montenegro.

Â

Around 500,000 ethnic Albanians — a quarter of 
Kosovo’s population — have fled their homes, including some 100,000 
in the last few days.

Â

Albanian neighbourhoods have been targeted and destroyed, 
and there are reports of massacres of Kosovar Albanians and of men being 
led away from their families. There are also reports that Serb paramilitary 
units have been pillaging and burning Albanian shops in the provincial 
capital Pristina. I am sure all Australians are as appalled as I am 
by these events.

Â

Extreme conditions confront those fleeing their 
homes in Kosovo, and the flows of refugees to Macedonia and Albania.

Â

Australia will provide $2 million to humanitarian 
organisations working in the region, including the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees ($1 million), CARE Australia ($500,000), the 
Australian Red Cross ($250,000), and World Vision Australia ($250,000).

Â

This assistance will be targeted at meeting the 
immediate relief needs of refugees and internally displaced persons 
fleeing attacks upon them and their communities.

Â

It will be provided through the emergency relief 
budget managed by the Australian Government’s overseas aid agency, 
AusAID.
