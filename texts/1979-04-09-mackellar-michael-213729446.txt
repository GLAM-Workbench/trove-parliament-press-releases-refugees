SECOND REFUGEE BOAT LOCATED

A second refugee boat has been located by a

coastal surveillance aircraft about 100 miles south west of

Darwin.

The vessel the Song Saigon is believed to have about

50 people on board is now being intercepted by the Naval

patrol boat HMAS Assail. It will be escorted to Darwin.

Unevaluated reports of the Song Saigon's movements

had been received in advance of its detection.

Another boat with 112 people on board reached Darwin

earlier today.

Today's arrivals are the first since 6 December 1978.
