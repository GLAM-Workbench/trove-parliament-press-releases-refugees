E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LISA WILKINSON:

Good morning to you, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning.

LISA WILKINSON:

It has been a very full-on week. If I can start with something that Chris Bowen said last night. He's made the  decision to send unaccompanied children to Malaysian detention centres. Do you support this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, what I don't support is a Government which could have fixed this problem a long, long time ago by  picking up the phone to the President of Nauru and all of this rigmarole is due to the fact that Julia Gillard is  too proud to admit that John Howard had it right and to do what John Howard successfully did to stop the  boats.

LISA WILKINSON:

But the problem of unaccompanied children. Does that concern you, specifically, given that this is the  solution that the Government is going for?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the big problem is that yet again, Lisa, the Prime Minister has told fibs. She said that Malaysia would  have no say over who went as part of the 800. Plainly, Malaysia will have a veto. She also said that the  human rights of these people would be respected and yet the two words that Malaysia wants to take out of  the agreement, two minor little words - ‘human rights’. Now, you know, this is an extraordinary thing that  the two words that Malaysia wants to take out of the agreement with Australia are the ‘human rights’ of the  people who are going there.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well, UNHCR has expressed concern over the draft agreement because of the removal of those words,  ‘human rights’.

TONY ABBOTT:

And Lisa, I expect Get-Up! and Julian Burnside and all of the people who were absolutely vitriolic against  the Howard Government, I expect the Greens, all of these people who thought that the Howard Government  was an absolute abomination, to be protesting in the streets against this effort of the Gillard Government.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well, Mr Bowen says that Malaysia has assured him that human rights will be respected. Can we trust  Malaysia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, can we trust the Gillard Government? I think that’s more to the point. I mean, I'm sure the Malaysians  will do that what they think is right by their standards but the question is...

LISA WILKINSON:

Do you think that that will include human rights?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the question is the Gillard Government promised that the human rights of the people who are going to  be sent to Malaysia will be respected and yet that's precisely what the Malaysians don't want to do. So, I  think yet again the Gillard Government has been completely caught out.

LISA WILKINSON:

Ok, well let's move on. Former PM Bob Hawke fronted the cameras yesterday on the carbon tax and made  the point that any reform that is going to make long-term difference really requires bravery. He referenced  his own battle over the Kakadu dispute, which did say that it was going to spell the end of the mining  industry, $35 billion worth of mining industry. Of course, that wasn't the case. Did you take his point from  that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I couldn't really figure why Julia Gillard was living in the past. I mean, that was 20 years ago and she  wastes Question Time rabbiting on about something that happened 20 years ago and that was done by a  Labor government that was a genuinely reforming government in some respect. Look, this carbon tax, it  won't clean up the environment, it will clean out your wallet and it will wipe out jobs big time, simple as  that. Now, I know just how frightened the blue collar workers are of this carbon tax because I've been to  Ford at Geelong, I’ve been to BlueScope at Port Kembla and places that the Prime Minister hasn't been and  won't front, Lisa, because she knows that the blue collar workers of Australia are beginning to revolt against  this toxic tax.

LISA WILKINSON:

But Bob Hawke was and seems to remain a favourite of blue collar workers. And I suppose the point was  with the benefit of hindsight, you can look at the situation of Bob Hawke making that decision, it was very  brave, but Kakadu was protected and the mining industry didn't fall apart.

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s just no parallel between protecting a smart part of the Northern Territory and whacking a toxic tax  on the whole of the Australian economy. There's just no parallel at all, Lisa. Now, the fact of the matter is  that this tax is going to do enormous damage and there are better ways to protect the environment. I keep  saying that we can get emissions down without clobbering jobs and hitting Australians’ cost of living.

LISA WILKINSON:

Nationals Leader Warren Truss confirmed last night that a Coalition Government, if elected, would repeal  any income tax cuts aligned with any carbon tax. Wouldn't that be an unholy mess trying to unravel that  delicate economic balancing act?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Lisa, I say - what tax cuts? I mean this is all…

LISA WILKINSON:

Well, these are the tax cuts for pensioners and low income earners to make sure that the money goes back to  them.

TONY ABBOTT:

These mythical tax cuts. I mean…

LISA WILKINSON:

But we’re not far away from seeing what the final picture is going to look like.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, let’s see it before we speculate about it.

LISA WILKINSON:

So, you don't agree with Warren Truss?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I think that Warren Truss is a terrific colleague and he’s a close friend but the fact of the matter is that  this is a toxic tax and I reckon that Labor's promises about compensation are as believable as the Prime  Minister was six days before the election when she said there would be ‘no carbon tax under the government  I lead’.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright, well Senator David Bushby caused a stir when he miaowed at Senator Penny Wong. He described it  as robust political debate. Most pollies laughed and said that you all do it, that this is the way you all carry  on. Don't voters deserve better from our elected officials?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think sometimes people do go over the top and David Bushby admitted that he had done the wrong  thing and he apologised and I think that’s where the matter should end.

LISA WILKINSON:

But was that a genuine apology? He said that he was sorry that Penny Wong was offended by it. He wasn't  saying that was offensive, I took ownership of it and I am genuinely sorry. He said that, basically, she was  the one with the problem.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, aren’t we making too much of this, Lisa? I mean, he apologised, let's move on. I mean I don’t think  that the Australian public obsess about this kind of thing. I think they want a Government and a Parliament  that does the right thing by them and that's what we really should be talking about.

LISA WILKINSON:

But that’s the point exactly. This is not political robust debate. This is just time-wasting by the pollies who  can't think of a good answer.

TONY ABBOTT:

So, let’s not talk about it. Let’s not talk about it. Let's move on to the things that the people genuinely are  concerned about like the carbon tax, like the mining tax, like the Malaysian refugee swap which is falling to  pieces.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright, ok. Just a final one, we mentioned Bob Hawke fronting the cameras yesterday. He described you as  mad as a cut snake. What do you think of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

He also said he quite liked me, which was nice of him.

LISA WILKINSON:

So you’re quite happy to have a gold stamp on the forehead from Bob Hawke?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, at least he didn’t miaow at me.

LISA WILKINSON:

You just blew your own argument. Tony Abbott, always good to see you here in the studio.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Lisa.
