"A sonior officer has been stood down from his duties, which has prompted  a meeting of officers of the Department convened by the PSU to move a  vote of no-confidence in the Secretary. [Page 6]

'r ... I believe there should be a thorough inquiry into the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. That inquiry should investigate tho  matters of concorn that have bean raised about its operations, and  implementation of the migration program. It should also, however,  examine the Department's capacity to handle in tho future the tasks for  which it is responsible.11 [Page 7]
