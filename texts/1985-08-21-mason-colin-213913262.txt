AID PRIORITIES CRITICIZED

The Australian Democrats spokesperson on foreign affairs# Senator

Colin Mason, today attacked a cynical and inhumane set of

priorities for Australia's foreign aid, which has diverted

fourteen million dollars away from refugee and disaster relief,

mainly in Ethiopia, to increased military aid for Australia's

neighbours, and additional budget subsidies for Papua New Guinea.

"Our contribution towards the international effort to alleviate

the appalling human disaster in Ethiopia has fallen from thirty ,

million to thirteen million dollars," he said. "This represents

a bizarre contrast to the feelings of Australians who contributed

so generously to the world-wide Live Aid telethon so recently.

"While Australia's obligations to the welfare of Papua-New Guinea

are recognized, .it seems inappropriate that while famine relief

has been cut so heavily, we are. increasing our aid to that .

country by six million dollars to $326 million. There are also

increases pf some eight million dollars to military aid to

south-east Asian countries, including the Marcos regime in the

Philippines, which presents an ugly contrast to the cuts in

humanitarian aid. .  .  .

"Apart from this, the total aid budget has been put in real terms

from 0.57% of G.N.P. ten years ago to 0.45% this year. Apart

from a level of 0.44% during the Fraser government, this is the

lowest Australian contribution to world problems in the past two

decades, and comes at a time when the problems of the third world

are worsening and the need for aid from comparatively wealthy

societies is all the greater.
