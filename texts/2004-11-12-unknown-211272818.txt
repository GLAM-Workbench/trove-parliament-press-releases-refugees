DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1068    FRIDAY 12 NOVEMBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT            LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS                SENATE MAJORITY HAS GONE TO THEIR HEADS ALREADY Prime Minister Howard had said the Coalition would not abuse the power of having control of the Senate, but they have already started, the Australian Democrats said today. "For the next three years the major control on the abuse of power is going to be the self control of the Prime Minister. We should all be urging him to show self-control," Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said.  "Australian voters gave the Coalition the keys to the Senate; they did not give them permission to trash the place." The Democrats have challenged the Prime Minister to commit to maintaining current Senate arrangements for scrutinising legislation, holding inquiries and allowing the public and experts to provide submissions into upcoming bills.  "The Government does not have a mandate to minimise existing accountability safeguards such as Budget Estimates hearings or normal scrutiny of legislation in Senate Committees," he said. "The Government is already overstepping its mandate arrogantly acting on issues it did not campaign on including restricting access to abortions and voluntary student unionism.  "They have also stifled the Senate with a shortened 2005 sitting period of only 14 weeks, suggesting they will try and use regulations rather than legislation to avoid parliamentary and public scrutiny." The Prime Minister claimed "the Government will use its majority in the new Senate very carefully, very wisely and not provocatively. We intend to do the things we’ve promised the Australian people we would do but we don’t intend to allow this unexpected but welcome majority in the Senate to go to our heads" (28 October 2004, on the announcement of the Senate result in Queensland). "The Government has no mandate for many of the initiatives it is now talking about.  Before bringing on for debate Private Members bills that would limit women’s access to abortion, they should schedule time for some of the dozens of Private Members Bills that have been before the Parliament in some cases for decades." Senator Bartlett also said the Government should think twice about forcing through legislation that had been previously rejected by the Senate that was not raised during the election campaign including restricting access to disability pensions, and excising thousands of Australian islands from immigration laws. A list of previously rejected legislation and other Coalition plans expected to be pushed through the Parliament after June 2005, follows.
