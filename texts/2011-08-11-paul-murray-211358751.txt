E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PAUL MURRAY:

Good morning Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Paul.

PAUL MURRAY:

What brings you to town today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I’m just on my way out to Solahart Hot Water Systems. This is a significant local business which  is going to be badly impacted by the carbon tax and the paradox is that if a house moves from standard  electric to solar hot water, they make a significant reduction in their emissions. So, you’d think that if you  want to reduce emissions you should be encouraging the use of solar hot water. But the cost of a solar hot  water system is going to go up somewhat under the carbon tax because not only do they use a lot of power in  putting these solar systems together, but steel is one of the major inputs. So, I’m going there to talk to the  business about their concerns and to talk to workers about the impact that a carbon tax might have.

PAUL MURRAY:

So is the carbon tax still the only game in town politically in your mind?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s I think the most important single change which this Government is committed to and it would be a  spectacular economic own goal. I mean, one of the things that obviously you get very conscious of,  particularly when you’re overseas Paul, is just how fragile the international economy is and this is the worst  possible time to be introducing a big new tax. I mean, there’s never a good time to introduce a bad tax but

this is the worst possible time to bring about a change like this and if the Prime Minister had any political  and economic judgement, she’d know that and she wouldn’t go ahead.

PAUL MURRAY:

Well, I went up hill and down dale about that this morning with Wayne Swan and he just says he’s not for  turning on either the carbon tax or the mining tax, even in this environment.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that just goes to show a level of political pig headedness which ought to be an embarrassment in an  Australian Government. I mean look, this is bad policy at the best of times, but it’s particularly bad policy at  the worst of times and while, as I said, the Australian economy continues to perform comparatively well, it  is a very, very fragile and uncertain international environment and on top of the carbon tax and the mining  tax, you’ve also got a Government which is spending lavishly on things like the NBN, but these are not  projects which have been backed up by the sort of cost-benefit analysis which any serious government  would engage in before that kind of spending and which in fact even the current Government promised but  then didn’t deliver.

PAUL MURRAY:

I must say Tony, I think a lot of people enjoyed the respite from the carbon tax war while you were away but  in your absence that very expensive mail-out took place - I certainly got mine a few days ago - explaining  the new clean economy that we are headed for apparently. Do you think that’s changing people’s minds?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I don’t. I think that the more people hear about the carbon tax the less they like it and I think that there is  a truculent mood in the community against the carbon tax and increasingly against the Prime Minister and a  Government that is promoting it.

Now, you know, the interesting thing Paul is that even on the Government’s own figures, the carbon tax will  not significantly reduce Australia’s emissions. I mean, at the moment, our emissions are 578 million tonnes  of carbon dioxide a year. Under the carbon tax, in 2020, our emissions will be 621 million tonnes. So, we  are going to go through all the pain and the effort of this new tax and our emissions are still going to go up.

Now, this is on the Government’s own figures. Now, at $29 a tonne, which is what the carbon tax will be in  2020, our emissions increase.  In 2050 with a carbon tax of would you believe at $131 a tonne - and this is  on the Government’s own figures - our emissions are still going to be 545 million tonnes.

So, this idea that a carbon tax is going to dramatically reduce our emissions is just dead wrong. So what’s  the point, Paul? I mean, what’s the point of all of this? In the end, it just looks like the triumph of ideology  over common sense.

PAUL MURRAY:

From my discussions with people most people seem to have moved on from the carbon tax debate. They’ve  made their mind up one way or the other and certainly I think in Western Australia they’re on the other side,  I think there’s more opposition than support here in Western Australia. Do you think that you need to  refocus on some of the other political issues around Australia? I mean, a lot of people will be disheartened  that you’ve come back and on day one you’re continuing your negative programme on carbon tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

The best thing that government can do is avoid making difficult situations worse, Paul. I mean, the most  positive thing I can do for Australia right now is to stop the carbon tax and I say no to the carbon tax  because I say yes to companies like Rheem and Solahart and I say yes to affordable energy, I say yes to  economic growth. These are all the things which the carbon tax is threatening. Now, you know, if people  want me to stop talking about the carbon tax the Government should drop the carbon tax. I will gladly no  longer talk about the carbon tax if the Government drops it, but as long as the Government is persisting with  this carbon tax I owe it to the Australian people, I owe it to all of the people who are going to be hurt by this  carbon tax to keep talking about it until such time as the Government does drop it and the fact that the  Government is now desperate to talk about any subject except the carbon tax shows how toxic they know it  has become.

PAUL MURRAY:

They probably don’t want to talk about asylum seekers at the moment, given what’s happening in the High  Court.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, well that’s another example of the fact that this Government is monumentally incompetent. I mean,  they couldn’t organise a booze up at a brewery, this mob, that’s how hopeless they are and there is an option  which almost certainly wouldn’t attract the ire of the High Court and that’s Nauru. We know it worked in  the past, we know it doesn’t have the human rights problems of Malaysia and but for the Prime Minister’s  pig headedness and stubbornness and the Government refusal to acknowledge that John Howard got some  things, many things in fact, right, the Government should pick up the phone…

PAUL MURRAY:

Well, it looks like they’re dusting off Papua New Guinea and PNG’s new Prime Minister is in favour of that  and of course, that was one of John Howard’s government’s options.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right and the fact that they’re going down this path, or trying to go down this path, is a tacit  admission that John Howard had it right and the Coalition has it right. I’ll believe it when I see it though,  Paul because we’ve got a long history from this Government of announcements being made but not  delivered upon, of journalists being carefully briefed that’s something’s about to happen and then months  later nothing’s actually happened. So let’s wait and see what actually turns up in PNG.

PAUL MURRAY:

Thanks for talking to us today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much Paul.
