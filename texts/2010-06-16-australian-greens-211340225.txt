Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens Spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights:

"The level of debate on asylum-seekers reminds us that neither Labor nor Liberal have a practical, long-term and humane solution.

"The problem is that both old parties see this issue just as numbers of people on boats and how they can

stop them - they lack an understanding of what these people face, and our obligations to deal with their

claims quickly and appropriately.

"Polling released yesterday shows a majority of Australians believe asylum-seekers should be allowed to

stay in this country if they are found to be genuine refugees. We already know that more than 90 per cent

of boat arrivals are found to be genuine. So why are our political leaders so fixated on a push to "stop the

boats"?

"We must do everything we can to put in place an orderly system for processing people's claims for

asylum, but we have to acknowledge that fleeing persecution is not an orderly process by its very nature.

This means we need a system that gives the world's most vulnerable people a fair go.

"It's simple - no child should be held in detention and under this Government they continue to be.

"But Tony Abbott's policy to bring back TPVs will put the lives of women and children at further risk as

happened under Howard.

"We can't afford any more policies designed purely to project a "tough" image - we must remove the

suspension on processing claims, and use metropolitan centres not half-full regional schools and colleges

so we can start clearing the backlog quickly, fairly and humanely.''
