DAVID OLDFIELD:

Tony, thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

David, thanks for having me.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Much appreciated indeed. Look, the situation here, Tony, of what’s talking place with what seems to be now  the Gillard Pacific Solution. Whilst we all welcome this, it’s extraordinary, isn’t it, after all of this time with  the mistakes of Rudd, then perpetuated by the Gillard Government with the ostrich, the head in the sand  Chris Bowen, the Minister for Immigration, who has no idea what’s going on or doesn’t even seem to care,  to suddenly now go back to what was working?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they’ve just picked one element, David, of what works. They’ve gone to Manus, which was a  relatively small centre, had a capacity of about 500 people but they’re still terrified to pick up the phone to  the President of Nauru. That centre could take about 1,500 people so obviously that would be a much more  significant signal to the people smugglers that the game is up. Now, the point I make is that just reopening  Manus, if the Government is able to do that - no thanks to Julia Gillard but apparently plenty of thanks to  Kevin Rudd - if they Government can reopen Manus, that’s a small step in the right direction but it’s not  enough, you need Nauru, you need temporary protection visas, you need the readiness to turn boats around  where that can be done safely, and you also need a strong willingness to take back control of the detention  centres from people who are breaking Australian law, if they are breaking the law, and plainly we’ve had a  number of incidents in detention centres recently - the riots at Villawood, the capture of the detention centre  at Christmas Island by detainees - we’ve had a number of very serious incidents and the Government just  has to make it very clear that people involved in this kind of behaviour will never get permanent residency  in our country.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Well, strong or otherwise, we’ve certainly had a lack of willingness of any kind to apparently look after the  interests of the citizens of this nation, first and foremost, given all the circumstances we’ve seen with these  asylum seekers. Firstly Tony, why are they so hell bent on not doing something with Nauru which seems to  be able to be opened fairly readily and, secondly, if they do put all these people offshore, will it also achieve  stopping them accessing all of the appeal processes that you and I and taxpayers pay for?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, there is no doubt that offshore centres, particularly third country centres, do stop a lot of the  legal appealing which has gone on otherwise, so I think there is no doubt, as the Howard Government  recognised, that third country processing is much more effective in that respect but the basic problem,  David, is that they are terrified of finally admitting that John Howard got it pretty well completely right and  they’ve got it pretty well completely wrong. The other thing is, they’ve got this alliance with the Greens.  Now, I hope Bob Brown is as ferociously and self-righteously critical of the Gillard Government today as he  was of the Howard Government and I hope Julia Gillard is happy quoted back at her the words of  condemnation that she so frequently uttered against the Howard Government, which according to her was in  breach of all that was good and decent and true with its Pacific Solution and yet I’m sure what was regarded  as an absolute human rights outrage back then will be justified lamely today as necessary to stop the boats.  But the point I make is that on its own none of this will stop the boats or end the protests in the detention  centres. They’ve got to embrace the whole package. They’ve got to accept that they were completely wrong  and that Howard was pretty well completely right.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Tony, look, thank you very much for you time and congratulations on the way you’ve just stayed on this, in  the most positive sense, like a dog with a bone, a positive dog with a bone, stayed on it because it is  important to so many of us and there’s been so little done where this Government is concerned, just turning  their back on the violence and all of these people that we don’t want in the country. Thank you for being  with us today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, David.
