Border Protection Command intercepts vessel

HMAS Maryborough, operating under the control of Border Protection Command,  intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel north west of Browse Island this morning.

Initial indications suggest there are 84 passengers and 3 crew on board.

The boat was initially detected by a Customs and Border Protection Dash 8 aircraft, operating  under the control of Border Protection Command.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity  and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationality is yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Afghans, the  processing suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will apply.
