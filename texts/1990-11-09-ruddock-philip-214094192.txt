DELAYS IN ASSESSING GORS APPLICATIONS  '  DEPLORABLE

9  N o v e m b e r  1 9 9 0

"The Government 1s decision to transfer old Grant o f Resident Status  applications to the Sydney Department of Immigration for quicker  processing has been an abject failure" Philip Ruddock,  Shadow  Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs,  commented today.

Although the section set up in the Sydney office to clear the  backlog of old applications has been in existence for some six months  there are still over 4,000 cases awaiting assessment. "I understand  at the present time spouse and compassionate cases are being looked

at, but other categories - such as aged parents - are still waiting  to be considered.

I have one particular case in my own electorate where an aged parent,  with the balance of family here in Australia,  lodged an application  in March 1989 and has not yet been called for interview. This 70 year-  old woman may still have to wait another 12-18 months before her

application is reached and processing can begin.

This seems to me to be another example of the breakdown in immigration  administration.  Absence of resources is leading to poor decisionÂ­ making ,  as seen with sham marriages and manipulation of refugee  protection. Â·

If the Minister had determined,  in relation to the Chinese students  in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre,that their  circumstances would be examined case-by-case, some of the ?50m  allocated in the Budget for Social Security, Medicare,  Education and  Training for Chinese students granted four year temporary entry,  would have been available to clear the backlog o f GORS cases in their

office of lodgement."
