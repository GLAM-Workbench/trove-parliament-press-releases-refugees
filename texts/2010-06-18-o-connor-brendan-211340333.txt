Border Protection Command intercepts vessels  Friday, 18 June 2010

Border Protection Command today intercepted two suspected irregular entry vessels.

HMAS Armidale, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, intercepted a  vessel west of Lacepede Islands.

The vessel was initially identified by a Dash 8 surveillance aircraft, under the control of  Border Protection Command.

Initial indications suggest 26 passengers are on board.

HMAS Wollongong, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, intercepted  a vessel north-west of Christmas Island.

Initial indications suggest 48 passengers are on board.

Both groups will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity  and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationalities are yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Sri Lankans or  Afghans, the processing suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will  apply.
