New Immigration minister must not to sacrifice  the mental health of asylum seekers



Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today spoke at the 'Forgotten Rights' conference  that detailed the psychological trauma caused by current immigration policies,  and used the opportunity to challenge Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone to  take a more humanitarian approach.

"Amanda Vanstone, is presiding over an immigration policy that systematically  abuses detainees psychologically. She must end this cruel regime, she must start  today," Senator Nettle said.

"We have children with depression, mothers attempting suicide, already  traumatised detainees further brutalised and all in the name of political  expediency.

"The Minister has recognised the trauma of this policy generates, granting an  humanitarian visa in the Sammaki case. Other suffering families deserve our  compassion too.

"The conference today has detailed new information on the prevalence of suicide  attempts and widespread depression and mental anguish. These are the flesh  and blood consequences of John Howard's political posturing and they shame us  all.

"The cause of this trauma is the mandatory detention policy.

"The Greens continue to call the abolition of the mandatory detention of asylum  seekers, because we simply cannot support a policy which amounts to torture for  so many children, men and women - who came here look for our help.

"The Greens call for the scrapping of Temporary Protection Visas, which simply  continue the limbo for these people, and the introduction of a community based  asylum seeker processing and resettlement programme.
