MIGRANT EDUCATION Â·  Â·

carry out a study of the educational facilities available to

migrants, and ways of ensuring that they are updated to

meet changing needs. All Ministers indicated their support

for this study.

Mr. Landa said, "the Ministers are expecting rapid growth

in Australia's refugee settlement programmes and that the

needs of new arrivals must be taken into close account in

education planning". .

Uhile many services are provided through schools, TAFE

colleges and the Adult Migrant Education Service, many problems

exist, such as the need to offer suitable educational courses

in a wider number of locations. . . Â·

To overcome the difficulties experienced by these new settlers

there is an urgent need for TAFE and other tertiary education

institutions to develop, or extend as appropriate, curricula

to assist these new settlers in maintaining their skills.
