Labor Achievements- Liberal Scandals: Parliament’s First Session

The opening session of the 40th Parliament has revealed a stark divide between a Howard Government paralysed by scandal and internal divisions, and a Labor Party leading the agenda on Parliamentary reform, ministerial conduct, asylum seekers, employee entitlements and tax reform for small business.

In the first four weeks of Parliament, Labor introduced proposals to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Improve Parliamentary standards, through an independent Speaker, question time limits and a requirement for ministers to answer questions;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Lift the BAS red tape nightmare from small business;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establish a scheme to guarantee payment of wages and other accrued entitlements in the case of employer insolvency without placing a burden on small business;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Allow sub-contractors to recover wages from a principal contractor if another sub-contractor higher up the chain collapses;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introduce a 12-month cooling off period for former ministers to prevent a repeat of the Wooldridge House and Reith/Tenix affairs; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Successfully amend the asylum seekers legislation.

Throughout this same period the Howard Government has lurched from crisis to crisis.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The exposure of the “Children overboard” lie and the Prime Minister’s continuing refusal to admit who in his office received the 13 photos that exposed the lie;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Former ministers Reith and Wooldridge taking up lucrative private sector consultancies in their former portfolio areas within days of leaving office;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Dr Wooldridge’s decision to divert $5 million in funding for rural and regional health and asthma programs to the proposed headquarters of his new employer;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The DSD spy scandal;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Treasurer Peter Costello’s $5 billion in foreign exchange losses;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prime Minister’s failure to act to protect the office of the Governor-General from ongoing embarrassment caused by Dr Hollingworth’s management of child sex abuse allegations while Archbishop of Brisbane; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mr Howard’s endorsement and extension of Senator Bill Heffernan’s malicious and false attack on Justice Michael Kirby and on the integrity of the NSW Police Force, the Wood Royal Commission, the Department of Finance and the High Court.

While Mr Howard insists that he knew nothing about all these scandals, internal divisions have split his government over the Speaker, anti-terrorism laws, and now, media ownership laws.

His Parliamentary timetable has been a disaster, with important legislation having to be dropped, or rushed into the parliament with little or no consultation.

It’s no wonder leadership rumblings have begun within the Liberal Party, as close Costello allies such as Michael Yabsley openly question Mr Howard’s judgment. But will Peter Costello show the courage he has never displayed before?

The record from the first session of the 40th Parliament is clear: constructive Labor policies and a Howard Government in crisis.
