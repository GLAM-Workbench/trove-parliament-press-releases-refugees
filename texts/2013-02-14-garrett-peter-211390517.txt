$240 million extra for disadvantaged schools and quality teaching

Thursday 14 February 2013

Students and teachers in 1700 schools will benefit from an extra $240 million in  Gillard Government funding, aimed at boosting teaching standards, improving  literacy and numeracy results and providing extra resources for disadvantaged  schools.

Minister for School Education Peter Garrett today released the 2012 progress  reports for the $2.5 billion Smarter Schools National Partnerships and announced  the next instalments of funding to be paid to states and territories.

“These three partnerships - Improving Teacher Quality, Low SES Schools and  Literacy and Numeracy - have given teachers more access to professional  development and training, and provide extra funding for schools to hire specialist  staff and other resources,” he said.

“And they are leading to better results for students. For example, In Year 5  Numeracy, 80 per cent of schools funded under the NP improved their results.

“The reports released today show that school systems are achieving strong results.  Hundreds of schools are reporting increased attendance rates, improvement in  NAPLAN scores, and more qualifications for their principals and teachers.

“Our funding is helping schools establish homework centres so students have a  dedicated place to study. They are helping Indigenous people enter the teaching  profession, and paying for schools to employ literacy and numeracy coaches or  develop personalised learning plans for students at risk of falling behind.

“These are the things we know work to improve results. That’s why under our  National Plan for School Improvement every school in the country will be introducing  similar strategies, ensuring every student gets the support they need to reach their  potential.

“Under our plan, extra funding for schools to pay for more staff and better resources  will be permanently locked in, so schools can plan for the future.”

Mr Garrett said the Coalition had refused to commit to the future of the National  Partnerships, meaning schools across Australia could lose up to $3.3 billion in future  funding unless a new funding system is introduced.

“The last thing we need is for funding to be stripped from these schools, reversing all  the good work being carried out under Smarter Schools and leaving too many  students at risk of falling behind,” he said.

The latest round of funding under the Smarter Schools National Partnerships  includes:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $227.1 million to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds under the  Low SES School Communities National Partnership  Ã¯ÂÂ· $13.4 million to help states and territories improve school leadership under  the Improving Teacher Quality National Partnership - Principal Professional

Development component.
