LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

12 December 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   PRESS CONFERENCE,  PARLIAMENT HOUSE



Subjects: Cabinet reshuffle; same-sex marriage; border protection.

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

The reshuffle does nothing to strengthen our economy, to stop the boats or to reduce the cost of living  pressures on Australia’s forgotten families. The Prime Minister had to buy the loyalty of the faceless men  but she couldn’t afford to sack anyone. So, now the worst government in Australia’s history has the biggest  cabinet in Australia’s history. You’ve got Evans and McClelland who have lost their jobs but stay in the  Cabinet; you’ve got Carr who has lost his job but stays in the ministry. It really is a sign of a Prime Minister  who has no authority, no authority over her own government. It’s not a reshuffle about meeting the  challenges of our country - it’s a reshuffle about meeting the challenge of Kevin Rudd. That’s essentially  what we’ve seen today.

QUESTION:

Do you still rule out that you won’t change your shadow ministry and will this be the one that you take to  the next election?

TONY ABBOTT:

What the Government has is a policy problem. Yes, there is a personnel problem, too, but it is essentially a  policy problem. We don’t have a policy problem; we don’t have a personnel problem. While you never  know what the future holds because you never know who might one day decide to retire, the fact is I’ve got  a very, very good team and it’s the team I expect to take to the election.

QUESTION:

Can you rule it out, though, without any retirements or anything like that, will you be - is this the team you  will be taking to the next election? Yesterday you were quite strong on it. Are you backing away from that at  all?

TONY ABBOTT:

2



No I’m not at all. I’m saying it’s a very strong team. It’s a very strong team and it’s the team I expect to take  to the election.

QUESTION:

Are you saying you have no under performers and no one worthy of promotion?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I often think to myself after I watch the tape of a press conference, “Gee, I could have done better.”  So, I think all of us think from time to time that our performance could be stronger but I think I have got the  best possible Coalition team and it’s the team I expect to take to the election.

QUESTION:

Can you pledge today that, assuming that she doesn’t retire, that Bronwyn Bishop will be a minister in an  Abbott Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not going to go through individuals because we could play silly games here but since you’ve  raised her, the answer is yes. I’m not going to further comment about individuals except to say - and I really  do say this with deep conviction - it’s a good team, a very good team indeed and it’s the team I expect to  take to the election.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, just on a slightly different topic. In the last couple of weeks have you mentioned to any of your  frontbenchers that you were prepared to give a conscience vote on gay marriage?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve had a lot of discussion with a lot of people over the last week or so and a lot of issues have been  canvassed but the Shadow Cabinet met this morning, we had a very good discussion of lots of issues  including the question of gay marriage and we resolved to affirm the existing position. This was the position  that we took to the election. It was the position we took to the 2007 election, it was the position we took to  the 2004 election. As I said over the weekend, a quick check of the transcripts shows that on at least five  separate occasions during the election campaign I affirmed that the Coalition’s position, our policy position,  was that marriage was between a man and a woman. On no fewer than eight separate occasions the Prime  Minister affirmed that the Labor Party’s strong position was that marriage was between a man and a woman  and that the Labor Party would not be changing its position in the ensuing term of parliament. I believe that  we should keep our commitments.

QUESTION:

Isn’t it a funny definition of being a party of conscience if you implicitly tie them to a party policy when  some of those people who are part of your team might have actually been quiet on the subject during the last  election?

TONY ABBOTT:

But the point is that the ultimate obligation of politicians is to maintain their commitments to the electorate.  I mean, the greatest question of political integrity is to honour your promises to the electorate. Now, all of us  promised before the election that this was a question of Coalition policy and it would be a pretty weak, I

think pretty conscienceless opposition if we were to say one thing before the election and say a different  thing after the election. I’ll leave that kind of trickiness to the Government. That’s not our business.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, there are some shadow ministers, though, that don’t share your personal stance. Did you tell  them to pull their heads in when it comes to commenting publicly on their views on gay marriage?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, all of my colleagues are political professionals, they all know the rules and we have a position. We  affirmed it today.

QUESTION:

What about the discussions you had today? I don’t doubt your summation of the Coalition party room being  against gay marriage in a majority sense but what were the discussions inside Shadow Cabinet? What were  the twos and fours on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you won’t be surprised if I don’t go into the details of who said what. Look, we had a good discussion.  It was a lengthy discussion. It canvassed things - as you would expect - and we affirmed the position. We  affirmed the position because we are not in the business as a Coalition of saying one thing before an  election, committing one way before an election and then doing the opposite after an election. That kind of  conscienceless behaviour, that kind of conscienceless political behaviour I will leave to the Labor Party.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, I accept that your position on gay marriage, or the party’s position on gay marriage will remain  the same but can you recognise or do you think there’s a shift within your party and a shift within the  community to see this change? Can you see that changing for you anywhere down the track?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve had a very strong position on this. Our party has had a very strong position on this. I think there  are good public interest reasons for marriage being between a man and a woman, as I tried to explain briefly  on the weekend. Marriage from time immemorial in our culture has not just been about two people  committing to each other, it’s also been about families and I think it’s very important that we respect the  importance of families. I think it’s very important that we respect the rights of children to at least start life  with a mother and a father. I think that’s very important and I think it’s quite sensible for the Coalition to  have this policy. Let’s face it - as recently as 14 months ago, it was the unambiguous, clear position of the  Labor Party, too. I mean, the Prime Minister said again and again and again before the last election and  subsequently that this was her definite position and it was the definite position of the Labor Party.

Now, I accept that there is a fickleness and an inconstancy about this government. I accept that this is a  government which is trying to meet the challenge for the soul of the Left by out-greening Bob Brown on  some issues, but we are not in the business of that. We will stick to our commitments and that was the very  strong view of the Shadow Cabinet today.

QUESTION:

Can I ask on asylum seekers, Mr Abbott? A few months ago Andrew Metcalfe, the head of the department,  warned that if we resorted to onshore processing then we would get, you know, 600 or so a month. He has

been proven right on that - actually, we are getting more than that. He also said your policy solution alone  wouldn’t work, that you needed Malaysia. Are you prepared to have a re-look at that legislation in the new  year and allow the Government to pass Malaysia if this number of boat people still continues?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you are certainly right, Phil, that the rate of arrival of boat people has doubled since the Government  effectively announced its policy of onshore release. I mean, it’s not onshore processing, it’s onshore release.  Now, you can’t have a government which on the one hand claims that it supports offshore processing but in  fact practices onshore release and has actually removed, as part of the crisis mini-budget last week, the  funding for an offshore processing policy. So, I just think this is a totally shambolic government when it  comes to border protection. Effectively, this is a government which has given up on border protection and if  the Prime Minister was serious about border protection, she’d bring the parliament back this week and she  would get through the parliament the best offshore processing policy that the parliament will pass and that’s  the policy that’s worked in the past.

Now, I accept that there have been certain statements by certain people about what worked in the past might  not work in the future - give it a go. Give it a go. When sensible people have got the same problem today  that they had yesterday, they put in place today the same solutions that worked yesterday.

Thanks very much.
