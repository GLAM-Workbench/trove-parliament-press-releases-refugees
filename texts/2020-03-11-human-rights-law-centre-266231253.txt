Andrews Government must fix laws to tackle rising hate in  Victoria

The Andrews Government must take a stand against rising hate in the Victorian community, say  a coalition of Union, civil society, faith-based and human rights groups who will give evidence on  Wednesday to a Parliamentary Inquiry considering proposed changes to Victoria’s anti-vilification  laws.

The Inquiry was called in response to Fiona Patten’s private member’s Bill proposing  amendments to Victoria’s anti-vilification laws. The coalition will argue that Fiona Patten’s Bill  does not go far enough and will advocate for strong anti-vilification laws that can stop hate in its  tracks. The coalition of organisations will explain that new laws must:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ban the Nazi swastika and public display of vilifying and offensive material.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Broaden the categories of people protected under the law from race and religious belief to

also include LGBTIQ people, people with a disability and women.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Enact stronger civil and criminal laws so that the courts and police can properly hold people

to account for hateful conduct.

Ruth Barson, Joint Executive Director, the Human Rights Law Centre:

“Right now, our politicians and police are hamstrung in the face of rising hate in Victoria. Last  year, Premier Andrews didn’t have the power to stop a Neo-Nazi concert. This year, Victoria  Police didn’t have the power to remove a Nazi Swastika flag flying above a house in regional  Victoria. The Andrews Government must stand up against intolerance and introduce strong laws  so that we can all be safe and live a life free from hate.”

Luke Hilakari, Secretary, Victorian Trades Hall Council:

“With a rise in hate from the far right we need people to have more rights to stop discrimination  and vilification.

“The union movement will continue to bring our collective strength to stand with those who are  being targeted with everything from hate speech to violence.

“Government has a role here to continue to show its leadership by amending the anti-vilification  laws, to make it easier for people to bring discrimination cases. Victoria needs tougher laws that  stop hate in its tracks.”

Abiola Ajetomobi, Director, Asylum Seeker Resources Centre (ASRC):

“We are lucky to have thousands of refugees calling Australia home. People rebuilding their lives,  contributing to society and stepping up as leaders in their communities.

“It’s important that our laws are inclusive and protect the rights of all Victorians no matter where  we come from. Laws that clearly outline the responsibilities of all of us and that hold those who  choose to divide us to account. Laws that put an end to increasingly discriminatory discourse.

“The Victorian Government must act swiftly to change the laws so every Victorian can live safely  and equally in our community.”

Renaire Druery, Human Rights Director, GetUp:

“Far right hate and extremism is on the rise on our streets, on social media and in public life, and  it’s going unchecked.

“Last year, we saw thousands of people demand the Victorian Government shut down a neo-Nazi concert. People everywhere want stronger and bolder action to tackle the rise of hate.

“People expect decisive action that bans vilfying material like the Nazi Swastika, and laws that  not only protect us, but promote a diverse and safe community.

“Right now, Victoria has the chance to put forward historic legislation that stops hate in its tracks  and paves the way for the rest of the country.”

Dr Dvir Abramovich, Chairman, Anti-Defamation Commission:

"This is the moment of truth for the Victorian government, and the Anti-Defamation Commission,  which launched the campaign to criminalise the public display of the Nazi swastika more than  two years ago, is calling on our elected representatives not to pass the ball, not to give a free  pass to homegrown racists who are nourished by inaction, but to take the moral high ground. As  we witness an unprecedented surge in antisemitism and hatred in our nation, casting a shadow  over our lives, now is the time to act.

“There is no perfect cure to the disease of intolerance, but a good step is to send the  unmistakable message that Nazism has no place in Australia. This inquiry is a timely opportunity  for the state government to once and for all close the lid on this troubling phenomenon and ban  the public showcasing of this emblem of evil and genocide. We can disagree on many issues, but  we all have to be unified in fighting the growing threat of bigotry and extremism and ensure that  the phrase 'Never Again' is now.”

Anna Brown, CEO of Equality of Australia:

“No one should be a target of hateful speech or conduct because of who they are or who they  love. We should all be able to walk down the street without being abused or harassed. Hate  conduct and hate speech can have devastating impacts on LGBTIQ people and other  marginalised communities. We stand with people of all faiths and backgrounds to call for stronger  laws against hate speech and hate conduct.

“Currently Victoria has laws that only protect some people against hate speech but not others.  We need stronger laws in Victoria that protect everyone from hate, equally.”
