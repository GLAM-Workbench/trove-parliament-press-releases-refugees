PRESS STATEMENT BY PHILIP RUDDOCK SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

"Australia's Migration Program"

Opposition Spokesman for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  '"Philip Ruddock today criticised the Minister, Mr Hurford  for using an overseas forum in which to make a significant  announcement about the likely composition of Australia's

migration program. .

"It would have been more appropriate and more in the spirit  of bipartisanship if the Minister had indicated his intentions  in Australia first.

Mr Ruddock said he would welcome any increase in the size  of the migration program but said he was disappointed that  the Minister had continued to link the size of the migration  program to the level of unemployment.

"I have yet to see any compelling evidence which draws a  direct link between the two", he said.

"It is also interesting that Mr Hurford does not believe  that Australia's economy can sustain any significant increase  in our migration program.

"These comments are at variance with those of the Prime  Minister and the Treasurer when one recalls that Mr Hawke  has told us that under the Labor Government we have had  *The greatest economic recovery ever in Australia's history'

and Mr: Keating has described the economy as 'magnificent'.

Mr Ruddock said that he welcomed Mr Hurford's commitment to  increase migration from traditional sources but said that  he was concerned at the changes forshadowed to our refugee  intake which would see a reduction in the number of IndoÂ­ Chinese Refugees.

"Australia still has a continuing moral obligation to assist  those in our own region, not only for humanitarian reasons  but through a concern for future security, not only for  Australia but for the countries in the South East Asian

region.
