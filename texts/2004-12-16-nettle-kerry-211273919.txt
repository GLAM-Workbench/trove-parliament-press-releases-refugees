Hunger strikers bake on tin roof while  Minister ignores their pleas

16th December  2004

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on Immigration Minister  Amanda Vanstone to agree to review the asylum claims of the Iranian  detainees including the 25 currently on hunger strike in Baxter  Detention Centre.

"Amanda Vanstone must act now to save these men and all their  compatriots from the deadly situation that their long and harsh  incarceration has left them in," Senator Nettle said.

"This situation is now life or death. The Minister must act now to  ensure there is no tragic death as a result of her intransigence.

"The three desperate men on a tin roof at Baxter are in particular  danger. Temperatures are soaring into the high 30s and set to reach  over40 degrees by the weekend, and these men are getting weaker by  the day.

"The fact is that these asylum seekers have been driven into  dangerous desperation by their long harsh detention and the threat of  the deportation to face persecution in Iran.

"These men need urgent independent psychiatric assessments and  must have their cases reviewed by the department in light of the  deteriorating political situation in Iran, their own deteriorating mental  condition.

"When innocent men are willing to die in these detention camps in an  effort to get justice then it should be obvious to all that the mandatory  detention regime is cruel and inhume policy which must be abolished."

The Greens will be joining protests and vigils around the country on  Friday and Saturday in solidarity with the hunger strikers calling for  the release of asylum seekers from the government's prisons.
