AUDITOR-GENERAL SLAMS DUTTON ON HUMANITARIAN SETTLEMENT

PROGRAM

Another report by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) highlights the

failures that are consuming Peter Dutton’s Department of Home Affairs - this

time slamming his management of the Humanitarian Settlement

Program (HSP).



Peter Dutton’s Department took over the $130 million program from the

Department of Social Services in July - with more than $19 million being spent

trying to fix the broken IT system that oversees the delivery of services to some

16,000 clients each year.



While Peter Dutton is nowhere to be seen, the Auditor-General warned that the

management and delivery of these important services had only been “partially

effective".



Furthermore, only some of the intended benefits of moving the scheme to the

Department of Home Affairs have been realised whilst the program

performance management was of even more concern.



“HSP program performance has not been appropriately managed or reported,

and the department was not able to determine if the objective of the HSP is

being met. Client outcome data is not being tracked and Key Performance

Indicators (KPIs) in the contracts have not been effectively

implemented.” - Auditor-General’s report



Peter Dutton’s incompetence and mismanagement means newly-arrived refugees are missing out on the opportunities and vital services which

are meant to ensure they can become active members of the Australian

community.



This latest audit adds to Peter Dutton’s dismal performance in managing his

Department of Home Affairs.



How many more reports are required before something is done to help

the hapless and incompetent Minister do his day job?



Peter Dutton is a Minister that will head into his Christmas holidays with his feet



up while his Department struggles to keep its IT systems operating - whether

it be for the HSP or at our borders.



As crises unfold inside his Home Affairs Department, Peter Dutton

is still persisting with the privatisation Australia’s visa system, which is set to

cut 2,000 Australian jobs and undermine the integrity of our country’s sovereign

visa system.



As with many previous ANAO audits critical of Home Affairs, Labor would like to

see the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit examine the issue

further in 2020.
