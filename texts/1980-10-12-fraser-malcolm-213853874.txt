ELECTORATE TALK

ELECTORATE TALK ' ON 3HA BY THE PRIMS MINISTER, THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MALCOLM  FRASER. .

H ello Ladies and Gentlemen. In the electio n  next Saturday we must  vote in  A u stra lia 's In terests for the Party which v;e b elieve can  ......le a d ; 14s responsibly, through a decade of opportunity and of increasing b e n e fit fo r a l l  A ustralians.

During the la s t  fiv e  years Doug Anthony and 1 in partnership with  a l l  people' in  th is  country, have made Australia a strong country and  one th a t's  respected. Our recovery has taken place in a d if f ic u lt   economic world and today our strength is  admired by many other

in d u str ia lise d  cou n tries>  but the strength of th is economy mustn't  be s a c r ific e d . I t  i s  only through a strong and stable economy that  fa m ilie s can plan for the future. People can get the jobs that they  want, confident th at what they've gained w ill not be taken from them

because of incompetence In Government management. ' \

We lowered in fla tio n  g re a tly , and that means that Australian costs  are down. We're s e llin g  more manufactured goods, more rural and  mineral products in overseas markets. Investors here and overseas  recogn ise our hew strength with the resu lt that investment i s  r isin g .  There1 s  expansion in bur fa c to r ie s, new equipment i s  beihg in sta lle d  ,Â·' Towns>  ports and railways are being b u i l t . Businessmen are.now taking

r isk s in  the knowledge that Australia knows where i t ' s  goingSand the  most p lea sin g  r e s u lt of a ll th is i s  that employment i s  growing and  jobs are being created. So th is is n 't  development for development's  sake, i t  i s  development because of. what i t  means for Australian

fa m ilie s  because o f what i t  means to  Australian vforking men and women

In the la s t  twelve months the growth in overall employment in  r " T r e h T ^ r i B ^ T h e T g t b ^ t h : ^ i n : : , t e e n a g e ; ^ m p l o y m e :

was the b est for f if t e e n  years. The growth in rural employment was  the b est fo r th ir ty  years. Now these are real achievements. We. must  keep them in  mind when we go to vote on Saturday. Because  achievements that have been hard won can so e a sily  be sa crificed

and by any responsible analysis the Labor prescription for the  e ig h tie s  would plunge A ustralia back into the great d if f ic u lt ie s   from which we have recovered. D iffic u ltie s  which many overseas  cou n tries are now encountering. D iffic u ltie s  which sen sib le p o lic ie s   and sound economic management can avoid for A u stralia.

spending programmes so that a conservative estimate of the cost  of a Laboi' Government would he enormous.

Many times leading up to th is e le c tio n , Labor have said that their  programmes would .be implemented. Only on Friday Mr. Young said  that none o f the programmes enunciated by Mr. Hayden 'would go out  the window. A ustralia ju st cannot afford Labor's extravagance, \ %  Labor's spending. You can’t afford i t  and make no mistake, you'd

be paying for i t ,  '

The r e s u lt o f Labor's spending and o f theii: other p o lic ie s would be  ' in f la t io n  o f about 20%  and what doss that do to a grocery b i l l  in

the supermarket. The $45.00 b i l l  very soon becomes a $54.00 b i l l   and then you'd find that a $3.00 a week tax cut would look pretty  th in . T hat's the sort of thing Labor did la s t time they were in

o f f i c e , Whatever your savings are now, whatever your economic  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ security" i s  nov7, these would be sabotaged by in fla tio n  brought about  by g rea tly  Increased spending.

And what’s even worse than th at, because what they didn't s te a l from  you in  in fla tio n , they would then take in higher taxation, because  over and over again the Labor Party have promised you higher taxation. ' In fa c t Mr. W illis , who's the Shadow Treasurer, has spoken about

what he c a lls  the mamouth task in rebuilding the public sector, i . e .   in  making Governments bigger in taxing people more. He went on to  say th a t Labor would convince the electo ra te or would have to convince  the. e le c to r a te  that i t  should pay a h igh er-level of taxes, so that .

the Government sector could be increased under Labor. ‘ -

Many times Mr. Hayden has sp elt out what these taxes would be. Let..

me t e l l  you some .of. the things that he said. In 1978 he "emphasised"  th at he lik e d  the cap ital: gains tax because i t  was a neat : Â»

comprehensive system o f taxation. A year later he stressed  t h a t .... A   h is  Party was refin in g  th is proposal about a ca p ita l gainsÂ· tax  and then he sa id  q u ite b lun tly, we won't retreat from itV .In that ;;  speech he sa id , we propose,without any apology at a ll, the introduction  o f a. c a p ita l gains . tax, ajresoufce rental tax and a.-petroleum' revenue

tax, which Mr ? ; Keating had. said at one point would r a is e  more than Â·Â·  the present o i l  le v y , z Then:he capped a l l  th is by saying that, Labor. . ; ; would restru ctu re the tax sc a le s, making i t  clea r, ageing that he  wanted to  r a is e  more reven u e..

He was q u ite s p e c if ic . . Of course/ he s a i d , th ese are new taxes Â·  and they*re overdue ta x e s/ -iHe1  re intro ducting new taxes to avoid ..  jacking :up o ld  ta x e s / "Now norohe can say that they*ve not- been v i.  warned by the Labor Party spokesman themselves. They * ve warned us

time -and time a^ain-about- th elr: plans to increase the ta x a tio n :.  on. th e fa m ilie s,o n  the working men. and. women o f Australia; : . .  Â·* "  "  ‘ . .r Ã¢ÂÂ  "

iT / Mr. Hayden has m ade/explicit that tax on ca p ita l gains would be ...  le v ie d  on th e d ifferen ce between the amount the a sset was bought for  and what i t  was sold  fo r . Think what that means in rela tio n  to  your fam ily home, your holiday cottage or your boat. As i f  th is

tax grab were not enough, Mr. Bowen, the Deputy Leader of the Labor  Party, has alarmingly foreshadowed a wealth tax raisin g over  $3., 500 m illio n  and he did that in  s speech to the Amalgamated  Metal Workers Union.

Now a w ealth tax i s  one in which the value of a person's home, the  belongings th at go in that home, the value o f a person's savings  with a B uilding Society or a Savings Bank are a l l  added together  and each year you then pay a tax on th at, and i f  you're a small

business and you don't have a very good year, hov7 do you pay it?   Because i t 1s not a tax on p r o fits , i t ' s  a tax on the value of what

yoxi own. I f  you're a farmer, and you've had a bad drought year,  how-do you pay it?  By s e llin g  a paddock? You've only ju st got to  look a t i t  to know how h o rrific such a tax-w^uld be.

Those o f us who s t i l l  shudder at the thought of the Whitlam. years  when in fla tio n  got out of control, when wages sp ir a lle d , when  Commonwealth Government expenditure rose by over 467, in one year,, and

when ou).' income tax increased by 3.25% in three years, we need to  remember th at Hr, Hayden has said that the things he’s outlined  are more rad ical than what had been outlined up to 1972, ~

Only-a week ago, Senator Walsh from Western Australia - who’s a  spokesman for the Labor Party on primary in du stries, was asked  about the Labor Party re-introducing death duties. Is i t  a fa c t, * . the  in terview er sa id  and Senator Walsh’s treply was J it Â·  i s * ,

_  Blewettv.Xabor ’s spokesman on Health, stated  that there would be . a return to Medi Bank.and that i t  would be funded through taxation . ..
