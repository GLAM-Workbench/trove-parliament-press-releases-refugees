"Ms Steen's broad background in migrant and refugee women's  issues has been of great value since her appointment as  Migrant Women's Co-ordinator in my Department in November  1983." .

"Ms Steen's experience has included teaching English to  migrants in Australia, providing settlement advice to  refugees in Thailand, development of policies and programs  to assist migrants and refugees, contributions to multiÂ­
