PRIME MINISTER IN LAOS

Following is the text of an address by the Prime

Ministerp Mr WhitlamP at a luncheon given in his honour

by the Prime Minister of the Royal Government of Laos in

Vientiane on Monday, 4 February:

t !

I am obliged to Your Highness for giving me the

opportunity during my present journey to pay this visit to '

Vientiane and to renew an acquaintance begun when you yourself

were in Australia some years ago = I welcome too the occasion to

inform myself of the achievements and problems associated with the

long awaited return of peace and order throughout your country.

As you will know the Australian Government firmly supports the

principles declared in the Geneva Agreements, as to the national

integrity, independence and neutrality of Laos and looks to the

international community to endorse and to respect them.

subsequent Protocol in September of last year, seeing these as

highly important in themselves but also as encouraging and

heartening evidence of a spirit of goodwill, magnanimity and

co-operation among all parties in Laos - of willingness to pursue

a mutually acceptable compromise on the presiding interest, of a

genuine national reconciliation. I know how much importance you

personally have attached to this great objective of national

reconciliation and how much is owed to your wise judgment and

imaginative leadership in the progress towards it so far achieved.

Australia understands how much now has to be done to bind up the

wounds of war, to repair the loss and damage of so protracted a

conflict. All of us in this room are conscious of what the tragic

Australia welcomed both the February Agreement and the

I speak for all my fellow Australians when I say that

>Ã¢ÂÂ

events of the recent past have meant in terms of family

bereavement and human sufferings the painful reality which

underlies the macabre statistics of warÃ¢ÂÂ But we can '  '  ' : ' Â· Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·

nevertheless look forward with optimism to a brighter future .

for all the people of LaosÃ¢ÂÂ We can confidently expect that the

day is not far off when a Coalition Government can make a start

on harnessing national energies for urgent tasks of rehabilitation

and reconstruction,.

In this work all friends of Laos will wish to make some

contribution to promote the positive development of the talents,

and resources of all its peoplesÂ« My own Government stands ready

to take part in this common endeavourÂ« I believe that there are

areas in which Australian experience has already proved to have

particular relevance to the special needs of this countryÂ« as for

instance, in. afforestation and in pasture establishment under

tropical conditionsÃ¢ÂÂ In such fields we may be able to expand -

our present contribution, if you wish us to do s o ,  helping to

provide employment in the process to refugees and demobilised '

soldiers, and to lay foundations for the controlled development

of important national resourcesÃ¢ÂÂ We are happy too to continue'

our contribution to foreign exchange support for Laos = In ? trier

directions we look forward to purposeful and practical discussions

with you of ways in which you think we might help, and where we

would count it a privilege to serve. We are also interested in

exploring with you the possibility of an agreement to encourage

trade between our two countriesÂ« ,  .

Australia and Laos will both prosper best through a

combination of our own efforts and the promotion generally of a

helpful climate of international opinion and behaviour= We have

to be both, nationalist tand internationalistÂ« We see .Laos, as it

sees itself, as part of a region linked by geography, circumstance

and history, to the other countries of Indo-China but as a

neighbour also to Burma, Thailand and China= Laos draws a rich

and fascinating inheritance from all these associations, woven

into the fabric of popular life and furnishing the background

-of the national genius = Australia.Is a more recent neighbour

with a shorter, much shorter, awareness and experience of this

area., "but we accept fully and completely the extent to which .

our destinies are hound up with yours. They doth largely depend,

upon the degree of success that attends the labours of us all to

contribute to a peaceful world order and the prospect of peaceful .

access to a fair share of its resources for all its peoplesÂ» Â·

There could be no better example to present and future

generations of leaders in Laos, in Indo-China, and indeed, Ã¢ÂÂ

throughout the whole region of South-East Asia, than the Ã¢ÂÂ   '

unremitting labour Your Highness has devoted to peace. It is in

the hope of seeing extended the area of peace, of fraternal ’

dialogue and discussion, that I will leave Vientiane, heartened'

and encouraged by the conviction that the path of negotiation on

which you are now embarked is the right one for Laos, and for '  :

the region of which it is partÂ» We shall follow with the keenest

interest and sympathy the outcome of your endeavours and you.may ,

count upon, us for support in your achievementÂ» :  .  %

Finally on behalf of all in my party here today, may/' I Ã¢ÂÂ

express my deep appreciation of your generous hospitality to ;,‘

us all. I regret that circumstances have not permitted a.Â· longer' ,

stay and wider acquaintance with LaosÂ» We go away sorry that our

stay was not longer, but leaving our most earnest hopes and good

wishes for the future peace and progress, so earnestly desired.

by every Lao, which will represent the culmination of your .  -  :  .,  , . .

efforts as a statesman and peacemakerÂ»" .
