More Sri Lankans returned to Colombo  Thursday, 16 May 2013

A further 57 Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals have been returned to Colombo  after failing to meet Australia's international obligations, Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship Brendan O'Connor announced today.

A group of 32 people were flown back to Colombo Tuesday and a second group of  25 left Christmas Island yesterday, Mr O'Connor said.

Their removals take the number of Sri Lankans sent home to 1,130 - 919 of them  involuntarily - since August 13 last year.

'Returning these groups to Sri Lanka sends the powerful message that people who  pay smugglers are throwing their money away and risking their lives in the process,'  Mr O'Connor said.

'We are committed to breaking the evil people smuggling trade, deterring people  from taking dangerous journeys by boat and saving lives at sea.

'When people arrive in Australia without authorisation, any claims they make for their  reasons to travel to Australia are assessed by the Department of Immigration and  Citizenship.

'If these claims are not covered by the Refugee Convention, they will be returned to  their homeland wherever possible.

'There is no visa on arrival, there is no speedy outcome, and there is no special  treatment.

'We will continue to transfer people to Nauru and Manus Island.'

People returned involuntarily do not have access to reintegration assistance.
