Media must get access to offshore detention as  suicide attempts continue

It is clear that the media must be granted greater access to Australia’s offshore detention centres,  the Australian Greens said today after reports emerged from the Department of Immigration  regarding regular suicide attempts in the Nauru facility.

"The government’s policy is all about being cruel and mean and it has nothing to do with saving  lives," the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.

“The reports we’ve heard about today are truly shocking.

"It is unacceptable that a humane nation such as Australia is putting refugees into these harsh  conditions and then planning to leave them there for years on end.

“The media plays an essential role in our democracy and denying them access to the offshore  detention centres, which Australian tax payers are shelling out billions of dollars for, is a blatant  attempt to hide the situation from the public.

“The Department of Immigration had to be forced to release these documents and it makes you  wonder what else they are hiding.”
