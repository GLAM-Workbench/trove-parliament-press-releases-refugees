FORMAL COMPLAINT LODGED WITH AUDITOR-GENERAL



Independent  Senator  for  South  Australia,  Nick  Xenophon,  has  made  a  formal  complaint  to   the  Commonwealth  Auditor-General  over  the  Government’s  massive  advertising  blitz  on   asylum seekers.

A copy of the formal complaint is attached.

“Over the years, both sides of politics have used taxpayer money as a cheap way of funding  their parties’ ads. This campaign is one of the most blatant examples of this,” Nick said.

“The Auditor-General, as the watchdog for the use of taxpayer funds, ought to investigate this  as a matter of urgency.”

“The ads are directed towards people smugglers and unauthorised boat arrivals, yet they’re  appearing in Australian newspapers and on Australian television and radio,” Nick said.

“I  didn’t  realise  The  Adelaide  Advertiser had  such  a  huge  home  delivery  run  in  the  outer   suburbs of Jakarta.”

“It’s one thing to advertise a new policy where people smugglers are, and another to use this  as political propaganda at taxpayers’ expense in Australia,” Nick said.

“These ads are not aimed at people smugglers, they’re aimed at Australian voters.”
