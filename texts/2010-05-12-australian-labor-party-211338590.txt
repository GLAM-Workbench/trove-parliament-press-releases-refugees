INTERVIEW WITH LISA WILKINSON

TODAY, CHANNEL NINE

12 MAY 2010

SUBJECTS: 2010-11 Budget; asylum seekers accommodation

WILKINSON:

Treasurer Wayne Swan. Good morning to you Treasurer.

TREASURER:

Good morning.

WILKINSON:

Now, a big night for you - have you had much sleep?

TREASURER:

Not a lot, not a lot of sleep at all this time of year.

WILKINSON:

Ok, well there was a big weight on your shoulders handing down this Budget. The polls aren't great, no one likes the Prime Minister, as the Telegraph says - is this the Budget that's going to save your bacon?

TREASURER:

Well, this is the Budget that does the right thing for Australia. It brings us back to surplus in three years, three years early. It halves debt. Those two things are terribly important for all Australians; it recognises just how well we did during the global recession. We stimulated the economy, we've now got an unemployment rate that's the envy of the world, but what we need to do is to move forward, to bring our Budget back into surplus so we can maximise the opportunities that come from the return of growth.

WILKINSON:

The problem is you are relying very heavily on China and the mining super tax, neither of which are assured. They could leave you with a very big hole in these numbers if either of those don't happen.

TREASURER:

Ah, not at all Lisa, because first of all the Budget estimates are very conservative when it comes to China. We are experiencing a surge in the terms of trade but we are being very conservative about our terms of trade assumptions. But in terms of the Resource Super Profits Tax, that will make no difference to our bottom line or to our surplus. What we said is we'll dedicate every dollar of that to tax cuts for small business and to invest in super accounts, and if that tax doesn't pass, then those measures don't flow through to small business and to people with superannuation. So if the Opposition doesn't pass that tax, those measures don't flow, but we still come back to surplus in three years, and three years earlier, and we still halve net peak debt.

WILKINSON:

If a mining boom is going to help you pay off debts, unemployment is going to fall, so then how can interest rates remain steady?

TREASURER:

Well, that's the reason that we're coming back to surplus so quickly. This is the biggest improvement in the Budget since the 1960s. I think the Reserve Bank will most certainly welcome this very big fiscal consolidation, because what it means is that the Government is drawing less in the economy, or less from the economy, and making room for the private sector to expand, but also, we are making those investments in the productive capacity of the economy in skills and in infrastructure that put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.

WILKINSON:

A lot of your promises, Treasurer, are well into the future. Promises haven't exactly been this Government's forte. Why should families trust you again?

TREASURER:

Well, I reject that Lisa. We are delivering the tax cuts that we promised. We delivered three tranches of tax cuts over the last three years. They are modest but they certainly assist families. Last year we delivered the biggest increase in the aged pension in generations, we've delivered an Education Tax Rebate, we've delivered a very substantial increase in the Childcare [Tax] Rebate, we've delivered in terms of education funding and

the quality agenda in education, we've delivered on infrastructure. We've got a very proud record of delivering across the board, but most importantly, one that really counted: the stimulus that we put in place saved this country from recession. A stimulus which of course was opposed by the Opposition and had they been in power, Australia would have been in recession and unemployment would have been far higher, so too would have budget deficits and debt.

WILKINSON:

Not a great record on childcare though, Treasurer, 250 child care centres that you promised in the last election haven't happened. That's a recent promise that's been broken. While we're on families, tens of thousands…

TREASURER:

Can I just, can I just deal with that, Lisa? Can I just deal with that?

WILKINSON:

Well, I think it's been dealt with.

TREASURER:

I think we have a very good record.

WILKINSON:

Well, it hasn't happened, Treasurer.

TREASURER:

I'd like to respond to your assertion. I'd like to respond to your assertion because essentially the very substantial increase in the Childcare Cash Rebate has been of tremendous benefit, and we didn't proceed with all of those childcare centres because there was a big change in the childcare market, and you might recall what happened with the collapse of ABC Childcare Centres - a very big change in the market. So we took the responsible action not to proceed.

WILKINSON:

Well, tens of thousands in this Budget are going to see their childcare rebate cut by $300 a year. Just as the cost of child care rises, some will be paying up to $130 a day. What do you have to say to them?

TREASURER: Well, the maximum rebate is $7,500 per child. That's what we promised in the last election…

WILKINSON:

That is a cut of $300.

TREASURER:

…and that is what we are delivering. There's a small cut at the very top of that, yes, from $7800 to $7500, that's right. And there are lots of cuts in this Budget, because that is one of the ways that, through that discipline, we bring the Budget back to surplus in three years, and three years early.

WILKINSON:

Well, one very definite area where there's been cuts is the environment. A year ago, the Prime Minister called the global threat to the environment the greatest moral challenge of our time. This year, nothing but cuts. The Government is looking a lot like it's swinging in the breeze on this. Was Penny Wong the first Minister you told to go away?

TREASURER:

Well, I don't accept that characterisation either, Lisa. I mean the point is…

WILKINSON:

What part don't you accept?

TREASURER:

Well, all of it. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has not proceeded because it was blocked by the Liberals in the Senate on three occasions. We have a very substantial record of investing in renewable energy, and we've built on that record in this Budget with a new $600 million fund, to direct it towards energy efficiency initiatives for individuals and large-scale projects.

WILKINSON:

Well, health reform is the centrepiece of this year's Budget, and yet there's no allocation for dental care or mental health. This has got to be very disappointing for the 650,000 people sitting on waiting lists for public dental and mental health. It was one of your main priorities at the last election. Surely these areas are crying out for help?

TREASURER:

Lisa, there has been an absolutely massive increase in health funding in this Budget, absolutely massive. A very big investment in extra doctors

and extra nurses, in GP clinics, in GP super clinics, in private care, in emergency departments, and so on and so on. We may not have done everything in health, but given where we've come from in health, a very big package which is going to be of enormous benefit to tens of thousands and millions of Australians.

WILKINSON:

Well, you certainly have no shortage of support from your own Party. We want you to take a look at what was happening behind you last night.

[VIDEO CLIP]

WILKINSON:

It must be nice to have the troops behind the Treasurer.

TREASURER:

It's always good to have a few friends.

WILKINSON:

Now finally, yesterday it was discovered that 79 asylum seekers who are yet to be processed to bypass Christmas Island and instead are staying at the four-star Palms Hotel in Boondall in your electorate of Lilley. How do your constituents feel about that?

TREASURER:

Well, the first thing I'd say is that they have been there for some time. This has been normal practice under previous governments, and it's a practice under this Government, that when they've had their very stringent health checks and their very stringent security checks, if they can't be accommodated elsewhere, they're accommodated in this accommodation until they're finally processed. That's what's been going on there at the Boondall Palms Hotel.

WILKINSON:

Ok, and just very finally, Britain's got a new PM this morning, announced just over an hour ago. Any thoughts for him?

TREASURER:

Oh well, we wish them well. You know there're some very big economic problems in Europe, there's a very big challenge for the new Prime Minister in Great Britain.

WILKINSON:

Ok, Treasurer we'll leave it there. We do thank you very much for your time this morning. Over to you Carl.
