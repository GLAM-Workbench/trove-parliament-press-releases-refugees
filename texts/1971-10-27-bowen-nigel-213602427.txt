STATEMENT MADE TO PARLIAMENT ON 27-10.71 BY

MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS., THE HON. NIGEL  Â·  BOWEN, Q.C., M . P . -

EMERGENCY RELIEF AID

"I rise to make a further statement on the  question of emergency relief aid. Honourable Members.are.

aware of the problem of refugees from East Pakistan, which  has now assumed such enormous proportions..

.  .  From the beginning of this problem, the

Government has kept closely in touch with the situation  and has been in contact with local authorities and United

Nations authorities. .

The Government's initial contribution was promptly  made. The position continued to deteriorate. On 8 June

following an announcement of additional aid by the Prime  Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr.Bury),

referring to this grant, said in.these emerging and rapidly  changing conditions,  it was important to keep the priority

needs of the refugees constantly under review.

V

.  The Government has carried on this close review  'of the situation and has responded to the deteriorating

situation by grants, which now total $3 million. UnfortunateÂ­ ly. the political situation, which has produced this great

humanitarian problem,has so far eluded solution. The  position now.is that there are some 9 million refugees

in need in India and a great deal of suffering and distress  also in East Pakistan. The Government in pursuance of its

constant review and assessment of the situation and having

in mind what it believes to be an international obligation  of this country in this unfortunate situation has now

decided to make a grant of additional aid amounting to  $2.5 million of which $500,000 willÃ¢ÂÂ be a direct cash grant

to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The remaining $2 million will be allocated in a flexible

way to the provision of urgently needed items. We will  be consulting with the local and United Nations authorities

before deciding on the specific ways in which this amount  will be spent. Â·

It is not just a matter of agreeing to provide

funds. It is equally important to ensure that these funds  are employed in bringing relief effectively to refugees,

who are most in need. Our High Commissioner in India, Mr Shaw, has been keeping in close touch with the Indian  authorities and has been making regular on the spot

investigations. Having now decided to make a further  substantial grant of aid we will be following the matter

up through him. We are proposing to have Mr Shaw return  shortly to Australia to report to us. on this matter and

to receive briefing as part of our continuing review.

The Government's record in providing aid to the  area has been a good one. We sought to control our aid in .

a way which has ensured that it reached the area promptly,  that it was in a form which matched the needs and that it

efficiently reached those for whom it was intended by Â·

delivering it as required at Calcutta and upcountry

airports. Indeed we received commendation from the

Indian authorities, which came forward in a message from

which I quoted in the House on. 18th August. I think  this bears repeating:

I said: .  .  :

.  ’Although relatively.small in magnitude

Australia's timely refugee relief has been greatly

appreciated by the Government of India and by the

. Â·  Government of the States directly concerned. This  gratitude has been expressed on numerous occasions by

Indian Ministers and.senior officials, both privately  and publicly. Apart from the humanitarian aspect of the

relief aid our contribution has had a very valuable impact  on Indo-Australian relations generally, out of all proÂ­ portion to its magnitude. We were correct in our early  decision to deal directly with the Indian Government,

to consult with it about, what was wanted and where it was

wanted. Each air lift of our.relief supplies was well-  planned and executed. Thereby we avoided the delays and

frustrations suffered by other governments and agencies.

.  Moreover Indian Government officials had the feeling that

we are working with them and not supervising or directing  them and we have been overwhelmed with thanks.'

This was a rather lengthy message and I shall

skip some of it but it also states:

'The plastic polyfabric material supplied by  Australia was particularly successful. 'We have inspected

camps largely constructed from it in Tripura, Assam and  West Bengal. It has saved many lives and international

agencies and other donor governments are now providing  similar material. And as for our medical supplies, they

have been well-selected, and packaged and are being put j

.to good use.1  .  1

We have continued this policy and as lately as

the 24-th October have received a further warm commendation  from the Indian authorities. In a message received on

the 24-th October from Mr Shaw the following passage occurs.:- '

1  During official talks last week Foreign  Secretary T.N. Kaul and Secretary of Economic Affairs

I.G. Patel both thanked Australia for its prompt and  effective refugee assistance which they described as

1  exemplary1. 1

This amount of %2ÃÂ /ÃÂ¶ million which I have just  announced is additional to the existing aid estimates for

1971/72. The Australian Government is not diverting aid  from any other area or country in providing this assistance '

which will bring the total of the Government's emergency '

relief to the area to $5Â·5 million since last May.

The private contributions of citizens and

organizations have to be brought into account in order to  obtain a full picture of the total Australian effort. I

would like to pay a tribute to the generous spirit with .

-which Australians have responded to the appeals. On the :

figures available to me as at 24-th September an amount Ã¢ÂÂ

approaching Â§2 million in cash and kind had been sent to

India. .

The question of providing relief for the refugees "

has been recognized as an international one. The GovernÂ­ ment acknowledges its obligation to make a significant '

contribution to the international effort. The major .

economic powers and the major donors of aid to India,

like the United States and Britain, are making the largest  contribution to the international relief effort.

5

Â·  The Government's record in providing aid for the

refugees has been a good one. .

Australia's performance since May in responding  to this situation places us in fourth position amongst

donor countries, when our aid is assessed as is normally  done, as a percentage of gross national product.

.  I believe it is a concern of all Australians  that in aid matters it is ‘performance that counts, not

promises. It has been a disappointment to Australia that  for the past four calendar years from 1967 to 1970 the total

volume of official development assistance from all countries  ^ who are members of the Development Assistance Committee

(DAC) of the OECD has remained static. This has become .

known as the problem of "aid fatigue" in the major donor  countries.

But Australia's aid has not remained static.

During the same period our aid has in fact increased. j

I believe Australia can be proud of its aid record.

In the situation which faces the world on the .

Indian sub-continent, relief aid can deal only with a  symptom of a deeper trouble. This is not the occasion to

deal with the deeper problems, which are causing, this -human '   suffering. Honourable Members are aware of the situation Ã¢ÂÂ

and I referred on the 18th August in this House to some  of the initiatives being.taken by the Government in an attempt

to influence constructive moves towards a solution. The  hope of the Australian Government is that in the face of this

tragic situation enmities will be set aside and strenuous

efforts will be made by those in. authority to bring about an  early solution. We shall certainly continue our own efforts

towards this end.

In the meantime, the need for aid relief will continue

and the Government will maintain its constant review of the  situation." .  ,  .  .
