LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

27 July 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MR CAM MCKELLAR,  SPRING RIDGE, NEW SOUTH WALES

Subject: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; visit to Tamworth; the National Broadband Network.

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m here with Cam McKellar on his Inveraray Downs property near Spring Ridge on the Liverpool Plains to  inspect the work that Cam and other farmers in this area are doing to increase the carbon content of their  soil. Two things are happening here: first of all, as a result of this kind of organic farming, we are increasing  agricultural productivity and that’s good for all Australians. Second - and in the context of the carbon tax  debate perhaps more importantly - we are finding a way to reduce our emissions without jacking up  peoples’ cost of living, without adding dramatically to power prices and gas prices.

So, this is really important for the future of Australia, what Cam and thousands of farmers like him are doing  right around Australia now. If the Prime Minister really was still wearing out the shoe leather marketing her  carbon tax, she would be coming to places like this and she would be witnessing what people like Cam are  doing and she would start to understand why people are so unhappy with her carbon tax and why the more  she talks about her carbon tax the more people understand that there is a better way. I can only assume that  the Prime Minister has stopped her ‘wear out the shoe leather’ tour and thrown away the shoes because the  more she talks the more she’s finding that people think her tax is just toxic.

Cam, do you want to say a few words?

CAM MCKELLAR:

Alright, Tony. Well firstly, thank you and welcome to Inveraray Downs, this is your second visit here. We  just feel we’re doing the right thing, obviously for our own business, but the benefits and the flow on  benefits of that for the environment and the community much wider than that are fantastic. We’re just  finding that our soil life is improving, our soil carbon is improving, the nutritional integrity of the food that  we’re producing which you guys eventually eat is improving. So it’s a win-win situation all the way around.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the great thing about this, of course, is that you’ve been doing this for quite a few years now without a  carbon tax. Now, a lot of smart Australian enterprises are doing things to improve their efficiency, to

improve their productivity, to improve their bottom line. They’re doing all this without a carbon tax and I  think a lot of people are going to find it harder to do if this carbon tax comes in.

Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

Did you let Tony Windsor know that you were going to be in his electorate at this point?

TONY ABBOTT:

I did indeed. I let him know as a courtesy that I was going to be in his electorate.

QUESTION:

And what was his response?

TONY ABBOTT:

I haven’t had any response.

QUESTION:

Should he be here at this time?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Tony Windsor has indicated that he is supportive of the carbon tax. That’s disappointing to me and I  think it’s disappointing to his constituents, but I don’t regard this debate as over. I’m perfectly prepared to  come in to this or any other electorate and debate the carbon tax and I would suggest to Tony Windsor that if  he could get his mate, the Prime Minister, to turn up in Tamworth I’d be more than happy to debate her.

QUESTION:

We’ve seen a steady stream, I guess, of Coalition MPs visit the area over the last few weeks. Can we expect  more visits to come?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh look, I don’t see why not because it’s in electorates like this that the focus of the carbon tax fight is  going to be. If we are going to stop Australia from getting a carbon tax we need to persuade members of  parliament who are currently lining up behind the Prime Minister to think again. I think that Tony Windsor’s  electors will be giving him a pretty clear message at the moment that they don’t want this carbon tax and  there are certainly lots of Labor members of parliament who are hearing from the coalminers, from the  farmers, from the manufacturing workers of their electorates that this tax is just toxic.

QUESTION:

Do you now have this seat in the Coalition’s sights?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that this is a conservative electorate and I think it should be represented by a conservative  member.

QUESTION:

Do you think Tony’s committed political suicide by going the way he’s done?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, members of parliament are entitled to make their judgments and they’ll live or politically die on the  strength of the judgments they make.

QUESTION:

The forum tonight in Tamworth, what’s that about?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as far as I’m concerned it’s an opportunity for the people of Tamworth and the surrounding areas to  tell me what they think. It’s not confined to the carbon tax by any means, but certainly I’ll be talking about  the carbon tax and I’ll be telling people that this carbon tax is going to hurt their cost of living and it’s going  to hurt their job prospects.

QUESTION:

I understand there’s 200 people going. Who is going and are they invited guests? How did they get to go?

TONY ABBOTT:

My understanding is that Senator John Williams invited hundreds if not thousands of local people. Because  the hall where it’s being held has limited accommodation, limited seating, I understand that people have  been accepted on a first-in best-dressed basis.

QUESTION:

So you don’t necessarily have to be one of your supporters to go?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not. No look, you know, dozens and dozens of community groups were invited, hundreds if not  thousands of invitations were sent out and the people who responded most swiftly were the people who were  accepted.

QUESTION:

And what are you hoping to get out of it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again, the same as I’ve got out of forums right around the country since the election but particularly  since the Prime Minister’s carbon tax was announced. I want to hear what people have got to say to me. I  hope people will be receptive to my message. Certainly, the message that I’ve been getting loud and clear  from the Australian people is that this tax is just toxic. They don’t like it and that’s the reason why the Prime  Minister seems now to be confining herself to Canberra. She went to the National Press Club last Thursday,  she went to a school last Friday, she went to Tasmania to talk about forestry on the weekend, she stayed in  Canberra to talk about boat people on Monday, yesterday she went to Melbourne to talk to Tony Blair. It

seems that the last thing she wants to do is talk to the Australian people about her carbon tax and I can only  assume that’s because the message she’s getting from them is that the tax is toxic and the more she talks  about it the worse it gets for the Government.

QUESTION:

Back to the forum tonight, did your office have any say in who was invited or have you left it in the hands  of…

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve left it entirely to Senator Williams.

QUESTION:

The NBN hacker into the network, what’s your opinion on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

One of the dangers with the National Broadband Network is that greater centralisation does expose our  system more to this kind of problem. Now, hacking is always a problem but the more concentrated our  system is, the more damage any single hacker can do.

QUESTION:

So when the system is up and running, is this likely to occur again?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, it depends on the sorts of safeguards that have been built in but if those safeguards are  penetrated, well then obviously a hacker can do more damage if the system is concentrated.

QUESTION:

I’ve just got two questions for you. The first one, on your last visit a year-and-a-half ago you did say that  you believed that mining and agriculture can co-exist. What’s your take on that now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I still think it’s important that we have a dynamic mining sector and a dynamic agricultural sector but  I’ve got to say that I am concerned about proposals to mine prime agricultural land. There’s a lot of land  which obviously isn’t prime agricultural land, but prime agricultural land is an asset for thousands of years.  Once it’s mined it’s no longer prime agricultural land and so I’d like to see mining flourish and I’d like to  see mining expand but not in the first instance on prime agricultural land.

QUESTION:

Also, with your proposal with the carbon reimbursement to producers like Cam, how would that affect local  farmers in our area here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I’d like to see is the possibility of people who are going to increase the carbon content of their  soil receiving some kind of assistance from government and the emissions reduction fund that we would set

5



up under our direct action plan would certainly allow people who, like Cam, are significantly increasing the  carbon content of their soils to get significant and substantial support from government. Now, I appreciate  that people like Cam have been doing it for years and they’ve been doing it because it made economic sense  for them without support from government. That’s one of the reasons why I think we can get very  substantial carbon abatement from soil carbon because this is something that makes economic sense already  for many farmers and with quite comparatively modest payments from government I think we will see a lot  more people taking it up.
