INTERVIEW WITH LYNDAL CURTIS

ABC RADIO AM PROGRAM

3 NOVEMBER 2009

SUBJECTS: Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook; Newspoll

JOURNALIST:

Treasurer welcome to AM.

TREASURER:

It's good to be with you Lyndal.

JOURNALIST:

You've got good economic figures to trumpet, but isn't the reality for people that they won't  feel much like celebrating because they're facing higher interest rates - likely to get even  higher today - at a time when their working hours are still lower than they'd like.

TREASURER:

Well, Lyndal I don't speculate about interest rates; they're matters for the independent  Reserve Bank board. But the Governor has made the very obvious point that interest rates  cannot continue to stay at 50-year lows forever. But I think Australians can be proud of  what they've achieved through this global recession, and what we have achieved is the  fastest growth of any advanced economy, lower unemployment - bar one - of any advanced  economy, with lower deficit and lower debt. So I think Australians have had a pretty good  bang for their buck in terms of economic stimulus.

JOURNALIST:

But higher interest rates are a side-effect of that success - aren't they? And business too  will have to cope with them, and a rising dollar. Is the prospect that, unlike previous  downturns where the struggle afterwards was to get jobs back, that in this one the struggle  will be to get those working hours back?

TREASURER:

Well Lyndal interest rates are something like 350 basis points below their peak under the  Liberals. So interest rates are low by historical standards. The Reserve Bank Governor has  made the very obvious point that as the economy recovers, then of course interest rates will  begin to rise. But they are still very low by historic standards, and many Australians are  benefiting from those very low rates. But, of course as the economy begins to grow, fiscal

stimulus is gradually withdrawn and, of course, the Reserve Bank independently takes its  decisions about the future course of monetary policy.

JOURNALIST:

You decided to give your stimulus spending a trim yesterday but not a big cut. Is the  decision to cut back on the stimulus in the wake of better economic prospects still too hard  of a decision to make?

TREASURER:

We've taken the hard decisions and, of course, in this Budget we've offset all new spending.   But the stimulus is still very, very important, because if you have a look at all of the data  contained in the update, you'll see that the investment outlook, private investment outlook,  is still weak. You see the very big hit to national income that comes from the cut in prices  that we are receiving for our commodities.

Unemployment is still expected to rise, and as you have correctly identified, there are many  people out there that are working less hours. If you look at the reduced hours that  Australians are working and you add them all up, that's something like 200,000 full-time

positions. So the economy is still operating substantially below capacity, and because of  that, we decided it was appropriate to continue with our stimulus, albeit withdrawn, as we  go through next year, to make sure that we can keep the doors of small business open and  do the maximum amount we possibly can responsibly to support jobs in the Australian  community.

JOURNALIST:

Did you consider though a bigger cut to the stimulus?

TREASURER:

We certainly had a look at the outlook. We had a good hard look at where the economy was  going internationally, we had a good hard look at what was happening domestically and it  was our judgement that we've struck the right balance by maintaining our stimulus which of  course is gradually withdrawn as we go through next year.

JOURNALIST:

Your Government has suffered a slump in the latest Newspoll - the first time the parties are  level pegging on primary votes since 2006. Is that because people don't like your asylum  seeker policy, or don't think you're handing it well?

TREASURER:

Well, I don't have to worry on a daily or weekly basis about opinion polls because what I'm  concerned about is the national economic interest. I've been concerned in the last 24 hours  with putting out our Budget update and, of course, I'm going to the G20 Finance Ministers'  Meeting in Scotland at the end of the week - they're the matters â€¦

JOURNALIST:

But don't you have to take heed of the sharp public reaction to a policy?

TREASURER:

The polls come, and polls go. They go up, and they go down. I don't take a great deal of  notice of them when they're on the upside, and I don't take a great deal of notice when they  go down. The most important thing here is to focus on the national interest, whether it's the

national economic interest, whether it's dealing with dangerous climate change, or whether  it's dealing with border protection.

JOURNALIST:

So you don't see any need to change any element of your border protection or asylum  seeker policy?

TREASURER:

Well, certainly we won't be changing our policies in response to weekly opinion polls. That's  not the way we govern. We govern in the national interest.
