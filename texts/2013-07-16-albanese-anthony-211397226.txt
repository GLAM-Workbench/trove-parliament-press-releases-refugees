TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH TONY JONES  LATELINE

SUBJECTS:                               Asylum seekers; Federal election; Climate  change policy; Automotive industry; Urban road  and rail funding



TONY JONES:                            Anthony Albanese thanks for joining us.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Good to be with you Tony.

TONY JONES:                            Do you know how many asylum seekers have died  at sea trying to get to Australia since Labor came to  power?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          What we know is that every death is one too many.

As we speak there is an incident this evening

about 100 kilometres north of Christmas Island. The  latest advice that I have at the time of this interview  was that there was an Orion aircraft monitoring the  situation and naval ships were on their way to the  vessel, which was upright.



TONY JONES:                            Well do you know how many deaths there have  been since Labor came to power, because you would  think that would be a number imprinted on the minds  of every policy maker?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Every single one is one too many Tony.

TONY JONES:                            Shall I tell you how many? The expert panel - your  own expert panel - detailed at least 612 drownings  from 2009 to 2012.



Add to that, according to good estimates, another

500 or more people who have died at sea. That’s  more than 1,100 deaths.



Are these deaths now building an ethical case for

drastic and radical action to stop the boats?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Certainly when we received the advice of the expert  panel that’s why the Government determined to adopt  its recommendations in full.



Now we were inhibited in doing that by the

parliament, and the failure of the Coalition and the  Greens’ political party to support those  recommendations.



The Government is now working through these

policy issues. We certainly believe that it is the case  that as the people smugglers’ model changes, so  must policy change.



So there’s no point in time in which you can say all

the work is done, and what you need to do is  constantly modify your policy to meet the changed  response that comes to those policy issues.



TONY JONES:                            I guess the question was, are the deaths, and the  growing number of them, are they actually creating an  impetus for urgent change?



Because as we speak you’ve said another boat is

reportedly in trouble at sea, an asylum boat capsized  yesterday, four bodies were recovered, more people  are believed to have drowned, then a baby boy  drowned at the weekend in similar circumstances.  Tony Abbott says this a national emergency, is he  right?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          These are terrible circumstances and that’s why  we’ve been prepared to countenance responses,  which frankly if you had of put to me the Malaysia  agreement for example ten years ago, I would have  told you that I would never have supported that.



The fact is that this has required a change in

response. We had an expert panel, including the  esteemed refugee advocate Paris Aristotle, chaired by  Angus Houston. I take those recommendations very  seriously indeed.



And indeed every one of these tragedies, we’ve

got to remember that whilst the people smugglers are  engaged in a trade that is beyond comprehension -  trading in human misery - these people are human  beings, every one of them is one too many, their  families would be grieving for them, and it does

require us doing everything we can to stop people  getting on boats.



TONY JONES:                            Is it time to stop being diplomatic with Indonesia and  demand that they do more to stop these boats leaving  their ports often, as we know, with the support of  corrupt police and officials?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          I’ve been to Jakarta four times and what I do know is  that foghorn diplomacy doesn’t work.

What is required is for us to work in a cooperative

way with Indonesia and to work in a way that respects  the fact that they are an important and friendly nation  to our north of some quarter of a billion people.



That they have a range of pressures that are on

them as well in terms of their own circumstances, and  I think that we’ve seen the Opposition’s simple three  word slogans rejected quite rightly by Indonesia.



It requires a much more sophisticated response

than that, and that is how the Government is working.



TONY JONES:                            Your Government has actually taken Japan to an  international court to stop them killing whales.

Is it time to take Indonesia to some sort of

international forum to stop the deaths of these people  who are leaving their shores in Indonesian boats,  crewed by Indonesians?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Let’s be very clear we have, in terms of the  agreement that was reached just over a week ago  with the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono  during those bilateral talks, agreed that a regional  discussion would be convened. That will be convened  in coming weeks.



It’s important that these measures be done in a

cooperative way. That is how the Government is  working. That is the appropriate way to operate in  these circumstances to achieve an outcome.



The outcome here isn’t trying to get a domestic

political message out there. The outcome is how do  we stop people getting on boats and risking their  lives? That is the Government’s objective, not any  simplistic three word slogans.



TONY JONES:                            Did you hear John Stanhope, the Christmas Island  Administrator, on the radio this morning?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:          No I didn’t Tony; I’ve been on a plane to Perth.

TONY JONES:                            No that was earlier this morning, before that. But he  sounded like a man at his wit’s end. He said they’re  getting 100 arrivals per day, 700 to 800 per week.  He’s got a baby in his mortuary; more bodies are on  the way.



Is it time to start thinking about this urgently, not in

terms of having discussions somewhere down the  track with Indonesia about what might happen, but  actually come to some decisions?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          We’re not sitting back doing nothing here, Tony. But  you can’t just issue a press release and the issue is  solved. You can’t come up with a three word slogan  and the issue is solved.



If that was the case, if it was that simple, it would

have been done. It isn’t simple; these are a complex  series of arrangements.



We know that in 2012 there were 23,000 people

displaced every single day. That was greater than the  number of people who sought asylum in Australia.



So we know that these are difficult questions

globally, they’re difficult in our region, we’re working in  our region to come up with ways to solve these  issues. We had the expert panel. We adopted the  expert panel’s recommendations in full-



TONY JONES:                            I’m sorry to interrupt you there, but Bob Carr your  Foreign Minister says that the vast majority of these  people are not displaced people at all, but people  seeking economic haven not political or other haven  from persecution in Australia. He’s saying they are  economic migrants basically on these boats for the  most part.



If you are prepared to make big policy changes in

that area in particular - not just campaign promises -  are you prepared to bring back parliament and  legislate for those changes before the election?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Parliament has met and considered a range of issues  and has been blocked in terms of the expert panel’s  recommendations in the past.



TONY JONES:                            I’m talking about your future policy, the initiatives  that you are apparently working on now that will  change the equation? Will you bring them to  parliament or will they just be campaign promises that  you take into a campaign without any legislation?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          There’s a range of things that can be done without  legislation, there are some things that need  legislation. That will be a matter for the appropriate  announcement by the appropriate minister.



And I’m not here on Lateline tonight frankly to

announce the Government’s policy when it comes to  migration. These issues are being worked through,  the Government isn’t just sitting back, the  Government has tried in the past to carry legislation  but politics has got in the way.



What is important is that politics get out of the way,

whether it be the Coalition or the Greens’ political  party, and that we have a comprehensive solution to  these issues.



TONY JONES:                            But the problem is now the election is getting in the  way, and all this is happening against the backdrop of  a coming election; no one knows when that is.



But the same thing applies to your promise to bring

the ETS forward. Is that just a campaign promise, or  are you prepared to bring back parliament and  legislate for that change before the election?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          I’m not going announce the election date tonight  Tony-

TONY JONES:                            I’m not asking you to do that, I’m asking whether  you are prepared to bring back parliament.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:         Yes you are Tony by asking me about whether  parliament will come back. It may well come back.  Parliament is scheduled to come back on a particular  date. If the election hasn’t been called by then, guess  what, parliament comes back.



TONY JONES:                            You’re a key strategist; wouldn’t it potentially be in  your favour to put Tony Abbott in a position where he

has to vote in both houses against a bill to end the  carbon tax?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Well I’ll give you the big tip Tony; I get to be a  strategist because I don’t discuss our internal strategy  on Lateline.



And I’ll give you another tip, it won’t be of surprise

if Tony Abbott does what he does best which is say  no, no, no to any plan that is put forward, even a plan  that’s going to lead to increases in living standards of  $380.



Tony Abbott has shown with the record number of

bills that were opposed by, what I say is the ‘Noalition’  for the last three years. They’ve opposed three times  more bills than have been opposed as a percentage  by any previous parliament. And that’s because  they’ve been prepared to say no to everything, and I  suspect that Tony Abbott would say no. He has said  that, why would you doubt him?



TONY JONES:                            To pay for this emissions trading scheme change,  you’re cutting the fringe benefit tax incentive that car  manufacturers say will actually hurt their sales.



Apparently the South Australian Premier Jay

Weatherill agrees with that - he’s coming to Canberra  to lobby against that change tomorrow. Did you do  any modelling at all before you brought this change in,  as to how it might affect car sales?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Of course we did modelling. Let’s be very clear about  what this change is. This change is for those people  who are currently claiming a 20 per cent use - sort of  statutory figure - of their work vehicle for work,  without providing any records.



So those people who are actually using it 20 per

cent of the time will actually not be able to get the  advantage they currently get from claiming something  they are not entitled to. It’s as simple as that.



No impact whatsoever on the tradies’ ute, no

impact whatsoever on anyone who uses their car for  more than one kilometre in every five. And no impact  for people who want to actually keep records for 12  weeks every five years, and these days there are  apps; it’s very easy to keep those records.



Let’s be clear, the only thing this is impacting on is

people who are claiming something they are not  entitled to. And it is beyond comprehension that that  would be a bad thing.



TONY JONES:                            What did your modelling tell you would be the

impact on car sales? Because manufacturers are up  in arms, Jay Weatherill is going to Canberra to lobby  against this. He believes it will have an impact on car  sales.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Well you’d expect people who have elections on, and  you’d expect from time to time when you make  savings decisions people will have issues with them.



But the only impact this has is on people who are

claiming something that they’re not entitled to. And it’s  consistent with good policy outcomes that anyone  when it comes to tax issues isn’t able to claim  something that they’re not entitled to, simple as that.



TONY JONES:                            Do you seriously believe that the only people  affected here are BMW drivers as you suggested this  morning, and you’ve been accused of simply a class  warfare attack for suggesting that.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          I didn’t say it was only BMW drivers, I said it was just  as likely because it was. This isn’t something that  impacts on just Australian cars. It’s competitively  neutral in terms of what sort of cars are given.



And I’ll tell you what, if you want to be fair dinkum

about making a difference currently we could make,  between Queensland and New South Wales for  example, half the fleet at least of both those state  government fleets Australian made cars.



If they want to make a difference, that’s the way to

make a difference in terms of Australian car  manufacturing. That would be a really sensible  change to make, and it is one that I would support.



And what you wouldn’t do is do what Tony Abbott

will do, which is to rip half a billion dollars out of the  automotive industry in terms of industry support.



TONY JONES:                            Alright finally you’re in Perth to announce funding  for upgrades to the city rail network. When did urban  rail become a federal funding responsibility?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          We’ve put in more money into urban public transport  since 2007 than all previous governments combined,  and tomorrow we’ll be opening up the new tunnel for  the Fremantle line into the Perth City Link project.



We’ve committed $236 million into what’s a $360

million project. It will be open tomorrow and we’ll be  travelling on some of the first trains.



Urban congestion is a big infrastructure issue. If

you want to look at productivity and benefit/cost ratios,  what comes out the end consistently is that the  Federal Government has to play a role in urban public  transport.



We’ve done that with this investment, and we’ve

also committed just here in Western Australia half a  billion dollars in the last budget for either the heavy  rail line, which is connected to the airport, or for the  light rail project here in Western Australia.



But right around the country we are investing in

urban public transport. Tony Abbott has said let’s just  stick to rural and regional roads and not worry about  urban and public transport.



Well if we are serious about infrastructure,

regardless of the mode, whether it be roads - and I  travelled here to the ABC studios along the widely  expanded Great Eastern Highway that was funded by  the Federal Labor Government as well, so here in  Perth making a big difference to urban congestion-



TONY JONES:                            I don’t want to interrupt your flow, listing every

single project you have to drive past or catch a train  along - I don’t want to be cynical here either - but are  you calculating there are votes in this in the west?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          There are votes I think in cities because people  understand that urban congestion is an issue that has  to be dealt with in terms of urban road funding but  also urban rail funding.



And there is a role for the national government in

urban planning and in dealing with urban congestion.  It would cost - it was estimated a couple of years ago  it would cost $20 billion to the national economy by  2020 if left unaddressed.



That’s why I’m very proud of our record in urban

rail. It’s the right thing to do, it’s what people who are  sitting in traffic, sitting in traffic who would like better  roads or like the option of a better public transport  system, know should happen.



TONY JONES:                            Anthony Albanese, we will have to leave you there.  We thank you very much taking the time in Perth to  join us on Lateline tonight.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Thanks very much Tony.
