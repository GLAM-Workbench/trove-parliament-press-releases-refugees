E&OE………………………………………………………………………………… PRESENTER:

It’s time to bring in our Big Guns of Politics this morning - Labor MP Kevin Rudd and Shadow  Treasurer Joe Hockey. Gents, good morning to both of you. Kevin, I’ll start with you. Like it or not,  you're the subject of this leadership speculation. You say nothing has changed from your previous  statements - I want to play you one of those. Here is what you said on the 22 of March when  Simon Crean called for a leadership spill.

Kevin Rudd March 22, 2013:

I have said time and time again that I would not challenge in the future for the leadership of  the Labor Party. I believe in honouring my word. As I have said in a written statement earlier  today, there are no circumstances under which I will return to the leadership of the Australian  Labor Party in the future.

PRESENTER:

So Kevin is it there are no circumstances under which you'll return to the leadership? Will you  honour your word?

KEVIN RUDD:

As I said then and I’ve said ever since, I don't believe there are any circumstances under which that  would happen. The election will be between two parties, two leaders with two different visions for  the country's future. Can I just say…whether it is the end of 2007 when you had all the speculation  about Mr Howard and 2010, a whole lot of speculation about me. Now there is a whole lot of  speculation about Prime Minister Gillard - there is something almost inevitable in the political cycle  about these things.

PRESENTER:

How frustrated do you get with all of this? If you are saying you are going to stick to your word,  under no circumstances - and you have constantly said it - why do you think the papers are still full  of it?

KEVIN RUDD:

I don't believe there are those circumstances and look, you know what politics is like.

PRESENTER:

What circumstances?

KEVIN RUDD:

I don’t believe there are any circumstances under which that would occur. You know what politics is  like. You go into the building - Parliament House Canberra - or you go into a state parliament  building and we talk about politics all the time. I think the country just has a gutful of it. The country

want to know frankly how do we pay the bills this week. Secondly have the kids got a decent school.  Thirdly can I get into accident emergency if there is a problem. That is the basic stuff which we  should be attending to. And when it comes to an election it is about choices in those two areas, Tony  Abbott's vision versus Prime Minister Gillard's vision for the future.

PRESENTER:

Can I ask you this - sorry Joe I promise I’ll be with you in a sec - but Kevin, Bill Shorten has been  excluded, according to 'The Australian', excluded from Julia Gillard's strategic decision-making  because there are fears that he might have switched sides. Kevin, is Bill Shorten now a Kevin Rudd  supporter?

KEVIN RUDD:

So you are asking me whether Mr Shorten is in the internal deliberations of Prime Minister Gillard  within the Cabinet? I haven't been in the Cabinet since February of last year; you may remember  covering those events. I have no idea about any of that. I am just getting on with the business of  being a local member of Parliament.

PRESENTER:

Has Bill Shorten rung you and said ‘Hey mate, you have got my support.”?

KEVIN RUDD:

I have received no such telephone call from Mr Shorten and I talk to these ministers.

PRESENTER:

Any other contacts?

KEVIN RUDD:

We have been physically in the building and we have been seen at the coffee shop at Parliament  House in Canberra together, at least three weeks ago. I had a chocy biscuit, he didn't, so I think  there’s significance in that as well.

PRESENTER:

Joe, you are sitting there quietly. What do you make of this?

JOE HOCKEY:

What do I make of all this? It is a circus.

KEVIN RUDD:

Here we go.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it is a circus. This is Groundhog Day. Kevin said previously “there are no circumstances”, now  he says "I believe there are no circumstances." These are weasel words. At the same time,  Australians are saying “What the hell is happening to our country?" The economy is coming off,  people are losing their jobs, they are unable to pay the bills and this is Groundhog Day in the Labor  Party where they are spending all their time talking about themselves, worrying about who is going  to have what job, rather than worrying about the jobs of everyday Australians. It is pathetic and it is  insulting for the country.

Let's finish on something that is being done. The Prime Minister heads to Indonesia next month…

KEVIN RUDD:

Thanks for the positive review, by the way Joe.

PRESENTER:

For annual talks with the President there - asylum seekers top of the agenda. Kevin, the Indonesians  seem to have thumbed their noses at us and doing absolutely nothing to stop the boats, despite all our  foreign aid going there. What can you do?

KEVIN RUDD:

It is important for the Prime Minister to maintain regular contact with President Yudhoyono. The  question is what practical programs have you got in place to reduce the outflow of asylum seekers.  Never forget in Mr Howard's day you still had two or three hundred boats arrive in Australia. You  had 13,500 asylum seekers come by boat. You had only four of those boats turned back, by the way,  at sea - back to Indonesia. These are complex things but bear in mind this. There are 230 million  people who live in Indonesia. It is one of our closest neighbours. We have a big national interest in  maintaining a good relationship with Indonesia. We have a challenge with asylum seekers now. If  there was a political implosion in Indonesia and you had 230 million people up there who suddenly  needed to find stability elsewhere, frankly for Australia, this is core business and I am very glad the  Prime Minister is going to Jakarta.

PRESENTER:

Right Joe, I’ll give you a chance to respond there.

JOE HOCKEY:

Since Kevin changed the laws as Prime Minister, 44,000 people have come on boats. In the last year  of the Howard Government, two came. I heard him just say 200 boats. Well that was over 11 years  and we stopped them - we stopped the boats. Kevin changed the law.

KEVIN RUDD:

Before they were recycled back into Australia.

JOE HOCKEY:

44,000 people have come on more than 700 boats. It has cost the Budget...

KEVIN RUDD:

You didn’t stop the boats. They went through Nauru back into Australia.

JOE HOCKEY:

It has cost $10 billion for the Australian economy and they are still coming at three times what the  Budget expects.

PRESENTER:

But Joe, you can't tell us you that the boats are going to stop day one you are going to get in.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, day one? Give us a few days Kochie, but I tell you what, we are going to stop the boats.

KEVIN RUDD:

How many will there be Joe? Year two, year three. Tell me.

JOE HOCKEY:

We are going to implement temporary protection visas which Labor won’t accept and won’t do.

KEVIN RUDD:

How many will you turn back?

JOE HOCKEY:

We will turn back where it is safe to do so. We will do it because we have done it before.

KEVIN RUDD:

Mr Howard turned back four out of 250.

JOE HOCKEY:

And Kevin, in 2007 you said you would turn back the boats.

KEVIN RUDD:

Four, he turned back.

PRESENTER:

Okay, gentlemen.

JOE HOCKEY:

On a happier note, can I just say, I'm really sorry that Mel is going and I got her some flowers. I got  you some flowers. But because you are not here in Sydney, I am going to give them to someone else  in the news room, I’ve decided.

PRESENTER:

Such a charmer.

PRESENTER:

Thank you! I am taking a holiday and I’ll be back after holidays…

JOE HOCKEY:

Her name is Boris over here.

KEVIN RUDD:

Mel, Joe and I are taking you to lunch, please come back. That's all.

JOE HOCKEY:

At the Lodge? Kevin, at the Lodge?

KEVIN RUDD:

He'll bring flowers. Joe will pay.

PRESENTER:

Are you saying Kevin would win the election, Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.

PRESENTER:

That’s what he said…

JOE HOCKEY:

I’m just saying move fast on that dinner or that lunch.

PRESENTER:

One comment and look how that gets moved on. Thank you both very much; I appreciate your kind  thoughts. Take care. You have a good weekend.
