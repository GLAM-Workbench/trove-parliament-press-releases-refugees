NEWS RELEASE

DEMOCRATS WELCOME RW ANDAN EMERGENCY A ID

The Australian Democrats have welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement of  increased aid for the Rwandan crisis. The additional $6.5 humanitarian aid brings to  $10 million total aid provided by Australia for this catastrophe.

Senator Vicki Bourne, Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the Democrats said: "Nobody  could deny that the situation in Rwanda and along the Zaire border merits Australia's  largest single emergency aid contribution. It is entirely appropriate that the  Government's response should reflect the scale of the tragedy.

"At the moment refugees' immediate medical needs are paramount. I am pleased  Australia's contribution includes 300 mostly medical military personnel.

"Basing these medical personnel in Kigali is a necessary step in preparing Rwanda for  the eventual return of its people.

"Australia must do its part to handle the current emergency as well as preparing for  the longer term problems of the nation, such as famine prevention.

"Another long term challenge and obligation for the international community is to  ensure that disasters of this nature do not occur again.

"The United Nations is the obvious body to deal with such issues. In this and other  cases, its inability to effectively do so stems from its desperate need for guaranteed  funds and the need to update its modus operandi  and efficiency.

"All this is quite possible if the political will exists. W e can only hope that the  devastating scale of this disaster provides that impetus.

"There must be no more Rwandas."
