TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here today with the Shadow Treasurer, my friend and colleague, Joe Hockey. It’s now fifty  days until Budget day - fifty days when the government has got to put the chaos of last week behind it, it  has got to put the division and self-absorption of last week behind it; focus for once on the Australian public,  focus for once on the national interest and actually put together a responsible, honest budget. This, unlike  previous budgets from this government, has got to be an honest budget. It's got to be a budget that tells the  truth and calls it for Australia, without cooking the books, without fiddling the figures and above all else  without playing the class war card which Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson so decently and honestly  warned us about last week.

Obviously, it was a bad week for the government and frankly a bad week for Australia last week when you  had two of the most respected people in the Labor Party, two Labor Party elder statesmen, say that what our  country needs right now is consultation, due process and above all else, a Labor government in the tradition  of the Hawke/Keating Government which for all the mistakes that it made was a government which didn't  ever deliberately set out to divide people and that's my great fear, over the next fifty days that this  government will find its ‘them’ and ‘us’ instincts reinforced; that they will continue to play the class war  card even more fiercely in the future than they have in the past and I humbly request the Government to  learn the lessons of last week, to heed the good advice of Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson, to harken to  the best traditions of the modern Labor Party: look to Hawke and Keating for your inspiration, try to put  behind it the dissension, the bitterness and above all else the division of the last few months and years.

The other point I should make before asking Joe to offer some more detailed observations on the state of the  budget and what the Government needs to do, is to say that this is quite a challenge for the Government  given that the budget will be prepared with some of Labor's most respected and most competent members on  the backbench rather than on the frontbench.

It is going to be very much an L-plate Cabinet. There will be people in the Cabinet who will be confronted  with budget-making for the first time in their careers. One of the most distressing features of last week is  that Chris Bowen was the fifth small business minister under Julia Gillard and we're now going to have the  sixth small business minister under the current Prime Minister, and that's a pretty dispiriting situation for

small business to be in. Small business is the creative heart of our economy. Small business people who put  their houses on the line so they can employ people have got to be at the heart of our economic strength and  yet this government will be giving them the sixth minister in just three short years.

So, the portents are not good, but for our country's sake, the Government does finally need to rise above the  morass of last week and govern for all Australians.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks very much, Tony.

As Tony has just said, we expect this budget to be for all Australians and not special interest groups. At this  critical point in the economic cycle, it is vitally important that it be an honest budget. Every budget should  be honest but we will be benchmarking this budget on the integrity that it has and whether it is going to be a  refreshing change in the approach of the Labor Party and be honest: honest in the budget assumptions on  revenue, honest in the budget forecasts particularly in relation to economic growth. That is hugely important.

Special areas we'll be looking at will be revenue forecasts for both the carbon tax and the mining tax. The  carbon tax forecasts are currently that from 2015, it will be based on $29 a tonne which was the estimate for  Europe. Currently Europe's trading around $5 to $6 a tonne so we expect there to be a significant write-down in the $9.4 billion of revenue forecast in 2015.

The mining tax obviously is not going to raise anywhere near the revenue that was originally forecast in the  Budget. We’ll be looking carefully at that and in relation to asylum seeker costs, the total for this year is  $2.8 billion, the blow-out so far has been $6.6 billion. Now, recently the Government said we’re going to be  cutting $2 billion a year out of our forward estimates for dealing with asylum seekers but in the last ten days  alone, 14 boats have come, which makes a mockery of them writing down the cost associated with asylum  seekers. We also will be looking carefully for money shuffling and a further example of the money shuffling  was lost in the mayhem of the Government’s own problems last week where the spectrum sale worth $3  billion was delayed from this year until next year. So, even if revenue had have been what the Government  projected, even if they had no one to blame for not getting to a surplus this year they would never have got  to surplus because the spectrum sale that was worth $3 billion to them this financial year has now been  delayed.

We will also be looking at the major new initiatives, the Gonski education reforms and the National  Disability Insurance Scheme. The Government can no longer fudge it by claiming to deliver the schemes  and then have a token amount compared to what the real cost of the schemes are in the budget. So, we will  be making sure that the full funding plan for both Gonski and the NDIS is in the budget in fifty days' time  and that means going beyond the forward estimates. They need to lay down the six to eight year costs when  it is at full operational level. They need to say how they expect to pay for the full operational costs of those  programmes.

We'll be looking at the structural savings and it's hugely important after the Government has introduced 27  new or increased taxes in the last few years, that they don't just default to tax increases and new taxes, but  they actually do something about getting rid of the waste.

Finally, we will be looking at their strategy just to stop increasing the debt. You will remember they  originally said debt would get no more than $75 billion. Then they said no more than $200 billion. Then no  more than $250 billion. The debt cap is $300 billion. We want to know what the real debt cap is going to  have to be, what the real level of debt that Australians are going to confront over the next few years is going  to be. No more games about debt. The Government has to have a plan to deliver a surplus and start to pay  down debt because only when you deliver a surplus do you stop borrowing, do you stop actually paying  down the debt.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] you mentioned the term L-platers before. Do you worry that rather than being dishonest  [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you've obviously got a Shadow Cabinet inside the Government sitting on the backbench. This is a real  problem when you have got your most respected, your most senior talent sitting on the backbench not the  frontbench. Now, let’s wait and see what the Prime Minister announces later on today but we know for a  fact that it will the sixth small business minister in less than three years. Now, that's a terrible indictment on  this approach to economic management because small business has got to be at the heart of our concerns, if  we are to have a strong and prosperous economy.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the Gillard Government appears to be rewarding unions in all the right places. Does this stir  something within your own mind about industrial reforms?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I'm not against unions. The Coalition supports honest, responsible unionism, but unions should not be  dictating to the Government any more than business should. It's got to be a government for everyone. It's got  to be a government for all Australians. The Hawke Government understood that. Even the Keating  Government understood that. This Government has completely forgotten the best lessons of recent Labor  history and that's why so many honest Labor people are so dismayed at the score settling and the ‘them’ and  ‘us’ mentality which seems to afflict the Government right now.

QUESTION:

Mr Hockey, if the Government does seek to increase the debt ceiling, would you support them in that?

JOE HOCKEY:

We will always look at the proposal, we have always been reasonable about it but we want a fair dinkum  approach to what the debt is going to be and given the history of the massive increases in debt against their  own claims of what the debt would be; so we've gone 75, 200, 250, now $300 billion and we're fully  expecting that they're going to come back to the Parliament and seek to have the debt cap lifted well above  $300 billion, maybe to $400 billion, maybe even more. But we want them to be honest. I think Australians  deserve an honest budget.

QUESTION:

You wouldn't block it?

JOE HOCKEY:

We are not in the position of blocking things unless there are major concerns.

TONY ABBOTT:

If I may add something, this is one of the things that we will be looking at as we consider the timing of a no-confidence motion in the Government. Now, there will be a no-confidence motion put on the notice paper in  Budget week, because it is time for the Australian people to have their say. We've had the faceless men,  we’ve had the back-room deals, now the Australian public deserve their say. The longer this government  lasts the more damage it is doing to our country and to our economy and these are the sorts of things that we  would be looking at in the context of the precise timing of a no-confidence motion, exactly what they tell us  on Budget night. If the Government decides that they yet again have to lift the nation's credit card limit, if  the Government is deciding that after promising until they were blue in the face that there will be a surplus,  that they can't ever deliver a surplus or they can't deliver a surplus within a reasonable time frame, obviously  that feeds into our considerations in terms of the precise timing of a no-confidence motion.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, will you have to win over the independents again in the next six or seven weeks or do you think  their minds are made up on this?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is interesting that even the independents are talking about the possibility of supporting no-confidence.  Andrew Wilkie has certainly left open the possibility of supporting no-confidence. While Mr Oakeshott and  Mr Windsor have been reluctant supporters of a no-confidence motion in budget week itself, they've  certainly left open the possibility of supporting a no-confidence motion after budget week and I would urge  all Members of Parliament but particularly the independent members of Parliament to talk to their own  people in the fifty days leading up to the budget, ask the people of Australia, what do you want? Do you  have confidence in this Government? Do you think that this Government can be trusted with your future?  Do you think that you want a strong and stable government now or are you prepared to wait another five or  six months until the election which the Prime Minister says won't happen until September 14? If the  independents persist in supporting the current Prime Minister, it will be very hard for them to claim to be  genuine independents. They will be more pro-Gillard than Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson. I mean,  Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson have effectively voted no-confidence in the Prime Minister by their  actions last week and if after everything that’s happened they still say under no circumstances will we  support a no-confidence motion or under these circumstances we won’t support a no-confidence motion,  well, they will be labelling themselves as more pro-Gillard than Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you’ve been calling for an early election for some time now. Wouldn’t an early election be even  more disruptive to the Budget process?

TONY ABBOTT:

What we are saying is that we will table a no-confidence motion in Budget week. So, we’re not proposing to  table a no-confidence motion until Budget week and we will be carefully assessing the quality of the Budget.  We will be carefully assessing the quality of the Budget in terms of the precise timing of when that comes  before the Parliament.

But I’ve said from the word go, certainly I’ve said since the Prime Minister indicated that there would be a  carbon tax despite all of her talk that there would never be a carbon tax, that the Government’s problem is  not simply that it lacks a majority, the Government’s problem is that it lacks integrity. Now, it’s lacked  political integrity ever since that infamous day in February of 2011 when the Prime Minister went out there  with Bob Brown presiding and said well, sorry voters, sorry people, I told you before the election to win  votes that there wouldn’t be a carbon tax and now in order to hold my job I’m giving you a carbon tax.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, when a man who has said horrible things to and about women turns up at the Prime Minister’s  residence in Sydney and she invites him, what do you say to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m just not going to get into that. Look, I don’t…

QUESTION:

Do you think it goes to her judgement?

TONY ABBOTT:

…I think there are many, many issues that go to the Prime Minister’s judgment but this is the least of them.

QUESTION:

Mr Hockey, RBA Governor Glenn Stevens is looking for reappointment this year. Is that something the  Opposition would support?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, the Opposition would expect the Government to consult them about this, otherwise we’re not going to  get into speculation about who takes what job but given the Prime Minister’s already set the date for the  election and given that Governor Stevens would in effect be starting a new term, or whoever’s appointed  would be starting a new term after the election, it is one of those appointments that we would expect a  decent an honourable government would consult with an opposition about no matter whether they were  Labor or Liberal.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, will Mr Hockey still be Treasurer if you win government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course. Look, I’ve got a very good team - a very, very good team - and the fact that there has been such  stability and continuity in my team under my leadership is a sign that I have confidence in my team, unlike  the Prime Minister in hers. I think this today will be the sixth ministerial reshuffle under this Prime Minister.  I’ve had a few minor adjustments but I have tremendous confidence in my team and the stability that there’s  been in my team is a sign that they are doing their job.

Thank you.
