TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP

SOUTH PACIAC FORUM  1 AUGUST 1994

PM: Thank you for your introductory remarks. I think the first thing ( would  like to say is that we've had an excellent day of informal discussions  at the Leaders' Retreat This is a day without officials, so that it's not  as rt there is the distraction of, rt you like, documentation and notes et

cetera in the course of presentations and discussions. Rather, an  informal discussion where the leaders can sit down and discuss  problems and review the progress of the region. Now, we had a long  discussion this morning about economic growth rates in the region,

about per capita GOP growth rates retative to other similar regions in  the world, looking at ways in which we might improve our economic  performance, looking at some of the inhibitions to thatÃ¢Â‘ economic  growth and deciding that in some areas we ought to focus again on  the theme of the conference which is resource management, or how  to manage resources better. So, we had quite a lengthy discussion  about fisheries, airlines, forestry, tourism et cetera. And also - I'U  come back. to those in a moment - also, we agreed to re-appoint the

Secretary-General, leremia Tabai, and to decide that the Forum next  year will be held in Papua New Guinea, and the year atter that in the  Marshall Islands, and the following year, in the Cook Islands. So, I  think that the forum has produced some substantial outcomes and let

me just go to them.

In fisheries, leaders have agreed on the merits of a multi-lateral  approach to negotiating access to their exclusive economic zones on  the basis that they can better and adequately improve the terms by  negotiating on a multi-tateraJ basis, and where we believe existing  bilateral arrangements are adequate, they can be maintained in a

multi-tateral context. This, I think., would be a substantial departure  from the nature of bilateral arrangements between Pacific Island  countries for the exploitation of their economic zones with some of  the major flSh-consuming nations, and that the aim would be to lift

income in the area for what is one of the largest fishery regions. and  fisheries, of the world. So, we've agreed to agree on the merits to a  multi-tateral approach and we'll be using our, we believe we need to

strgngthen our forum fisheries agency capacity :50 it can ensure more  effective n~tional control and m3fk1gc~nt of the region's fi:sheries .  So , that of course will Qr\Sue in the next y~r.

On airlines, there was o en era I agreement about the need to deal with  airline losses and the combined airline losses of the P~eific area now  equate to the aid whlct\ Is being provided by both Australia and NQW  Zealand, wh ich means there's a very large drain on the net income of

Pacific (.sland countries, So, we 8greed to look at the airline losses to  examine the option for a rationalisation of air servic::es among Forum  island countries, perhap3 on a ~b-regionaJ basis. That is, on a basis  where air routo and air route management would be in zones that  m~de senSQ in terms of r~, access, seNiee, price etc. Taking into

account. of COUr'SQ , the needs of sub-economic clients, that is, the  needs of some distant island countries where the service will be  perpetually sub-9conom ic.

On forests, leaders have agreed to take furtMr steps to prevent  unsustainable rates of logging and to ensure a reasonable return to  land owners and governments. During the afternoon, Prime Minister  Hilly and I made a separate statement and some Important

commitments which will 8S3ist Solomon Islands to manage its fon;Ss  more 8ustainably And, as a consequence of that. leaders strongly  exprQ$~ a strong concern about the exploitation of tropical fo~ts

in the region and welcorTlQd the recent initiatives by Vanuatu and the  Solomon Islands to halt the spread Of unsustainable Jogging practices  - fnduding the introduction of independent monitoring systems and  an agreement on the 'need to secure better and adequate returns for  the exploitation of this resource for national income purposes. The  forum also endorsed the undertaking of leaders to the Melanesian

spearhead group to examine uniform legislation procedures and  practices in forest resources -and there, Australia - and I Ulink New  Zealand -have offered assistance -Mlere that may be valuable.

We also had 8 diSC1.Jssion about the contnbution which tourism ean  make to the economies of the region sand noted, in partiaJiar, the  need to protect the region's fragile coastal zones so that, again, with  :some fOQJS on the need to maintain coastal zones and also to try and

adOpt beUer coastal zone management prac:t1ces wherever it's  possible, for some assistance lo be provided there. The recent report  by the Australian Resource Assessment Commission has led to a  number of eonclusiorl3 and recommendations, which may have  application to the Pacific Island states, and the Government of  Australia has provided a booklet which is a guide to where these  sorts of servicas might best bQ QUisted in Australia, or from Australia,  but with a renQWed emphasiS on the nQQ(j to preserve attractive  coastal zone regions. I think it was in that vein that Prime Minister  Hilly made hi:s ~nnounc:emern about the Marova Lagoon, which is, of  course, one of the most attractive regions of the wtlole PaCifIc. And, I

t  "

think it bodes well for the under.standing which leaders have, or the  na&d to protect import~ parts of the environmenl

So, could I just sum up by saying that I think it's boen a very  productrve day. Coming to conclusions about such things as  fisheries, th@ n~ to lift mrtional ineeme from thom, airlines, tho nG~  to reduce the call on national budgets, forestry - the need to, again,  11ft natlonal income and take steps to prevent unsuNinable rates of

logging - was, I think. a very good and important outcome of the  meeting. And, of course, we will go into formal session tomorrow.

J: Prime Minister, Chris Hammer rrorn SBS television, this new flshlng  arrangement, could that be de5cribed in any way as a cartel  mrcmgement?

P: No. I think that it is important for wealthy nations like Japan and  South KorcaQ to understat\d that they CQn't secure valuable ~urces  at sub-economic rates of rQtum. And, what the existing mrangements  have shO'WTl is there has bean a considerablca QXploitation of PacificÃ¢Â‘

Island countries, under-reporting of captures, insufficiQf'\t monitoring -the multilateral nature Is not simply for any negotiation But, rather,  also to look at fish stcx::ks, the prospects for aquaculture in adding to  fish stock.s and, also, better monltorlng and better reporting so that  these small states can get a better return from their valuable, and one  of their few, natural resources.

J: Mr Keating, 1m1 McPhredran from the Canberra Times. I'm wondering  if you expect any sort of a backlash from MalaY$ia on the issue of  environmQntal, combating environmental piracy, and .will you be  raising thQt matter with Or Mahatir or President Suharto in the future?

P: I haven't mentioned Malaysia but I've just said that I think the  imponant thing is, that, again, Pacific Isl~ companies are not  exploited by unscrupulou~ companies who then, not only pay  inadequate rates of return but also carry out IO~JOjng practices which  would not be tolerated in a developed forestry OJlture. Now, I think  that, an understanding by wealthier countries who use these

resources and who exploit them, of the smaller countries. is  importanl And, whether, at the moment, of cour$e, many of these  companiQs Qr8 Malaysian companies and Korean companies and  also some Indonesian companiQS. B4't, whOGYer the compani~  belong to, I think that they should be encouraged to be good  corporate citizens, to not see an opportunity for exploitation arise and  then take It to the full. At any r=lte, the national govemmCHrts involved  here are concerned about rates of exploitation and modaJities of  forestry and are obviously takir19 remedial steps to change it.

J: Kalinge Seneviratne from IPS Newsagency.

PM: VVhere are you from?

J: IPS Newsagency . Australia has been very strong on asking the  Pacific Island nations to restrid logging because of its environmental  impact Now , also, now some of the foreign countries are going to be  wiped 'out from the map in a couple of generations because of the  greenhouse emissions and rising sea levels. As the Chairman of the

Forum and also as Australia is one of the major users and supporters  of coal, for example, would you, Australia, be willing to take the  initiative at this Forum to offer restricting mining and export of coal  and if not, would Australia also be willing to consider opening up the  borders for environmental refugees from the South Padfic?

PM: Well, I don't, that's a very broad question. Let me tell you this though,  that Australia 's interest in this matter is not so much protection  against global warming. That is, the implication of your question is  that the forestry, Australia'S moves on forestry. are self interested

ones which go to the international environment in which it lives. Well,  this is not so. I mean, that is a natural interest, but the predominant  interest is seeing a sustainable rate of exploitation of forests in the  Paclfic Island countries, because at the current rate of exploitation

these reserves are going to go. But, not only are they going to go, but  in the doing of it the exposure to high rainfall of the resulting terrain  will mean that a lot of the topsoil will end up in coastal waters and in  lagoons and in reefs, and affect the fishing stocks as well. I think that  Australia's interest in this is to see that a. that there is a sustainable  basis for a logging; b. that the environmental despoilation is one  which is contained and manageable, and c. that national incomes are  rising. We are not doing this because of what one may see as some  threat to Australia in global environment terms. Now, the subject of  our greenhouse gas emissions and water levels is a subject way  beyond the capacity for me to detail at a press conference like this

and involves, of course, commitments by other countries and the  whole progress of international climate change conventions and the  commitment to those conventions by the major developed countries.

J: Craig Skehan , from AAP. To what extent do you accept that  corruption by some Islands' officials and politiCians has been a large  contributing factor to unsustainable agreements in resource areas  such as forestry. Was that discussed today at the retreat and, what

measures could be taken at the regional level to deal with corrupt  practices in resource areas?

PM: Well it was disrussed today, but I couldn't say to what extent That is  a cause of the rates of exploitation and modes of exploitation on now.  I think a lot of it is, perhaps a lack of comprehensive understanding of  the impacts of the agreement of logging licenses and exploitation  rates, wtIic:h may seem feasible at the early stages of the exploitation  of a forest, but then seem more worrying later. I think that's what has

5

happened now, and given the fact that at least two of the island  states have now taken action to introduce moratoriums on further  explOitation in" certain regions and articuiated a willingness to  renegotiate licences, I think gives an indication that whatever is the  reason for the permissible exploitation as to date, that's now being  reviewed. In the case of Papua New Guinea , of course. Papua New  Guinea is a much larger country with a much deeper resource base  and a multi faceted resource base and has much more of a capacity  therefore to be able to make judgements or professionaJly manage  the development of resources and to deal with the more predatory  behaviour of particular resource exploitation companies.

J: Victor del Rio from Eco Television in Latin America Mr Keating,  about three months ago t attended a conference in which they were  inviting mining companies. Australian mining companies to invest in  Latin America, and during the conference they said that Latin  America was surprised because of the few restrictions that the

........ environment using another task force. Is Australia willing to put  some kind of code of ethics to the Australian companies, when they  are investing in regions like latin America to stop this pradice of  using the " .. in Latin America?

PM: Well, I am not aware of where one may say Australian companies  have, as a class of investors, exploited regions. They will certainly  exploit mineral and other opportunities in various parts of the world,  but. I should hope their intemationalcorporata citizenship and their  regard for the interest of other countries and their communities is as  high as their regard in Australia Thafs not to say that any reaJm of  commerce unfettered, and certainly unfettered by commitments of a  company to best practice in, particularly in resource exploitation.  won't be important So at this stage, I don't think we have seen the  case for Australia needing to say to its corporations that there should

be a code of condud under which they observe, but I don't tpink you'll  find an example of an Australian company that's involved in the  wholesale exploitation on an unsustainable basis and despoilation  that causes concern in this context. Now, I mean, I'm sure all

companies around the world can be better corporate citizens and you  can take environmental concerns to the nth degree. It's all a matter of  what the proponents are prepared to do, what the licensing authority  wishes, and in that case it's mostly national governments. what their  concerns are. By and large, I think irs fair to say, Australian  companies will take heed of concerns expressed by national  authorities about particularly large extracting developments. I mean, f  wouldn't think, . in fact I know of no Australian company, certainly a

major one, involved in wholesale exploitation and under reporting of  income. and that's one of the problems here.

J: Janice .. from Radio New Zealand. Mr Keating, the decisions on the  airlines today, will this, do you expect closure of some national flag  carrying airlines?

PM: Well, I think it means that there is a willingness on the part of the  leaders to think about ways in which, I mean. let me put it this way.  what they are interested in is air services. not airline ownership  necessarily. They are interested in the provision of air services and  air services at an effective and efficient pricing. Now, whether that  can be done. by, if you like, Pacific sub-regionai carriers who service  a region of the Pacific including those places which will always

remain sub-economic, or whether in fact this will need to be carried  on National budgets, is a moot point Thafs the point that needs to  be, that will be examined. I mean, I think what may arise, is that, sub " Pacific carriers could service a region and even so in some areas it  will be completely commercial, in others it will be sub-economic, but

not requiring the subsidies of the magnrtude they require now. So it is  that willingness to look at multi-lateral, multi-lateral regional solutions,  and the drain on budgets which, I think, is causing leaders to  consider such an outcome, such an approach.

J: Richard Breeze from AFP. Very simple question, you mentioned that  the combined losses of these airlines equalled the aid given by  Australia and New Zealand. Would you care to point out an  Australian dollar figure on that?

PM: Its around about $100 million or thereabouts. That is the combined Ã¢Â‘  operating losses of the eleven airlines, which is around about. a bit  over $108 million dollars.

J: Mr Keating, Sid Marr, Brisbane Couriar Mail. How would the fishing  contracts. the new multi-lateral fishing contracts be policed?

PM: Well, already the Forum Fisheries Agency has the capacity for some  monitoring facilities and as you know that one of the reasons why  Australia has developed a Pacific patrol boat program is for policing  of maritime areas and maritime boundaries. But again, one of the

things that the review can address is how there cim be better  monitoring and policing, and of course, with better income, all this  becomes more possible. I mean the fact is, I think many countries are  not receiving adequate returns and therefore, of course, diminish any  on budget costs for surveillance et cetera, a more mature strudure  aJlows for that. and I think that's the point

J: I'm Gladis Nofkin from the National (inaudible) Mr Keating, the  FLNKS delegation to the Forum were, yesterday, prevented from  attending the opening. Is there any reason why, and also what is the  Forum stand on the FLNKS issue push for self detennination?

7

PM: Well, that's not being discussed today, I C2rl only say that, well, the  reason they did not attend Is because they are not members, that's  the reason, and, but again, there Is a dose, a relatively close  association be~n Forum mem~ and that organisation, and of  course, that will be seen tonight, at toniQhrs dinner which is being  held, ~md which Forum representatives will be attending.

J: Mr ~ting, Susie Grey from Fifi National Video Centre. I was just  wondering if our Prime Minister, Mr Rabuka. spoke to you about  SPARTECA Is there ic any possibility of Australia following New  Z~land's example of ~ 5% reduction in rules of origin.

PM: No, I haven't had a discussion with thQ Prime Minister on this  occasion. I did at the last Forum, I think. thQre hac been somo talk  between our countries over the course of the last yQar. and there was  I think, some fear in Fiji that Australia was going to, if you like,

toughen the conditions under SPARTECA Of rules Of origin. That is  not so, but nor have we made them more concessionaL I mean rules  of origin exist for e purpose. If gocx:I:; are being made In terms of the  rules in Fiji there is not a problem in Australia

J: Mr Keating, do you have anything te say on Mr Downer's comments  today on Aboriginal he~1th and your govemment'~ record on thal

Issue?

PM: Welt. rll just say this aboUt Mr Downgr, the thing is ~ the Liberal  party has again, the Uber:al party of Austnalia, the conservmive party  of Australia has again demonstrated that it has no philosophy for  office. It has no policy virtually on Austr:alia's tdentity, It claims to  support the constitutional monarchy, It then says it's irrelevant and to

be ignored. It seeks to deny justice to mdlgenous Australians by  saying it would overturn the historic Mabo agreement It's not for  AJexander Downer to say what Aboriginal people hold dear. and like  most indigenous communities in the Pacific the spiritual link between  AbongiMI people and Isl~er people and the land is a profound

one. and the right to their tradition~ way of life and happirles$ is tied  up in their access to land. It is not simply about health and education.  These are functional issues which are dealt with under functional  approprimions from the Commonwealth either through ATSIC or  directfy. A reliance on health and education by Mr Downer is simply  an obfuscation for 8 policy to try and remove the opporrunny for  indigGnous AustT3lians to have access to land via Mabo. And, it  means that Mr Oowner is being run by the worsl elements of  conservatiVQ Austroalia and they, among3t other places reside in a  very generous measure, of course, in the state of W~tem Australia.  Shame on him, Shame on him for contemplating it. So much for Mr  Downers freSh start.
