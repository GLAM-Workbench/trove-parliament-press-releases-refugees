SENATE ESTIMATES COMMITTEES

LABOR’S WASTE AND MISMANAGEMENT



A week of Senate Estimates has exposed even more waste and mismanagement  from this Labor Government adding to the Billions of Dollars that Labor has wasted  on failed schemes, botched plans and blatant wanton spending of taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money.

As Australia struggles to keep its head above water, Labor is drowning the Nation in  debt.

Here are just some examples of Labor waste and mismanagement which was  uncovered by the Coalition this week during Senate Estimates.

From $100,000 splurged on fake kitchens for a Carbon Tax advertising campaign  that didnÃ¢ÂÂt mention the Carbon Tax to $20,000 spent on coffee machines, $21,000  spent on a single dinner for bureaucrats and $50,000 Ambulance trips. $700,000  spent engaging 17 lawyers to work on the Slipper/Ashby Case, not to mention  $30,000 for a portrait of the disgraced Speaker and over $1,000,000 spent on  accommodation for the Ambassador to Rome.

This is just the tip of the iceberg!



Asylum seeker numbers & costs explode  More than 7,200 asylum seekers arrived by boat in the first three months of this  financial year - five times as many as Wayne Swan estimated when framing his  Budget. The budget estimate of $1.1 billion was based on an average of 450 arrivals  per month but actual arrivals are running at an average of 2,400 per month.  While departmental officials refused to be drawn on the cost of the Budget blow-out  we do know that in 2011/12 every boat that arrived cost taxpayers $12.8 million, or  more than $172,700 for every person on board.

Pink batts frauds repeated for solar panels  The Clean Energy Regulator is investigating more than 60 cases of alleged fraud  relating to the Small-scale Technology Certificates (STC) program.  Under the program people who install solar panels to generate power for their hot  water systems and heat pumps are able to claim Government discounts for each  megawatt hour of electricity produced.  The investigations relate to fraudulent claims that solar panels have been installed  when, in fact, they have not been installed.  The 60 cases under investigation look like being just the tip of the iceberg, with the  Regulator admitting that most STC frauds relate to multiple households.  These frauds bear all the hallmarks of the infamous Ã¢ÂÂpink battsÃ¢ÂÂ affair, where  installers fraudulently claimed rebates for installations that were never made.

Indigenous Boarding Schools Not Built  Five years on, Indigenous communities are still waiting for two out of the three  promised Indigenous boarding facilities promised by Labor in the 2007 election.  While Wadeye has been completed, construction at the other two facilities - at East  Arnhem and the Walpiri Triangle - has not even begun, and the Government has no  idea when work will commence.

Former Speaker’s $30,000 portrait  Peter Slipper may be gone as Speaker but heÃ¢ÂÂs still a burden to taxpayers.  Senate Estimates heard that a $30,000 portrait of the former Speaker will be  commissioned to hang in ParliamentÃ¢ÂÂs Kings Hall.  Mr Slipper gets to choose the artist.  Given his liking for the trappings of office,  taxpayers will be waiting breathlessly to see how he is robed when he is  Ã¢ÂÂimmortalisedÃ¢ÂÂ.

Coffee machines & the wine cabinet  Climate change must be thirsty work.  Presumably thatÃ¢ÂÂs why the Clean Energy Regulator has installed eight Nespresso  coffee machines at a cost of $20,175, one for each of its eight staff kitchens.  And the Department of Climate has issued a tender to purchase a stainless steel  wine cabinet as part of the $20.5 million fit-out costs for its plush new building in  Canberra.  Unlike the coffee machines, the wine cabinet is solely for the use of those staff lucky  enough to have access to the executive dining room.  That may be galling to non-executive staff, but not nearly as galling as it will be to  taxpayers contemplating the effect of the carbon tax on their electricity bills.











G4S to run Manus Island processing centre  G4S, the company behind the security debacle that threw the London Olympics into  chaos by failing to supply enough security guards, is set to run the Manus Island  processing centre.  Manus Island is due to be operational and receive its first detainees within a matter  of weeks.  Fingers crossed that the Government doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have to call in the Army to ensure  security as had to be done when G4S failed in London.



Costly Kitchens for a Costly Tax  Senate Estimates has heard that $79,700 was spent building three fake kitchens for  the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Carbon Tax advertising campaigns.  Using real kitchens would have cost $5,000 a day.  The cost of shooting the first round of Carbon Tax commercials was $350,000 and  $340,000 for the second round.  ThatÃ¢ÂÂs before buying any airtime.  Estimates also heard that the Government is planning another round of advertising  to sell the Carbon Tax Labor promised not to introduce.  And in anticipation of that  the creative advertising agency involved has had its contract increased by 50% to $3  million.



More Budget fiddles  In another financial fiddle, 97 quarantine staff have been shifted from Ã¢ÂÂairportsÃ¢ÂÂ to  Ã¢ÂÂcargoÃ¢ÂÂ to help the Government meet its Budget targets.  And the reason?  If the staff work in Ã¢ÂÂairportsÃ¢ÂÂ they are a cost to Government.  If they  work in Ã¢ÂÂcargoÃ¢ÂÂ costs are recovered from the industry.  Once again the Government is trying to lower its costs by handing the bill to industry.



Pink batts scheme’s costly legacy  LaborÃ¢ÂÂs disastrous Home Insulation Program has so far cost taxpayers $2.15 billion  in installation and clean-up costs over four years.  The scheme, which was first announced in February 2009, was wound up less than  a year later having been plagued by fraud and safety problems.  After being linked to four deaths and at least 200 house fires the Government was  forced to pay for 250,000 inspections of installations already carried out.  The latest revelations show that the original scheme left behind 2494 bad debts  totalling $34.5 million, while the subsequent Insulation Industry Assistance Package  - designed to help legitimate businesses recover form the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs disastrous  intervention - has left a further 58 debts totalling $5.45 million.

Europe to set Australia’s Carbon Tax rate  Climate Change bureaucrats have confirmed that Europe will effectively set the rate  of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs Carbon Tax.  At the same time, the secretary of the Department of Climate Change has refused to  endorse the accuracy of Government/Treasury estimates that the carbon price will  be $29 per tonne in 2015, saying only that it was “not implausible”.  Equally, the Department said that a price of $50 per tonne was “not completely  inconceivable”.  The truth is that Australians could be paying anything for electricity under LaborÃ¢ÂÂs  carbon tax.  The Government has out-sourced AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs carbon tax to the Europeans.  The  price will be set in Brussels, not Canberra, and there will be no consideration of the  impact it will have on Australian families and businesses.

Captain Emad’s family still here  While Captain Emad (aka Abu Kalid) fled Australia on 5 June, the day after the  ABCÃ¢ÂÂs Four Corners revealed the notorious people smuggler was pushing  supermarket trolleys in Canberra, his family is still here.  Captain Emad arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2010 and was given a protection  visa.  His wife and three adult children and their dependants arrived by boat in 2009, were  granted refugee status and settled in public housing in Canberra.  Now, five months after Captain Emad fled, it looks like his family may be going back  too.   Compared with the three years it took to investigate Craig Thomson, thatÃ¢ÂÂs  quick work!

How Many Lawyers does it take to …

The Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) admitted at Estimates that 17 of its own  lawyers worked on the James Ashby / Peter Slipper case at various timers over the  past six months, three of them full time.

In addition, two barristers were engaged, one of them paid at $4,800 per day.  The CommonwealthÃ¢ÂÂs legal bill exceeded $700,000.  All of this for a case which the  Commonwealth finally abandoned and settled for $50,000

Government raids Medibank Private  Coalition Senators at Senate Estimates have uncovered a Government plan to rip  out a $300 million “special dividend” from Medibank Private to help achieve Wayne  SwanÃ¢ÂÂs fictional surplus.  Unlike the Government, Medibank Private actually delivered a surplus last year,  although not enough to fund LaborÃ¢ÂÂs $300 million cash grab.  Medibank Private needs its capital reserves.  They were developed on the back of  the health insurance premiums paid by its members and milking them will add to  pressure on premiums.





NDIS - Where’s the money coming from?  The Secretary of the Department of Finance confirmed at Estimates that there is no  funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) beyond the forward  estimates.  It turns out that the Government has provided only a quarter of the money needed  for the first phase of the NDIS and nothing beyond that.  The NDIS is just one part of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs $120 billion budget black hole resulting from  promises made but not properly funded.

Dinner is served  The Federal Government may be $147.3 billion in debt but that didn't stop it  spending $21,000 on just one dinner.    The dinner at a Fremantle hotel was held during meetings of the Indian Ocean Tuna  Commission.  More than 170 delegates, advisers and bureaucrats from around the country  attended the conference but it is not known how many of them attended the dinner.  Even if they all turned up the cost would have been $135 per head.  The dinner was listed as a Ã¢ÂÂbusiness costÃ¢ÂÂ, not Ã¢ÂÂhospitalityÃ¢ÂÂ in departmental accounts.



Airfare to Nauru - $7,692  Immigration officials have revealed that about $2 million has been spent flying 260  asylum seekers from Christmas Island to Nauru - an average airfare of more than  $7,600 per asylum seeker. By contrast, QANTAS are advertising return Sydney to  London flights for less than $1,800.ItÃ¢ÂÂs worth remembering that every boat that  arrived in 2011/12 cost taxpayers $12.8 million, or more than $172,700 for every  person on board.

Defence White Paper 86% unfunded  Defence officials have confirmed in Senate Estimates that the $200-$230 billion cost  of buying the capabilities outlined in LaborÃ¢ÂÂs 2009 Defence White Paper Force 2030  is almost completely unfunded. In addition, the White Paper promised 3.0% real  growth in funding every year to 2017-18 and 2.2% real growth beyond that.  Those  promises have now gone by the board.  Instead, Labor has syphoned off more than $25 billion from Defence, using the  money to prop up the BudgetÃ¢ÂÂs bottom line.



The lights are on but no-one’s at home   The Pontville Detention Centre near Hobart, where the lights blaze brightly every  night, is being maintained on a contingency basis even though the last detainee left  on 6 March and Minister Bowen announced it had been decommissioned.  With more than 7,200 asylum seekers arriving by boat in the first three months of this  financial year, and every other detention centre bursting at the seams, looks like  Labor may need to recommission Pontville before too long.

World’s most expensive ambulance trips?  Meanwhile, questioning at Senate Estimates revealed that the Government paid the  Tasmanian Ambulance Service $543,000 for what turned out to be eleven trips to  Pontville - a cost of $49,363 per trip.

Albanese ‘adjusts’ departmental answers  When Agencies appearing at Estimates are unable to answer SenatorsÃ¢ÂÂ factual  questions in detail, the questions are Ã¢ÂÂtaken on NoticeÃ¢ÂÂ and agencies are required to  respond within 30 days.  At the May Estimates hearings the Department of Transport & Infrastructure took  185 questions on notice.  Not only were most of the answers returned more than three months after the 30 day  deadline, it has now been revealed that the responsible Minister, Anthony Albanese,  Ã¢ÂÂadjustedÃ¢ÂÂ 91 of the 185 supposedly Ã¢ÂÂfactualÃ¢ÂÂ answers supplied by the Department.



NBN signs up 5 households per day  More than 3½ years after NBNCo was established it has managed to sign up just  6,400 households to its fibre network.    ThatÃ¢ÂÂs less than five households per day since NBNCo was established on 9 April  2009 (1286 days ago).  Across all three NBNCo networks - fibre, wireless and satellite - 24,000 households  are connected.  But at least 9000 of these transferred from the Howard  GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Australian Broadband Guarantee program  Still, the customer service should be good. NBNCo has around one employee for  every 15 paying customers.



Cost of HSU investigation  Fair Work Australia (FWA) has so far spent more than $1.8 million on outside legal  and accounting advice for its investigation into the rorting of HSU funds   $1.3 million on external legal advice

$100,000 on external accounting advice   $430,000 on KPMGÃ¢ÂÂs review of the investigation  The $1.8 million does not include the cost to taxpayers of launching FWAÃ¢ÂÂs court  action against Labor MP, Craig Thomson.  The court action followed FWAÃ¢ÂÂs findings that Mr Thomson had used HSU funds to  pay for escort services and other improper purposes.



Transparency & ‘open government’?  The Department of Industry spent $156,348.36 in just 25 days trying to prevent The  Australian Financial Review from publishing details of Government subsidies to the  auto industry.







Application for $20m grant still ‘missing’  The May Budget provided a $20 million grant for MelbourneÃ¢ÂÂs World Heritage listed  Royal Exhibition Building.  But as far as officialdom can tell, no-one ever applied for the grant - it was just, er,  granted.  Not only that, but it seems no supporting documentation for the grant was provided  either.  Those in the know suspect it was simply a $20 million pay off to Greens MP, Adam  Bandt, whose seat includes the Exhibition Building and on whose vote the  Government depends for its survival.

CSIRO mismanagement  After a year of denials CSIRO has finally fessed up to failing to follow proper  workplace policies and procedures, including:   At least 14 cases of  providing incorrect information to Senate Estimates

Providing conflicting and inaccurate responses to questions on workplace  bullying,   Failing to correct Hansard regarding many of these matters,   Failing to fulfil their obligations under the Fair Work Act to at least 38 of their

employees.



Top bureaucrats fail to turn up to Estimates  The dates for this round of Senate Estimates hearings have been available since the  end of last year (2011).  Therefore it is Ã¢ÂÂdisappointingÃ¢ÂÂ that four of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs top bureaucrats have not  attended.

Dr Martin Parkinson, Treasury Secretary   Mr Michael DÃ¢ÂÂAscenzo, Commissioner of Taxation   Prof Ian Chubb, Chief Scientist   Mr Rob Nicholl, CEO of the Australian Office of Financial Management - the

agency that manages the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs debt - who gave only 12 hours notice  that he would not be available for questioning.



The real hit is on the taxpayer  Another Government agency has played the productivity card in a bid to defend its  spending on top-of-the-line coffee machines.  The Department of Industry admitted to buying five $15,000 Melitta coffee machines,  a total cost of $75,000.  This follows revelations that the Clean Energy Regulator purchased eight Nespresso  coffee machines at a cost of $20,175, one for each of its eight staff kitchens.  In each case the bureaucrats claimed it was better for staff to get their caffeine hits  in-house rather than walk across the road to the local (private sector) coffee shop.

The BER - a Textbook on Mismanagement  Questioning at Senate Estimates has revealed that 87 projects under the Building  the Education Revolution Ã¢ÂÂschool hallsÃ¢ÂÂ program are still not completed.  The BER was originally announced in February 2009 as part of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  response to the Global Financial crisis.  Eighteen months later (August 2010) a  review recommended that projects not yet started be rolled back into existing state  building programs.  The BER became a byword for waste and mismanagement.  It was widely rorted and  condemned by many school communities for not delivering the projects they really  needed, such as better school toilets.



Shambolic Centenary of ANZAC planning  The Coalition is committed to maintaining its bipartisan support for the Centenary of  ANZAC commemorations but that wonÃ¢ÂÂt stop it from highlighting poor management.  The Government plans to spend $350,000 on 39 public Ã¢ÂÂconsultation forumsÃ¢ÂÂ.  The first forum held in Sydney last week and $15,700.  Only six days notice was  given so itÃ¢ÂÂs not surprising only 15 people turned up.  Three of the 15 were paid  departmental officials and another two were paid consultants.



Security Council bid lacked clear strategy  Under Coalition questioning in the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee it became  clear that the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs bid for a temporary seat on the UN Security Council  lacked a strategic approach.  Rather than targeting swing votes in the 193 member  states, DFAT launched “a global campaign … in all regions of the world”.  Meanwhile, Senator Conroy, standing in for Foreign Minister Bob Carr who was  overseas, shut down questions on the cost of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Security Council  campaign.

Ambassadorial Caesar’s Palace  Taxpayers are paying more than $300,000 a year to rent a palatial apartment for the  Australian Ambassador to Rome whilst the official residence undergoes repairs.  Taxpayers are being slugged $30,000 a month for the apartment in a 3 year deal  which will ultimately cost taxpayers more than $1,000,000.

Labor’s Computers in Schools Fail   Just 10 out of more than 2,650 secondary schools have been connected to high  speed fibre despite Labor promising to do so more than five years ago, so much for  LaborÃ¢ÂÂs so-called “digital revolution”.











Grants Frozen in Budget’s Dash for Cash  Questioning at Senate Estimates has revealed the extent to which the Government  has put on hold grants which it had hitherto been keen to claim credit for   In the Industry portfolio, grants to Clean Technology Investment Programs have

been frozen indefinitely, leaving 260 Aus-Industry staff in limbo   $2 billion worth of grants to regional Australia have been frozen, including the  Regional Development Australia Fund that was promised in return for the support

of the Independents for Labor to form Government   Funding for small business support programs has been frozen, including money  promised to Business Enterprise centres   The Government has refused to guarantee the future of research and university

infrastructure grants worth nearly $1 billion.  It has also refused to guarantee that  uncommitted research grants wonÃ¢ÂÂt be clawed back, putting at risk hundreds of  jobs.



The school funding reforms are now in the hands of a 29-member joint Prime  Minister and Cabinet and Education Department taskforce, sidelining Education  Minister, Peter Garrett   The new school funding model has not yet been finalised. So far only some policy

settings have been prepared   Consequently, the Government has not yet begun formal negotiations with the  States regarding the new model even though the current model expires next year   With only eight House of Reps sitting days left for the year, the Australian

Education Act - which the PM called the most important Act of 2012 - has not yet  been drafted.



Carbon Tax attacks Army  The Carbon Tax is expected to cost the Army $20.3 million in increased energy  costs.

Labor Gets an ‘F” on Trade Training Centres   Five years since Labor promised a Trade Training Centre in every Australian high  school itÃ¢ÂÂs been revealed that 92% of schools are still waiting. Half way through  LaborÃ¢ÂÂs much vaunted 10 year project, theyÃ¢ÂÂve spent half the money allocated and  completed just 8%.

Researchers Pay the Price for Labor’s Mismanagement  Hundreds of projects and thousands of jobs are potentially at risk after LaborÃ¢ÂÂs  refusal to guarantee the future of research and university infrastructure grants worth  nearly a billion dollars.  Faced with a $120 billion black hole, Labor is slashing and burning in an attempt to  scrape together a budget surplus.

In brief

The Future Fund, which has around 80 full-time staff, spent $78,284 on taxis in  the ten months to April 2012.

The Department of Broadband has been sending Ã¢ÂÂmeticulously researchedÃ¢ÂÂ  articles extolling the benefits of the NBN to 22 Ã¢ÂÂNBN championsÃ¢ÂÂ suggesting they  try to get them published them under their own names.

Australia Post spent $280,000 on airfares and accommodation for the CEO and  ten staff to attend the London Olympics.

Delaying the completion of the Pacific Highway duplication from 2016 to 2020  would add at least $800 million to the cost of the project.
