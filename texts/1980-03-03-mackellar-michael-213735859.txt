INTERIM REPORT OF AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL  OBSERVER GROUP

The 1980 Rhodesian elections took place in a  society recently ravaged by civil war and which did not  have as a result of the war a political community sharing  an agreed set of rules to resolve political disputes  peacefully. In these circumstances to have attempted

to hold elections at all was ambitious . To have used them  to end a civil war was unique. The Group was of the  view that unless these facts were recognised then no  reasonable assessment could be made as to whether the

elections were free and fairÂ»

In making its judgment the Group applied a set of  criteria covering the principles and administration of  democratic elections and the conduct of campaigns . The  Group recognised that freedom and fairness in elections are  not absolutes but are gradations on a scale. The judgment  which the Group had to make was whether,  given the circumstances,

an acceptable level of freedom and fairness was achieved.

The principles underlying the electoral system  in Rhodesia on which the elections took place were those  which apply throughout the democratic world. The adult  franchise was broad and generous. The drawing of constituency  boundaries ensured the equality of votes and allocation of  ,seats to parties fair and consistent in terms of their votes.

The Group noted a minor qualification on the franchise. It  believed that more refugees could have been enabled to return  for the poll although it acknowledged that the numbers were  unlikely to have been electorally significant.

The Group draws attention to the provisions for white  representation and the related coalition provisions 6f Section  69(2) of the Constitution. While acknowledging that these  provisions were approved by all the participants at Lancaster

House the Group notes that in certain circumstances these  could be used in such a way as to qualify "genuine majority  rule".

The administrative arrangements for the elections  were the equal of those in any democratic society. In difficult  circumstances they assured impartiality and were extraordinarily  efficient. Stringent measures were undertaken to ensure

the secrecy of the vote and these were widely advertised  and understood. The Group was satisfied that the Rhodesian  electors had a secret vote. Problems arising from the  lack of a voters'  roll were circumvented and adequate

procedures were adopted to verify eligibility and avoid dual  voting. Procedures relating to candidate nomination and party

2Â»

registration were applied consistently and the provision  of polling places was adequate = .

It was in the context of its consideration of the  conduct of the election campaign that the Group encountered  most difficulty in assessing the freedom and fairness of  the elections Â» There had been widespread allegations of

serious limitations on the freedom of movement,  assembly  and expression,  of the partisan use of the forces of law  and order,  and most importantly of extensive, intimidation .   of voters by the major partiesÂ»

It is the Group's judgment that security, constraints  did impose some limitations on the freedom of movement , and that there were some inhibitions on freedom of assembly,  particularly in the rural areasÂ» Despite some media bias

there was relatively little constraint on freedom of  expressiono

It is also the Group's judgment that given the sudden  transformation of the struggle for power from the military  to the electoral sphere a considerable degree of impartiality  was achieved in the administration of law and orderÂ» Nevertheless,  this impartiality was marred because of

imperfections in the ceasefireÂ»

On the major contentious issue of intimidation  the Group concluded that there was a considerable degree of  intimidatory behaviour during the campaignÂ» Greatly perturbed  as the Group was about the more violent and heavy-handed

aspects of intimidation it did not believe that these negated  the overwhelmingly more positive aspects of the election,   the ultimate guarantee of which was the very widely acknowledged  secrecy of the voteÂ» The fact that some 2Ã¢ÂÂ7 million or 9306  per cent of the estimated electors voted over a three-day  period, in good order and good humour , without serious incident  was evidence of the universal desire to participate in

electing a government of the people's choiceÂ» Furthermore,   the Group.was conscious of the fact that with all the information  available to him, the Governor did not consider it necessary,   except in a minor w a y ,  to invoke his wide powers to discipline  parties and candidates for intimidatory practicesÂ»

It cannot be denied that there were flaws in the  conduct of the election campaign.Â» Nevertheless, the Group  believes that these imperfections were not sufficient to  compromise the freedom and fairness of the elections nor to

justify any serious questioning of the election result-Although some political parties claimed that the  elections were not free and fair the fact is that all parties  remained in the race,  mounted vigorous election campaigns,   with all. of the features normally seen in a democratic election

and openly solicited the votes of the people,  so successfully  that they achieved a turnout on a voluntary basis virtually  without parallel.Â»

The Group noted earlier that freedom and fairness  in elections are not absolutes but -are gradations on a scaleÂ»  It is the Group's considered judgment that in all the  circumstances the 1980 Rhodesian elections achieved a  sufficiently high level on this scale to be described

as free and fairÂ»

The Group believed that it is in the overwhelming  interest of all Rhodesians to accept the verdict of the  elections =

In conclusion the Group wishes to acknowledge  with thanks the considerable assistance afforded to it by  the British and Rhodesian authorities in the performance  of its task=

The Group also wishes to pay tribute to the  Australian servicemen::who formed part of the Commonwealth  Monitoring Force which carried out a difficult and demanding  job with great distinctions
