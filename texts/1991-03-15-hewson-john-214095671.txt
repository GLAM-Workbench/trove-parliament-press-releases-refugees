There are many reasons why I am delighted to be with you  today to launch this important publication.

In a personal sense, I am very proud to be associated with  a work which chronicles not only the achievements of the  Australian Jewish community since 1788, but also the  difficulties it has faced and its changing role in the  wider Australian society

- this book is much more than a narrow immigrant history

- it is the story of how a religious and ethnic group of

considerable diversity has galvanised itself to make  a disproportionately rich contribution to our national  development

- it is a story of how integration has stopped short of

assimilation

- it is a story set firmly in the wider context of

Australia's history, and

- as such, The Jews in Austya^ift will have an appeal

that extends far beyond the members of the Australian  Jewish community; it will be of enduring interest to  all who seek an answer to the question of why

Australia has become the kind of country it is.

In a professional sense, I feel honoured to be associated  with a work of such high scholarship and such meticulous  care

- Professor Rubinstein and Dr Rubinstein have produced  a work that is impressive in its scale, measured in  its judgements and original in its argument

- the presentation of a thematic history is always a

more difficult task than a chronological one; but, as  The Jews in Australia shows, when it is done

effectively, the thematic approach is a more

stimulating and rewarding experience for writers and  readers alike

In a political sense, I am delighted to be performing this  task as Leader of the Liberal Party. We are a Party which  has always been a firm friend of Israel and the Australian  Jewish community; and we are looking to strengthen those

ties even more in the years ahead.

I must admit that, in addition to the personal and

professional reasons for my pleasure in being with you  today, there is also a more self-interested consideration  involved t '

- my electorate of Wentworth in Sydney has one of the

highest percentages of Jewish constituents of any  electorate in Australia

- I hope that some of the historical detail I have

managed to pick up from the labours of Dr and

Professor Rubinstein will pleasantly surprise my  constituentsl

Dr and Professor Rubinstein have produced a history that  will appeal to specialists and general readers alike.

I fall into the category of a general reader with regard to  such historical works. And there are a number of

attributes of this particular history that convince me of  its importance and wide appeal.

First, and above all, it is a work of the highest

historical standard

- It is not a history which is selective or determined

to present Australian Jewry in the best light possible

- the authors are, of course, sympathetic to the Jewish  cause but they are not apologists for it

- each of their judgements is scrupulously supported by  the evidence they produce

- they call the shots as they see them

- this is particularly the case in their treatment of

the origins of Australian anti-semitism and in their  analysis of the haphazardness of Jewish life in

Australia prior to 1945

Second, The Jews in Australia is an important book because  it presents an immigrant history that is, in many ways, the  reverse of what happened to many other ethnic groups in  Australia

- the history, for example, of one of the strongest of

sub-cultures in Australia, the Irish sub-culture, was  marked by its vitality in the nineteenth century and  its withering away after the 1930's

- we also know that, with many other ethnic groups in

Australia, the passing of the generations tends to  diminish some of .  the strength of their shared

loyalties to the culture and homelands of their  parents and grandparents

But Professor and Dr Rubinstein present a very different  history of the Australian Jewish community

they chronicle the dramatic transformation of the  Jewish community during and after the 1930's. A

community which was religiously apathetic, which  tended to deny its Jewish distinctiveness and which  cautiously accepted Zionism only to the extent that it  did not conflict with official British policy

subsequently transformed itself into a community that  was very much inward-looking, cohesive, concerned with  its own future and with Jewish issues, very sensitive  and responsive to anti-semitism, and absolutely

supportive of Israel

the causes of this dramatic transformation make fascinating reading

: one obvious cause was the dramatic post-war

increase in the size of the Australian Jewish  community

- but there were many other factors involved

: there was, of course, the impact of the

Holocaust, the creation of the State of Israel,  and the heightened sense of 'Jewish peoplehood'

i there was the emergence of elected leaders for

Australian Jewry who were secular rather than  religious

$ there was the growth in the strength of Zionism

i there was the development of a greater sense of Jewishness, particularly as a result of the

development of the day schools

: and there was the increased preparedness of

Australian Jews to respond to displays or

suggestions of anti-semitism

I  *

All these developments in Australian Jewry since the  1930|s are carefully analysed by Professor Rubinstein. In  my view, they provide an exception to the general rule as  far as the history of Australian minorities is concerned!  with the passing of time, Australian Jewry became more  cohesive, not less so; it became more religious, not less

so; and it became more ’Jewish' than it had ever been

before.

A third attribute of The Jews In Australia is its human  dimension. Coming from a political party which places a  premium on individual incentives and the pursuit of

excellence, I found the chapters on "Jewish Achievement and  Achievers" particularly stimulating reading

Dr Rubinstein quotes the Jewish saying that "the Jews are  like other people, only more so". That comment is a

particularly appropriate one as the scale of the

contributions to Australian life by members of the Jewish  community become apparent

The deeds of the most well-known and highly respected  members of the Jewish community are, of course, carefully  noted. The extraordinary careers of people like Sir Isaac  Isaacs, Sir John Monash, Sir Zelman Cowen and Sidney Myer

are detailed. I am delighted to see that Sir zelman is

with us today. Professor Rubinstein rightly describes Sir  zelman as "the most distinguished living Jew" and his  achievements are an inspiration to his fellow Jews and to  all Australians"

- I was particularly struck by a passage in Professor

Rubinstein's volume which recounted a question which  Sir Zelman was asked on his appointment as Governor  General. Sir Zelman was askd how it felt being a Jew.  He simply said: "I have never been anything else".

But it is the breadth of the Jewish contribution to

Australian life that comes through in these volumes.  Whether it be in Federal or State politics, or law, or the  public service, or business, or the military, or medicine,  or academia, the role of individual Australian Jews has  been outstanding

I was especially interested in the Jewish contribution to  Australian cultural life particularly by writers such as  Solomon Stedman, Pinches Goldhar, Judah Waten, David Martin  and Cyril Pearl; by artiste such as Emmanuel Fox, Yosl  Bergner and Sail Herman; and by musicians such as Isaac  Nathan, Richard Goldner and Isador Goodman. The

contribution by these and many other Australian Jews to  our national culture is a rich and enduring one

5

Fourthly, The Jews in Australia is a work which is notable  for its detailed and moving account of Jewish refugees in  the 1930's and 1940's .

- there is the description of the selfless and energetic  work of people such as Leo Fink and Saul Symonds in

aiding the refugees in Australia

- there are historical judgements made on the number of  Jewish refugees accepted by Australia which numbered  only 9,000 between 1933 and 1943

- there are new insights into the Kimberley Scheme,

which was finally rejected by Prime Minister Curtin in  July 1944, and into the story of the '  Dunera'

internees

The Jewish refugee saga is an important aspect of

Australia’s history and Professor and Dr Rubinstein tell  the story movingly and powerfully

A fifth quality of this book which helps to make it such a  stimulating historical work is its scale and breadth. It  is a history of Jewish life in Australia in all its

dimensions

- in its congregational life and religious observance

- in its communal groups

- in its Zionist commitment

- in its relations with the wider community

- and, very importantly, in its educational activity,  particularly the establishment of the Jewish day  schools which Professor Rubinstein rightly describes  as "the jewel in the crown of post-war Australian

Jewish life"

This breadth of vision makes The ?q w b  in Australia a

definitive contribution to the study of Australian Jewry  and one which will last the test of time

As Professor and Dr Rubinstein emphasise, one of the

characteristics of the Australian Jewish community in the  post-war period has been its absolute commitment to the  State of Israel

Over recent weeks, of course, Israel has, once again, been  a focus of world attention as Saddam Hussein tried in vain  to drag it into his destructive war which ended in such  ignominious defeat for him

6

Israel's restraint in the face of such provocation won it  great respect and played a significant role in the speed  and decisiveness of Saddam Hussein's defeat

Now, in the wake of -the Gulf war, the friends of Israel,  among which the Federal Opposition is proud to be numbered,  are closely monitoring the peace process

Last week in the Parliament, I outlined what I saw as

Australia's priorities in the rapidly evolving Middle East  situation. I said that Australia should examine ways to  support the peace process but that we should avoid

gratuitous advice

Among the priorities I emphasised, two were fundamental

- first, Israel's Arab neighbours, which have not

recognised Israel's right to exist in peace and within  secure boundaries, should do so

- and second, that process should be reciprocated by

Israel's preparedness to negotiate on the Palestinian  issue with neighbouring states and with moderate  representatives of the Palestinian people, which I  believe do not include the current leadership of the  PLO. The Opposition has taken a consistent stand that  we must judge the PLO by its deeds, not its words, and

that its deeds over recent years have not indicated a  seriousness about the peace process. We are pleased  that the Government has now finally come to share that  view with us.

I know that Professor and Dr Rubinstein are right about the  absolute strength of the Australian Jewish community's commitment to Israel. I know that the community will be  very closely watching developments in the Middle East over  coming months. And I look forward to consulting with its

leaders about the prospects for genuine peace in the region  and lasting security for Israel

Finally, may I end on a personal note. Professor

Rubinstein's conclusion is that, in the space of two postÂ­ war generations, Australian Jewry evolved from a "fringe  backwater in the Jewish world" to a status as one of the  larger and more important Jewish communities in the world.

That achievement is one in which by all Australian Jews can  take pride. It is also one that owes a great deal to the

quality of its leaders among whom many have been prominent  in the post-war years. But, as Professor Rubinstein says,  none have been more so that Maurice Ashkanasy and lei Liebler. It is right that the scale of their contribution has received its proper recognition

Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to launch this

history. It is a great credit not only to the skills of

7

the writers but to the professionalism of the publishers  William Heinemann Australia who have magnificently  presented the publication.

It is also a credit to the Australian Institute of Jewish  Affaire in Melbourne which has given such encouragement and  support to this project.

I congratulate all these associated with this work. I wish  it the success it richly deserves.
