GILBERT:  On another matter, the Shadow Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has arrived back  in Australia after his visit to Nauru and the announcement of their expanded Pacific  Solution.  Scott Morrison joins me now from the Sydney studio.  Mr Morrison, first of  all, your trip to Nauru was funded by Toll, the company that obviously specialises in  logistics, tents and so on.  The Government’s suggested a conflict of interest.  What  do you say to that?

MORRISON:  Well I reject it.  I mean, first of all, we’ve been very transparent about this, Kieran, it’s  on my Register of Interest.  The News Limited journalist who accompanied us  actually declared it in their story so we were very up front about all of this.  And it’s  not the first time obviously journalists have accompanied portfolio Shadow Ministers  or others or even the Leader of the Opposition on privately funded trips.   I mean  Fairfax have been on those trips before and I note that on other occasions they didn’t  feel the need to disclose that.  So there’s nothing terribly unusual about this, the  issue is about transparency and frankly, I’m quite happy to be transparent about  this.  If only Labor were more transparent about them going to ski lodges with Eddie  Obeid and not disclosing those arrangements but I understand that on that occasion,  Minister Burke said that he didn’t have to disclose his trip to the ski lodge of Eddie  Obeid because he was a friend of Eddie Obeid.  Well, I’ll let people make their own  judgement.

GILBERT:    Anthony Albanese says I know that the Coalition are strong advocates of  privatisation, but there’s got to be some limits to it and privatising out the visit by Mr  Morrison to develop policy for the Coalition, if that has occurred, that would be  extraordinary.

MORRISON:  Well that’s just a ridiculous suggestion from Mr Albanese, it’s fairly desperate I think

to try and deflect attention from what we all know is going to happen here in New  South Wales today.  I mean,  ICAC is bringing down findings on three notorious  characters, all part of the New South Wales Labor machine, that ran the State  Government here.  But I mean if they want to raise those issues, Kieran, and if you  want to raise them as well, well I think that’s the context in which I think this has to  be seen.

GILBERT:  Ok, I’m just getting your response to the suggestions that have been put out there,  you’ve given us your time this morning.  The enhanced Nauru solution, the Pacific  Solution Mark II, there’s been criticism as well, that it was policy on the run, that it  wasn’t run by the Shadow Cabinet.  Was this taken to Shadow Cabinet?

MORRISON:  There’s been offshore processing policy for the Coalition for a decade, this is our  policy, this has always been our policy, so there’s no change to that policy.  So this is  policy of the Opposition, it always has been.  That’s a ridiculous suggestion.  I don’t  think any Australian has any doubt that it is the policy of the Coalition to have  offshore processing.  We released last week the policy about expanding that  offshore processing capacity and I want to make very clear that it’s not just the  expanded capacity on Nauru, I mean that is an addition to what the government  claims they’re doing in Manus Island, which will have a limit, the PNG Prime Minister  says, of around 3000.  So in addition to that, we’ve also got the very much more  expanded capacity that we are planning to do on Nauru.  We have always said  offshore processing has to be a central part of any package.  Of itself it’s not the  answer but it needs to work with all the other measures that are necessary.

GILBERT:  What does the agreement amount to?  Julie Bishop yesterday, talking to David  Speers, said it wasn’t a formal agreement or a treaty with Nauru.

MORRISON:  Of course not.

GILBERT:  How would you characterise it though.  What is it?  A handshake deal or what?

MORRISON:

We’re in Opposition, Kieran, we’re not a government so we can’t form treaties or  agreements with anyone at this stage.  What we’ve had is very detailed discussions

about sites and places where immediate ramp up could be put in place for  accommodation of a temporary nature but also of a permanent nature and most  importantly for post assessment accommodation for those found to be refugees.  I  mean, this is a five year plan.  It’s not a five week talking point that the government  has from now to the election.

GILBERT:

But these are only conversations at this stage, there’s no deal done.

MORRISON:  Well how could there be a deal, Kieran, we’re the opposition?  All you can do in  opposition is lay out your plans and commence the discussions and gauge the level  of interest.  I spoke to all the members of Parliament yesterday, both opposition and  government and got a very warm reception.  Nauru is very committed to offshore  processing continuing there and we have a very, very good arrangement.  I’ve been  there four times Kieran, I know the people there very well and the current Minister  has been there for little more than four hours.  So I’m quite confident about our ability  to put in place our real plans with real commitments that we understand how they  can be implemented and we have the strong support of the Nauruans I think to get  on with that.

GILBERT:

There’s not a lot of detail though, no costings.  You’ve been critical of the  government for not having the detail, the costings relating to PNG and yet you’re  saying you’re going to do Nauru and PNG as well, it’s going to cost a lot and there’s  -

MORRISON:

Well I can tell you Kieran.

GILBERT:

-there wasn’t even a press release put out yesterday.

MORRISON:

Well there was a press release put out yesterday.  The indicative costings are  around about $50 million to get a 2000 man tented accommodation up on Nauru.   Now that’s obviously subject to working through operational details.  I’m puzzled why  the government can’t give you an indicative costing along those lines, Kieran, I mean  we’ve been pretty upfront.  We walked around the sites with the media that were with  us yesterday.  I’ve been there, I’ve taken media to the spots where it will happen.   This is actually a real plan, we’ve been very open and transparent about that.  The  government won’t tell you how much they’re building, what the cost is.  They don’t  even have a resettlement arrangement and let me make this point if I can, Kieran.   The test of the PNG arrangement is not whether people get sent to Manus Island, I  mean they’ve been running offshore processing for almost a year there.  They’ve  actually taken more people off Manus Island than they’ve sent there.  The test is not  whether they sent people there, the test is whether they have an agreement for  resettlement.

GILBERT:

So you’re saying it’s $50 million for the 2000 tent?

MORRISON:

The first initial ramp up, that’s the indicative costing for putting a facility like that in  place.

GILBERT:

What about the permanent five year plan?

MORRISON:

Well we have to work through the master planning arrangements for that and that  deals with the post assessment accommodation.

GILBERT:

So no numbers, no detail on that?

MORRISON:

On that, we have to do a master planning process Kieran.  That’s how you do those  things and they’re where you need the resources of government and that’s  something that would happen over 18 months to two years.  Now the initial phase  though of the permanent rebuild of the Canstruct accommodation that was burnt  down and also the family accommodation which still needs to be built, we’re almost a  year down from when they first said that they would put these facilities on Nauru  permanent for families and they still don’t exist.  Now they’re within the government’s  forward estimates and that’s what needs to happen.  See the difference here, Kieran,  is - we have a plan that deals - no, if I can finish my sentence Kieran -

GILBERT:

Mr Morrison let me just ask you though because the Coalition said that you’ll have  full costings out there before the election.  You’re now saying that this pivotal policy’s  going to take two years to get the costing.

MORRISON:

No I’m not saying that, Kieran.  What we have said-

GILBERT:

You just said it’s a two year plan -

MORRISON:

Kieran if you’d like to listen to my answer.  What I’m saying is we’ve got the initial  ramp up capacity of 2000 for which we have an indicative costing of around $50  million.  To actually go and put in place the permanent accommodation for post  assessment which would start to be ramped up after about 12 to 18 months, after  you’ve gone through a thorough master planning process - well that would go  through a proper costed and assessment package at that time.  So I don’t think  there’s anything unusual about it, you would expect that to be done properly in  consultation with the local community and be able to put those things in place with all  the appropriate advice.  Now that’s what I’m saying we’re doing.  We’ve set out a  very clear vision for how we were going to manage this over the next five years.   Temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation, post assessment  accommodation and a clear commitment for five years up in Nauru to ensure we  have a real plan for offshore processing.  The government can’t tell you what they’re  doing in the next five weeks, Kieran, so I’m always interested that there’s always a

lot more scrutiny of what the Coalition puts forward and the government has  announced something on two pages, has no detail, has no costings and they won’t  even tell you how many people are going to go there.

GILBERT:

Don’t worry, there will be scrutiny of that as well.

MORRISON:

I look forward to that.

GILBERT:

The economic statement due on Friday, there’ll be a lot of scrutiny on that.  We’ve  also got Jason Clare coming up at 8.30 so that was a good plug for AM agenda as  well.  Thanks Scott Morrison for your time, appreciate it.

MORRISON:

Thanks Kieran, good to be with you as always.
