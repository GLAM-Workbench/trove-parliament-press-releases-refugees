MEDIA RELEASE



APPOINTMENTS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL

Today I announce the appointment of the Hon Justice David Thomas as President of the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). Justice Thomas has also been appointed as a judge  of the Federal Court.

Justice Thomas’ experience and qualifications make him the right person to lead Australia’s  merits review tribunal. His appointment is for seven years.

Justice Thomas has been a member of the Supreme Court of Queensland and President of the  Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) since 2013.

Justice Thomas is President of the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of  Queensland and Deputy Chair of the Queensland Ballet.

Other appointments  I also announce a number of appointments and re-appointments to the AAT. These  appointees are highly qualified to undertake the important task of conducting merits review  of government decisions.

All of the appointments are for seven years. A majority of the appointees are existing  members of the Tribunal.

On behalf of the Government, I congratulate the appointees and look forward to the  contribution they will make to the AAT.
