ARRANGEMENTS FOR VOLUNTARY RETURN

OF EAST TIMORESE

Â

Arrangements for the voluntary return of East Timorese from  
Australia to Dili were announced today by Senator Amanda Vanstone, Minister 
for Justice and Customs and Acting Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs.

Â

“A series of flights back to Dili start today from 
Darwin for East Timorese in Australia who have volunteered to return,” 
Senator Vanstone said. “Fifty East Timorese are on today’s flight.”

Â

“Senator Vanstone said the return arrangements followed 
assurances by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
that it was safe for the East Timorese to return. The United Nations 
has reported that some 40 000 have now returned to their country.

Â

“We were also guided by the success of the initial 
return flight last Thursday when 40 East Timorese evacuees returned 
to Dili where they were met by representatives of the UNHCR and international 
aid agencies.

Â

“From tomorrow, there will be two flights each afternoon 
from Darwin. The East Timorese will travel by commercial flights in 
the morning to join the afternoon flights,” the Minister said.

Â

“We have been working with LVNHCR and the International 
Organization for Migration (LOM) to arrange these flights. The United 
States of America has kindly made available military C-i 30 Hercules 
aircraft, fitted out with seats, to provide the shuttle service. Each 
flight is able to take up to 50 passengers.”

Â

The Minister emphasised that all those returning were 
volunteers, and the UNHCR was verifying the voluntary nature of the 
decision to return by each family before they depart.

Â

“There is absolutely no question that people are 
being forced to return. Only volunteers are scheduled for return flights.
