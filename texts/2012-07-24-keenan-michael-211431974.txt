Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling BOAT ARRIVALS AVERAGE OVER 1,600  PER MONTH SINCE BUDGET July 24, 2012

The arrival of yet another illegal boat, this time carrying 160 people, means more than 4,100 people have turned up on 59 boats since Labor handed down their budget in May, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

"Labor’s budget assumed 450 arrivals on illegal boats per month. Since that budget arrivals have averaged at over 1,600 per month, meaning further blowouts on Labor’s $1.1 billion a year asylum budget are inevitable," Mr Morrison said.

"Labor’s decision to abolish the Howard Government’s proven measures at the urging of the Greens and other advocates has led to the cost, chaos and tragedy that we see on our borders today.

"Labor is in a deadlock of their own making and can act today to restore the proven policies they abolished. Instead, the committees continue to convene, resolving only to meet again and take further advice.

"This is all music to the people smugglers’ ears who know that as long as Labor remains in Government, their business model is secure.

"The  Coalition  does  not  need  a  committee  to  understand  what  needs  to  be  done  to  restore  control  to  our  borders  and integrity to our refugee and humanitarian programme.

"The Coalition will stop the committees and restore the policies that stopped the boats.

"That is why the only thing the people smugglers fear is the election of a Coalition Government," Mr Morrison said.

Mr Keenan said: "In the last 24 hours we have seen another three illegal boats arrive, carrying 319 people.

"Not only do you have Labor’s monthly budget of 450 arrivals blown in a single week but there has been more than four times the amount of boats arrive in July than in the same time last year.

"These record numbers are only increasing at an uncontrollable rate Ã¢ÂÂ placing immense strain on the resources of both  our Border Protection Command and the detention network.

"When is this Government going to offer the Australian people anything other than excuses and growing debt," Mr Keenan  said.
