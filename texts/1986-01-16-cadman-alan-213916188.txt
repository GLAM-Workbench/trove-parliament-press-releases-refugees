AUSTRALIA - SOFT ON DRUGS

Singapore and Malaysia think Australia is "soft" on drugs,  and resent Australian criticism of their legal system.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  The Federal Opposition Task Force on Refugees and Drugs was  told in Singapore yesterday, 15 January 1986,'by Singaporean  and Australian officials, that the criticism of legal competence,  the judicial system, and strong drug laws, by Australians,

indicate that Australia is not prepared to take strong steps  in the fight against drugs. ,  -

The Task Force comprises Federal Members of Parliament . Tim Fischer, John Sharp, .and Alan Cadman. Two of the Team  are from the Opposition's front bench.

"Continual criticism from Australia is regarded as impertinent  intervention in the private affairs of these two countries,   which reflect Australia's lack of commitment to dealing with  drug traffickers. Ã¢ÂÂ

"It was put to us that the harsh-penalties for trading in .   drugs in Singapore and Malaysia are designed to discourage  traffickers from hooking children and young people into  this obnoxious trade."

Team Leader Alan Cadman, said that traditional respect for . the laws of other countries in our neighbourhood should remain  a feature of relationships.

"These countries are deadly serious in their efforts against .   the drug trade, and I would not want to see declining of  co-operation with Australia, in law enforcement and intelligence  "on drug traders." :
