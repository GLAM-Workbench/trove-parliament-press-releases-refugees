ABC 612 Mornings with Madonna King  1 December 2010





E&OE



Subjects:  Immigration, multiculturalism, 2011 Parliament

KING: Just looking at multiculturalism and the impact on our city and how  it's changed our suburbs - from the restaurants we frequent to the  fashion we wear to the music we listen to. And then we're going to  go to the politicians.

Each Wednesday we go Inside Canberra and this morning Steven  Ciobo, the MP for Moncrieff, standing in for Senator George  Brandis. Good morning.

CIOBO: Good morning, Madonna.

KING: And Dr Craig Emerson, MP for Rankin and the Trade Minister in  Julia Gillard's Government. Good morning.

EMERSON: Hello to you, Madonna and to you, Steve.

CIOBO: Good morning.

KING: And if you have a question from the audience, I haven't put this to  you - I was going to say blokes - gentlemen, but if there is a  question in the audience you don't mind answering it this morning?

EMERSON: I'll certainly try.



CIOBO: Likewise Madonna, I'll be very happy to.

KING: All right. Well let's just start because you can't have a discussion  about multiculturalism without having a discussion about  immigration and immigration levels. And given the theme of today,  can I ask you both, do you think some of these wonderful people  might not have made it to our shores under the policies both parties  are talking about now?

EMERSON: Gee, that's a very hard one to answer at the outset. I think that over  the period of the previous government, the boast was that they  stopped the boats. The perspective that I'd like to bring on that  Madonna is that even over that period and in par … and indeed  over 35 years, the total number of people who arrived in Australia  by boat was about 25,000, which would be a fairly modest crowd at  a rugby or rugby union semi-final match.

So the idea that there's this armada or invasion is wrong. But I think  that, of course, this is a country that has been built on immigration. I  suspect that we'd have a population around maybe 10 million  people, just at a guess, if we had no immigrants. And in fact, if we  had no immigrants, we wouldn't have anyone here beyond the first  Australians, the Indigenous people.

KING: That's very interesting to say that the ... the estimate of our  population, what is it? About 20 million now?

EMERSON: Twenty-two million now.

KING: Twenty-two million and without immigration it would be something  like 10 million?

EMERSON: Yeah. Look, don't hold me to the number but it would be much,  much smaller than it is now.

KING: All right Steven Ciobo, can I just go a step further with that question  and ask you, is there a bit of an anti-immigrant feeling in the  community do you think?

CIOBO: Well I think that it's varied - like anything, Madonna. You know,  there's no doubt that in some respects there's elements of the  community that do have those feelings. But I've got to say I'm not  actually detecting it as an anti-immigrant feeling. As someone with a  surname like I do, with Ciobo, it's not exactly you know, a traditional  English name. You sort of meet a wide cross section of people and  of course from time to time you tap on elements that I would  consider to be a little ugly in terms of their attitudes. But…



KING: Is that what we're seeing though now? A bit of a populist…

CIOBO: Well no. What I actually think is going on is what I would summarise  as being a discussion about values and I think that it's really those  values that underscores a lot of the angst that some elements of the  community have because there's no doubt that there are a number  of Australians who say, ‘look we have specific Australian values and  we would like our immigrants - that is people who choose to come  to Australia - to share the values that we have’.

KING: Is that a fair point Craig Emerson?

EMERSON: It is but it's always been so. I grew up in a small country town and it  was not unusual that in our town, Baradine, the cafÃÂ© was run by  Pop Pantis. He was Greek. And Steve Anna ran the other cafÃÂ©. So  they were both Greek and that was very, very common. There was  a wave of post-war immigration including to country areas from the  Mediterranean countries, Greek and Italian.

KING: Oh and if you…

EMERSON: And down comes the rain.

KING: And can you just get…

EMERSON: Subsequently Madonna, people started arriving from Turkey, the  Middle East, then Malcolm Fraser's period a lot of people did arrive  from Vietnam after the Vietnam War and each time it has created  the same debate that Steve has talked about. And he's right where  people say, ‘hold on, but we're Australian, we want you to embrace  Australian values’.

KING: All right, I want to ... I want to ask you, what does being Australian  mean? But if you can hear that beautiful rain in the background, it's  just started to pour down. Can everyone here still hear us clearly?  And I guess there's nothing more Brisbane or Queensland than that  beautiful sound of rain on a rooftop is there?

EMERSON: No, and apparently it's the wettest spring on record. So it's all very  welcome. The dams are overtopping and the grass is green and  we're pretty happy about that.

CIOBO: Madonna, I was originally concerned because when Craig started  speaking everyone in the front row got up and started walking  away. And I thought, ‘gee you've turned the crowd off very quickly  Craig’. But it's just the rain. So that's…

EMERSON: They got washed away.



KING: We're going to come back to what being Australian means in just a  moment. But when someone arrives on our shores, Steve Ciobo is  talking about values, to both of you, what are the values that you  want to see in someone who wants to call Australia home?

EMERSON: I do think that it's legitimate for people who are already here  regardless of where they've come from to expect those who arrive  to call themselves Australian. And in fact, if you like, not bring the  troubles that they may have experienced internally in other  countries to our country.

KING: You mean the conflicts?

EMERSON: The conflicts. And look, I know that they can be agonising for  people but I think it's fair enough for Australians to say, ‘well you've  now made Australia your home’. I am very, very strong on  Australian citizenship. I think we should encourage people to  become citizens in this country, not make it hard for them to  become citizens in the country because that is a pledge of  allegiance to this country.

CIOBO: And Madonna, I would add two additional points which is that I think  that the commitment that I'd be looking for, and I believe that many  of my colleagues would be looking for, is a commitment to secular  government. A belief that, you know, here in Australia we have  government that sits aside and separately to the church. Whatever  your religion might be, I think that's got to be an underpinning of  Australian values. And in addition to that, a commitment to  democracy and to equality before the law - and that applies, you  know, irrespective of gender, irrespective of a number of different  approaches that other countries may have internationally.

KING: That's the voice of Steven Ciobo with Dr Craig Emerson here this  morning as we go Inside Canberra at Cascade Court at QPAC. And  if you want to look at the different foods, the costumes that are on  display here, you can just go to our Facebook page at 612 ABC  Brisbane. Just before we move onto multiculturalism, Steve Ciobo,  the Opposition keeps counting boats. Should there be more  emphasis - and I'll ask both of you this - on people overstaying  their visas, people arriving by plane than asylum seekers arriving by  boat?

CIOBO: You Madonna, I think this is a very interesting public policy  discussion. And the reason I say it's interesting is because what is  not the smallest but one of the smaller categories of immigrants into  Australia is of course those that come, what we would say illegally,  that is they don't have a visa to come into Australia and obviously  the focus of that is on boats.  Can I say as a Liberal and as



someone who supports our policies in this area, often they  characterise us as lacking compassion. I'm often characterised as  lacking compassion. Can I say to you truthfully that that is not what  this is about for me. I truly believe that if we allow that system to  flourish, if we allow people to pay people smugglers and achieve a  migration outcome, that actually is less compassionate in my view.  Because those people that are sitting in refugee camps and  humanitarian camps who are applying to get access to Australia  through the UNHCR program, they're effectively denied the  opportunity to take a space because a lot of these places are going  to those who have paid people smugglers. So for me, as much as it  is often characterised in glib media comments and characterised in  sort of 10 second grabs on TV or radio about lacking compassion  because of our policies, I honestly believe that our policies are more  about a level playing field. More about equality for those who can't  afford to pay than it is anything else.

EMERSON: And just when you thought Labor and Liberal wouldn't agree on  anything in relation to asylum seekers, I agree. The ... we shouldn't  be down on asylum seekers for seeking a better life in Australia or  in any other country. We should be down on people smugglers  because people smugglers make money out of it. They also put at  risk those very same asylum seekers and there's been a number of  terribly tragic accidents on the seas where men, women and  children have perished and so I agree with Steve..It's to attack the  incentives for people smuggling and if we could get to an  agreement on how best to do that a lot of the divisiveness would go  out of the debate. But I also agree with Steve. I do assert that on  occasions some Liberals do go too far in talking about ‘they're here’  and you know, as kind of an inference that they're bad people.

KING: Some of your own do that too.

EMERSON: I don't know that our people do. But anyway, whether that's right or  wrong, certainly sections of the media do create this fear that there  is this some sort swarthy influence permeating Australia and Tony  Abbott has talked about an invasion, or at least an armada of boats.  Now I agree that we should do what we can to cut down and  abolish these incentives for people smuggling but let's not blame  people for seeking a better life in this country or any other country.

KING: It's 17 minutes to 10 here on 612 ABC Brisbane. Can I ask you both  what the word ‘multiculturalism’ means? When you hear that word  what's its definition?

CIOBO: Well I mean I interpret multiculturalism as being a plurality of  cultures obviously. And I think that's also one of the reasons why



that historically has been slightly controversial because there is the  view that Australia has one culture among some. Look, Australia's  culture is fairly hybrid. You know, it's a blend of sort of ... obviously  our English and Irish ancestry. It's a blend of Indigenous culture. It's  a blend of those that came with the wave of migration following the  Second World War from parts of Europe, the Italians, the Greeks  and so on and so forth.

KING: And so do you agree with that definition pretty much?

EMERSON: No, not exactly. I was a staffer for Bob Hawke and I don't know if  that term was originally phrased during the period of the Hawke  Government but I know exactly what it meant at that time, and it  was that when people come to Australia they should embrace  Australia values but they are not expected to completely repudiate  their own cultures. So there could be multiple cultures but a  commitment to Australia. And that is…

KING: So we're not one big melting pot?

EMERSON: Well no, it's different from the notion of assimilation which is more  like abandon your traditions, abandon your dress, abandon  everything that you grew up with as a migrant and become an  Aussie and eat fish and chips. That's not what multiculturalism is  meant to be.

KING: So how far do you think migrants should go, and how much is the  onus on them to assimilate?

EMERSON: Look, I think there's a generational issue here and if we understood  this better I think the level of tolerance would be greater. It's very  difficult for example with the people who came from Vietnam by  boat, to immediately spread out right across Australia, right through  a city, when they didn't speak English, when they were scared,  when it was a new country. Of course the first generation of  Vietnamese people would move to suburbs where they saw each  other and could contact each other by foot. The second and third  generations then start moving out.  And if we understood that that is  not unusual and it has been the pattern of migrant settlement in  Australia for many years - that it's a generational thing and you  can't expect people to lob into a place and spread out and not see  their fellow countrymen and women.

KING: In just a moment ... what does that mean though, in terms of  assimilation? Does it mean speaking English? What does it mean in  terms of dress? That's what we'll do next here on 612 ABC  Brisbane. I'm with Steven Ciobo and Dr Craig Emerson. My name is  Madonna King and you're on 612 ABC Brisbane.



KING: It's now 14 minutes to 10 and thanks for your company this  morning. We're Inside Canberra here at Cascade Court at QPAC  this morning. My guests - Dr Craig Emerson and Steven Ciobo -  and we're talking about assimilation and what onus is on migrants  to assimilate into our community. And very briefly Craig Emerson,  what do you think a migrant needs to do to be accepted as part of  Australia?

EMERSON: Learning English as quickly as possible is a huge asset. And can I  say Madonna, that the younger migrants who come to Australia and  certainly to Logan City, the first thing they want to do is learn  English because they want to get a job.

KING: Steven Ciobo, do you think they should be required to learn  English?

CIOBO: I think what people are looking for is a commitment, Madonna. I  mean, to pick up on the points that Craig made earlier, like anything  it's a two-way street. You know, the concerns that people have in  the community need to be heard and in the same way the genuine  challenges that migrants face need to be heard as well.

KING: And would the genuine concern in the street is that people…

CIOBO: Well it's a little like - sorry, not to cut you off, but it's a little like Craig  made the comment before, and I think you're being fiercely partisan  Craig, but he made the comment about, you know, some Liberals  go overboard. Well, look, on that side of the coin, perhaps some do.  But on the flip side of that coin, there's also those that I think put  such a ... what I would phrase as political correctness to concerns  that people raise, that it almost requires a pressure valve to release  the built up. And I think you've seen some of that occur in Australia  in the past, and that's where I say it's really a two-way street. You  need both…

EMERSON: I agree with that.

CIOBO: ...an open dialogue, where people can feel they can raise concerns,  have them heard, and have them discussed. So when it comes to  English, for example, I think that what Australians want is not for  people to speak perfect English, not even necessarily that they  have to speak English when they come to Australia, but a  commitment to trying to learn our national language.

KING: What about clothing then, when you talk about that kind of  understanding tolerance in the community? We've seen this as a  debate. It's been a debate in Europe, it's been a debate across the  world.



CIOBO: Well, you go into the Valley on a Friday night and you'll see a wide  range of clothing down there.

KING: At the other end of the spectrum.

CIOBO: So, you know, I, for me ... look, personally, for me, that's less of a  concern. I mean obviously there's questions there about, my guess,  what you're going to are some of the controversial aspects like the  burqa.

KING: Yeah, the burqa and the hijab.

CIOBO: Sure.

KING: You know, should it be removed before you go into a bank? Is it  acceptable as part of that person's culture? Where do you draw the  line between what's right and what's wrong, because some  countries have come down this way and some countries...

CIOBO: Absolutely. And it's hard to delineate, I think, some of these issues  because concurrent with them is also what are the values that  underscore that? You know, there's a general perception that a  burqa is tied also to oppression of females. I'm not saying it's  correct, I'm saying that's a widely held perception.

KING: And a perception held by Western society.

CIOBO: No doubt, no doubt. And that's why I'm saying you can't sort of just  divide the two polls into black and white. They are a lot more  complex than that.

KING: But do you have a view there?

CIOBO: Look, I think that in my view, in an Australian context, I personally  would have the view that you need to adopt a more Australian style.  So, in my view, someone in a burqa, for example, should not expect  that there would be widespread community acceptance of that.  Even in a pluralistic society like Australia, because I still think that  there is, underscoring that, a view that that is so different as to be  confronting.

EMERSON: And could I pick up Steve's earlier point. He's right. People who are  anxious about immigration, asylum seekers and so on, are not ...  that doesn't mean they're bad people. And Julia Gillard has made  this point. When people from the left of the political spectrum - I'm  not saying particularly the left of the Labor Party - have said, well,  they're racist if they say anything about people arriving by boat.  They're not racist. They are entitled to their view and it's a point that



Julia has made. And we understand about anxieties. Picking up on  the general issue of dress, have a look at the people here. I mean  at the functions in Logan City you rarely see anything more  gorgeous than the women and the men and the little girls in their  traditional African dress and the little boys - they bring a tear to  your eyes. And, you know, if I could dress like that regularly, I think  people would say, ‘well, you're a bit unusual, but you're very well  dressed there mate’.

KING: Well, why no little African dress?

EMERSON: Yeah, a little African dress. We don't need to go into my night-time  habits any further Madonna.

KING: No we certainly don't. And I see the State Minister for  Multiculturism, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has arrived and I  understand she has a red sari. She doesn't have it on, but she's not  listening. We might get her to put it on a little bit later and see how  that goes. You mentioned your electorate. In your electorate, how  multicultural is your electorate? Do you have a favourite restaurant,  ‘ABC no-names’ - but is it Vietnamese, is it Chinese, give us a  flavour of both your electorates. Steven Ciobo, the electorate of  Moncrieff?

CIOBO: My electorate based on the Gold Coast, of course. The Gold Coast  is a very new city as you know Madonna. It's growing rapidly and, of  course, with that growth a large proportion of it has been fuelled by  those that have come from other countries. About 40 per cent of  Gold Coasters have been born elsewhere. So that's almost, you  know, one in two basically. About 20 per cent of my electorate  speak a language other than English at home, so you'll get a  combination of languages. And I don't think that that's unique to the  Gold Coast. That's pretty common across Australia.

KING: Excuse my ignorance, ‘Ciobo’?

CIOBO: Italian

KING: Italian, of course it is.

CIOBO: Italian background, yeah.

KING: How many generations back?

CIOBO: So, my father came out at the end of the Second World War with  the wave of migrants from predominantly Greece and Italy then.  And, you know, and here we are another generation in and I've  been fortunate enough to get into the nation's Parliament.



KING: And you were born here?

CIOBO: Yeah, born in Australia and mum's an Australian and, you know, my  mother's mother and father are English. So, you know, it's that  hybrid that exists across the country.

KING: Craig Emerson?

EMERSON: I'm very multicultural. My mum was Welsh. The electorate of Rankin  covers much of Logan City. Logan City is the most multicultural  place in Australia. Not in terms of the proportion of the population  that was born overseas, but the diversity, the number of different  homelands that are represented in Logan City. And if you go to  Woodridge State School, there is a sea of colour, and I say that in  the most wonderful way, and the way that those kids get on. And  they are blind to the colour of each other. It's just, if you could get  that, that's the melting pot. If you could get that essence and apply it  around Australia, we would have a very harmonious country.

KING: You just said they’re blind to the colour of the person next to them.  Do you remember the first time you met someone who wasn't Anglo  Saxon?

EMERSON: It would probably be Pop Pantis back in Baradine. But I'll tell a quick  story about our son who's now just about to turn 18. When he was  first going to school he talked about his new friend and we asked  what his new friend looked like and he said, ‘oh, he's got black hair’.  And we asked a bit more and he says, ‘he's about this tall’. And  then finally we went to meet his new friend at his parents’ place.  He's a Vietnamese boy. And Tom didn't see that. He just saw that  this is the features of his friend that he was describing to his mum  and dad. And that was a source of great pride to us. But I think it's  just what is going on amongst young people in this country.

KING: Steven Ciobo, the first time you met someone who wasn't…

CIOBO: Oh Madonna, I grew up in Far North Queensland, a little country  town west of Cairns. So, you know, from year one onwards - well,  actually from primary school - sorry, from pre-school, we had  Thursday Islanders and Aboriginal Australians that were in the  class. So I think it's perhaps a little different too, coming from a  family whose father's Italian. And so I also grew up with aunties and  uncles speaking Italian and those types of things. So maybe it's less  confronting for me, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just more used to it but  it’s not an uncommon thing I think across Australia, that’s for sure.

KING: And it's interesting what you say, because it reminds me of a time  last year where we were at church and my five-year-old and then



four-year-old were in church. And you know what, kindergartens  nowadays, they've got to have one of everything, so there's a male  doll and a female doll, a black doll and a white doll. They've got  everything to be politically correct. And my five-year-old, I realised,  had never seen someone from Africa. Because we're in church,  behind this beautifully dressed Sudanese woman, and thank  goodness she had a sense of humour. And my daughter turned  around and started screaming, ‘mum, there's a doll behind us.  There's a singing, living, singing doll behind us’. And she had just  seen what she'd seen at kindergarten and thought this woman was  a live doll. And the woman just couldn't contain herself with the  laughter. She thought it was hilarious. But I thought then, my  children have not had that opportunity and they will, I guess, as they  get older.

EMERSON: I think there's a perception that Queensland, in particular, is an  Anglo Saxon community. And that is a perception held by people in  the southern states. If they come here they realise it's quite  different.

KING: All right. Just before I let you go, can you tell us ... we've had a big  year. There's been a Federal election. We've got a whole make-up  of a new Parliament. If you're looking into the crystal ball of 2011 in  terms of politics, what's something that you predict we will see?  Craig Emerson?

EMERSON: Oh, look, I think that there will be a lot more argument in the  Chamber. That's a good thing I think in terms of overall policy.  People in the community get upset about the tempers that fray in  the Chamber. I do hope that Steven prevails in the Coalition side,  because Steven is in the policy faction of the Liberal Party, a very  small one, but I hope it grows over time. And Tony Abbott has  actually said, ‘maybe we need to develop a few policies’.

KING: It was going to be without politics wasn't it, Steven Ciobo?

EMERSON: Missed it by that much.

CIOBO: You know Madonna, I'd like to applaud Craig's effort, but he just  had to take that partisan shot. But, you know, I would predict next  year it's going to be interesting, Madonna, because we've still got  the reality of the Parliament which is that we've got a hung  Parliament. We've got a minority Government, so that's going to  require a lot of compromise. So I think it will be interesting to see  the way in which policy debates evolve over time. But Madonna,  quickly before we wrap up, I bought, in the spirit of Christmas, a  little Christmas gift for you.



KING: For me?

CIOBO: And that's just a couple of treats that you might enjoy. And more  importantly for Craig, and just to return the one little volley, I bought  for Craig a Christmas gift of a compass so I thought it might help  them find their way.

EMERSON: I hope it's not a moral compass because I've got one of those.

CIOBO: Thanks Madonna.

KING: And Dr Emerson, have you got a present for me?

EMERSON: Yes, next Easter. Remember I gave you Easter eggs last time? And  George criticised me because they weren't from Australia, so I've  learned my lesson.

KING: Look, can I wish you both a very happy Christmas. I look forward to  going Inside Canberra again next year. And the one thing I really  enjoy about my program is you can ask the hard questions, we can  have an argument and at the end of it everyone goes away knowing  everyone else is just doing their job. Dr Craig Emerson, Steven  Ciobo, thank you.

CIOBO: Thanks Madonna.

EMERSON: Thank you Madonna and have a lovely Christmas.
