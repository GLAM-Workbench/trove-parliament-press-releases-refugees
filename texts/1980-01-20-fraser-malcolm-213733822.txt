ELECTORATE TALK

This week I had the pleasure of receiving in Canberra, the  Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Ohira. .

We had extensive discussions covering a wide range of bilateral,  regional and international matters. .  .

I believe our talks were highly productive.

It is a mark of the maturity and strength, of the relationship  between Japan and Australia that a Japanese Prime Minister \ can fly here for a brief visit and, with a minimum of formality, . get down to solid and frank discussions on' the international,  economic and strategic issues which, concern us.

It shows that we have developed an effective working relationship,  over a long period of time, of great mutual benefit.

One of the. more important matters Mr Ohira and I discussed was the  expansion of the. cultural basis of our relationship, so that the  level of understanding between our peoples can reach, the level that  exists between our governments.

Much progress: has: been made, in this area but more .needs to be done. Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   - .Â· Â·  Â·..Â·Â·: Â·. Â·Â· Â· 'Â» Â·  Â·  -Â· Â· : Â·  Â· Â·  v'*/.Â· -...... ,Â·Â·,.Â·Ã¢ÂÂ  ?jÂ·Â· .Â·>'Â·Ã¢ÂÂ *.-. ?.Â·.> Ã¢ÂÂ   . .

We. are taking a number of initiatives: to realise this__

The Australian Government will be contributing to the extension  of the Australia, Japan and Western Pacific Economic Relations  Project at the. Australian National University.

The Japanese private sector is already organising fund raising for  this purpose, and Mr Ohira has indicated that the project had his  co-operation and support. .  '

We are increasing funds for the Australia-Japan Foundation.

We will be pursuing arrangements for working holidays for Australia’s  i and Japan's young people in each, other’s countries.

And we are pressing ahead to reduce air fares to a scale comparable  |  to that already achieved on other international routes out of Australis

In the trading and investment area, I urged Mr Ohira to encourage  ;  greater participation by Japan in the development of Australian  :  resources and energy supplies, and also in putting the two together in  Australia rather than in Japan to produce Australian-processed products

The concept of a Pacific Basin Community was also a major theme of  our discussions. .  Ã¢ÂÂ

The Western Pacific area has abundant human .  and natural resources  and is one of the fastest growing areas in the world.

Japan and Australia will have an important^ co-operative part to play as opportunities grow for greater regional co-operation in , development. .  - '

The Pacific Basin Community concept is a forward looking idea, and  we agreed that as a first step, we will discuss it with our friends  in the r e g i o n .

If the response is encouraging, Australia would be prepared to  sponsor a seminar for this purpose later this year .at the Australian  National University, hopefully one of the first of a series of . such seminars around the region.

I look forward to the further development of this concept if our  consultations with, other countries indicate an interest in taking  it further.

Mr Ohira's. visit came, at a time of increasing international concern  about events in Iran and especially Afghanistan. ’

Mr Ohira assured us - and I quote - "the Japanese position .(on the Soviet invasion, of Afghanistan), is identical to the position , taken by Australia".

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan represents the. greatest, threat  to world peace and stability; since World War II. .  Â· Â· - Â·

We should especially understand the fact that Afghanistan,-  a non-aligne  country, did not prevent it being invaded by the Soviet Union.

And it is absolutely critical that the free world meets the . challenge of impressing upon the Soviet Union an understanding  -  that there are clear limits to its- aggression. . . .  ..  ....... . . . : . v .

If Soviet aggression is allowed to proceed unchecked into the , neighbouring countries: of .Iranand Pakistan, and into the Persian -   Gulf area, the.consequences for the free world would be moment us'V  and disastrous. .. .

Some would argue that this is. a "worst case." option, but our advice  is that the- prospect cannot be ignored. .

It must be anticipated in advance, We. must use our resources to  prevent it. .  '  ... -.....

The overwhelming United Nations vote of condemnation of the ' > Soviet Union's aggression - 10.4 in support, only 18 against -  Ã¢ÂÂ   shows the. depth of world-wide revulsion and concern about what the  Soviet Union, has: done-. .

ÃÂ¯  The challenge is: now, to the. NATO countries in particular, but  also to smaller countries-  and others, in the region, to make known  toÂ· the. Soviet Union that its ruthless opportunism will not be  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  tolerated. .  Â·

We must do what we can to build a free world consensus on these  issues.

With this same objective,  I will shortly be making a working visit  to the United States and to Britian for discussions with Â·   President Carter and Mrs Thatcher.

In addition,  the Foreign Minister,  Mr Peacock, is planning to visit  the ASEAN countries.and India and Pakistan. .  .

We will be discussing with, these various governments the  present international situation and in particular, the implications  for future security and stability following the Soviet invasion  of Afghanistan - an invasion that has given all nations, whether

aligned or non-aligned, cause for grave concern about broader  Soviet ambitions. .

If detente with, the Soviet Union is ever to be restored, and if  nations are ever again, to conduct relations with the Soviet Union  on a basis of trust, it can only be through the free world -

its small, middle and large members alike - showing now the  strength, unity and determination that have characterised its  great achievements in the past.

I believe that in this regard, Australia must not shirk its  responsibilities, and the Government will discharge these in the  long term interests: of all Australians. Â·
