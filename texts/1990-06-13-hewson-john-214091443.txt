TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE - WEDNESDAY 13 JUNE 1990  DR JOHN HEWSON, MP  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

B 6 EO, PROOF COPY ONLY

HEWSON:

I was asked to make some comments on the Maxwell takeover,

proposed takeover, and the refugee question and I guess the  unifying theme to me is one of ad hocery.  Mr Keating, in London,  shooting from the hip, plucking numbers out of the air, ruling  out a takeover before it has been through the foreign investment  review board process.  Then we have Mr Hawke, of course,

reasserting his Leadership last week, picking an issue, the  refugee issue and creating endless confusion which he has  compounded now on two occasions.

It is indicative of the style of Government that we have seen  since the election which is total ad hocery,

JOURNALIST:

What are the foreign review guidelines? Is there a twenty five  per cent limit.

HEWSON: ' '

No. It is a case by case assessment in relation to newsprint and  what would normally happen is that the proposal would go to the  FIRB. It would be worked on by the Treasury and recommendations  would go to the Treasurer. I think, given the nature of that

industry and indeed the whole media area and the need for

restructuring of the media, it would be a fairly important  assessment process that it would have to go through.

JOURNALIST:

Is the limit low?

HEWSON:

I'm not going to prejudge the limit at this point. I can simply  say that it is an industry that has a lot of problems. It needs  to be restructured. There is an offer of some foreign capital.  There are exceptions to Mr Keating's rule, already, in terms of  existing foreign ownership of newsprint. It is rather a novel  procedure to simply rule one out of hand at a point in time

rather than address the issue in the context of the normal FIRB  .  processes.

JOURNALIST:

How do you regard Robert Maxwell?

HEWSON:

Well I don't know h i m .  I've never met him and I don't think it

is a personal judgement that should be made in this case. It is  clearly a process that has to observed.

JOURNALIST:

Would you be happy with a person like Mr Maxwell having a control  in interest in one of Australia's leading newspapers?

HEWSON:

It is not for me to say. I don't know Mr Maxwell. I only know

what I read in some newspapers. But I don't think that is the

issue. The issue is that the Government has established a set  of procedures for foreign investment, review board procedures.   They are well established procedures for reviewing proposals that  involve foreign investment in Australia .and they should be

observed. I think that one of the great ironies of this process  is that the Government is running a set of policies which over  all has, basically, sent the country broke and put it up for sale  at bargain basement prices and now they are selectively saying  this one can go ahead that one can't and so on. They are

changing the rules after the event as they did in terms of

television ownership and their whole foreign investment policy  is in a shambles,  "

JOURNALIST: . . .. ...... -. .....,

How can the Government be blamed for Mr Bond's problems?

HEWSON:

Well, Mr Bond's problems are indicative of a whole host of

problems that emerged in Australia. Now I'm not blaming Mr Bond,  per se, but I would blame them for the environment they created  in Australia, which is one of a very overheated economy

characterised by speculative boom that saw asset prices, real  estate prices, commercial and domestic real estate, share prices  and other things boom out of control. They saw inflation

accelerate dramatically. They created that environment and  they're, in that sense,.responsible for the environment and more  recently they have created the reverse of that environment, that  is they have jammed on the brakes, bounced interest rates up to  record levels, kept them there for record periods and put a lot  of those who were enthusiastically involved in the inflationary  environment now in very difficult financial circumstances.  Now  that is all the outcome of Government policy. They set the

ground rules within which people like Mr Bond or the banks or  anyone else who is involved to play their roles.

JOURNALIST:

(inaudible),. Do you think the decision against Mr Maxwell is a  double standard, bearing in mind the ownership of people like  Rupert Murdoch?

HEWSONi

Well, I think it calls for an answer, doesn't it. It begs the

question why you single out a particular case without a review  while you are out of the country and you've already got, if you  like, exceptions to the rule that he established in London in  existence at the present time. And I don't think Mr Murdoch's

ownership is the only exception. I think if you look at, is it  Provincial Newspapers in Queensland, again there's effectively,  I believe, significant foreign ownership in that as well. Now  if that's the case, it begs the question why not go through the  normal review procedures to determine whether there should or  should not be a takeover.

JOURNALIST:

isn't in the best interests of the country, though, to have the  control of newspapers in the hands of Australians?

HEWSONi

Well, as a general principle media has been separated out as a  whole on that argument. But what we're seeing is ad hoc change  in the rules in relation to news print like we saw an ad hoc

change in the rules^in relation to television ownership just a  few weeks ago. Now there is no logical position being put,

there's been no review process by the Foreign Investment Review  Board to put an argument in relation to this particular proposal.   Now that's normally what you'd go ....that's the procedure you  would go through which would be observed.

JOURNALIST:

On the matter of Chinese students. If you go back to square one  and take away all the confusion that's been there for the past  week... (inaudible)... what do you think is going to happen to

those people?

HBWSONi

Well, there's again, a question of established procedures. The  position is in relation to refugees a case by case assessment of  each case, of looking at each individual, one by one, and

determining whether they satisfy the criteria to be treated as  a refugee in Australia. And that should apply whether its

Chinese students or Cambodian boat people or whoever.

4 .

And that's been our position right through, we just think that  the rules were there,, we've been calling on the Government for  some time to tell us what they would do in relation to the

Chinese students, and that procedure should be followed, I know  it takes resources but it's the only sensible procedure to follow  and it would have avoided all the confusion we've seen.

JOURNALIST:

How do you think they are feeling ... (inaudible)... Australia?

HEWSONi

I imagine they feel totally confused like most other people and  I think it is indicative of the last week that there's been mass  confusion. The students took the view as did just about

everybody else that last week Mr Hawke was saying that they could  stay as permanent residents. He has now changed his position  twice since then and they're left in a position now with great  uncertainty as to whether they can stay or not stay and just how  long they can stay. And in those circumstances they would

obviously be justifiably disturbed about not knowing where they  stand. They can't plan their lives or plan their careers or plan  their family links in some cases. I think the only fair thing  is to go back to the procedure that has existed in an

unquestioned and bipartisan way and its a case by case

assessment. .

JOURNALIST:

He says he's, he's j.ust been misunderstood.

HF.WSON:

Everybody but Bob Hawke misunderstood, if that is the case. I  don't believe, it was fairly clear cut statement that they were  to be a special category week, it was expanded on in a second  interview last week. You know, I think he has then changed his  mind twice since then, one in the ALB Conference in NSW and then  yesterday at a press conference. As we said yesterday what

started out as confusion is a fiasco. The students are

justifiably disturbed.

JOURNALIST: Ã¢ÂÂ

Why do you think he would change his mind, if ... (inaudible)

HEWSONi

That he's been trying to recover the ground he lost, if you like.  Last week I think he grabbed that issue to reassert his position,  to prove his leadership, and so on. He went off half-cocked, he  obviously hadn't gone through Cabinet.

5 .

Its unclear whether the relevant Minister, Gerry Hand, knew about  it or the extent to which he knew about it. He made policy on

the run, just as in the foreign investment case. And he's tried  to recover the lost ground. In his terms I think the lost ground  would be determined by the extent to which he aggravated the  whole Australian community as well as, in particular, the ethic  community, by that sort of decision. A jump away from standard,  well established practice in relation to refugees.

JOURNALIST:

Given that the likelihood of reprisal if they did go back now,  don't you think that these students are worthy of a special  category, a special dispensation?

HEWSONi

If they've got a genuine case as you're putting it to me, then  I imagine that they would qualify under a DORS Committee review.  I think that the procedures are there. A key element is whether  they'll be subject to reprisal if they return to their country,  and if those decisions stand the test of that Committee then of  course they'd stay. But I think the only fair way to do it, the  only way to get a just and a compassionate outcome is to put them  through on a case by case basis through that assessment.

Thank you.
