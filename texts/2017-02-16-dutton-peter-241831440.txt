E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

RAY HADLEY:

Minister good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

You’ve upset a number of left leaning Magistrates with your comments on my  programme regarding the completely unacceptable situation in Queensland where  we saw Teresa Bradford killed by her husband shortly after being released on bail.

Judicial Conference of Australia President Justice Robert Beech-Jones has accused  you of undermining the judiciary in a letter to The Courier Mail. He said the judiciary  does not engage in such attacks upon the executive and the executive must not  attack the judiciary. Justice Beech-Jones said the fact the attack was made by a  Government Minister was inconsistent with the respect that must be afforded by the  various branches of government towards each other. Do you stand by your  comments?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, it is hard to pick it up on radio, but that was me just having a big yawn. I don’t  think you can worry too much about these things. I mean if people want to be  precious, let them be precious.

My view is that the judiciary has a responsibility to the public and when I came into  Parliament 15 years ago, having been a policeman for 10 years before that, I vowed

to do what I could to make our community a safer place. I have never been  intimidated by anyone and I don’t intend to start now. I’ll stand up for what I believe  in and I want to make our country a safer place, particularly for older Australians who  should after a lifetime of work be able to go about their lives and enjoy their lives with  their grandkids and everything else.

And if the judiciary makes a mistake then they should be held to account. And if  Annastacia Palaszczuk and others are going to continue to appoint Magistrates that  allow people bail in circumstances that they shouldn’t be given bail or penalties that  are woefully inadequate then I don’t think any of us should be afraid to call that out.

RAY HADLEY:

Well remarkably a Magistrate that I’ve discussed previously - because of you,  protesters on the roof of your Electorate Office - has come to my attention again,  Trevor Morgan.

He yesterday released a male person on one condition, one condition for bail, who  had breached a domestic violence order against a partner I presume, nine times,  evaded police once, broke and enter into the partner’s house, then allegedly slashed  her tyres. Police objected vehemently to the persons bail, concerns for his escalating  behavior and no regard to the domestic violence order put in place, seeing he  breached it nine times, but old mate Trevor gave him bail.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, I mean the case on the Gold Coast and many others that you see on a  regular basis, it is unacceptable where people are getting bail, in my judgement and  Magistrates can speak for themselves. I mean let’s hear from the head of this judicial  council or whatever they are to explain to the public why that’s acceptable. I mean let  him come onto your programme and explain to your listeners why it is acceptable for  somebody in that circumstance to be granted bail.

RAY HADLEY:

Well Justice Robert Beech-Jones would be a most welcome guest as a Judicial  Conference of Australia President to explain how Trevor Morgan in light of the death  of that young woman whose funeral was yesterday, how he can allow someone to  walk free despite police saying his behavior is escalating - in other words we are  fearful of what he will do next.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, I think there’s a big issue in Queensland with the laws. I think Annastacia  Palaszczuk has accepted that the Government of Queensland has failed here and  they are talking about a reverse onus in relation to bail. I know Tim Nicholls has been  pushing hard on this issue and he should because he is reflecting the views of the  community and the view of the community is that in a civilised society, like the one  we live in, people respect older people within family units or within society. People

should be respectful, young people in particular respectful to people that are older  than themselves and in relationships, in marriages, in families, violence, like that, is  not to be tolerated. We’re very clear as a society that we don’t want to tolerate  violence against women in particular and the Magistrates, the Judges, should reflect  that community view and that’s the responsibility that they owe.

They don’t need to be offended by what I’ve said. They need to heed the view of the  Australian public and I believe very strongly that if they want to embark on this  particular path then they need to come out and explain why they are doing it.

RAY HADLEY:

US officials have arrived on Manus Island to conduct interviews with refugees in  preparation for this swap deal. What is the process they’re going through? Are you  aware of it or do they act autonomously?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, I can confirm that we have US officials up on Manus Island at the moment.  They have been previously on Nauru and there will be another contingent of US  officials to go to Nauru shortly.

The reason for that is that they’re conducting interviews with people on the two  islands with a view to having them settle in the United States and our desire always  has been to get people off as quickly as possible with the priority being women and  children.

There are no women or children up on Manus Island, only on Nauru, so they will  interview the males up there. And ultimately though, as is the case for our country, I  mean it is our Government that decides who comes here and we decide if we are  going to deport people etc, but in the US they obviously have sovereign right as well.

Now Ray, I’m being told there is a division so I’m going to have to head off mate I’m  sorry.

RAY HADLEY:

Alright, no, no, we understand fully. We understand fully. We’ll come back to you a  bit later if it is applicable. Peter Dutton in the Canberra studio.
