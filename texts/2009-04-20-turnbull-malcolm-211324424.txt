20 April 2009

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP   INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY  ABC RADIO NATIONAL

Subjects: Labor’s failed policies on people smuggling; Julie Bishop.

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………...

KELLY:

Malcolm Turnbull, good morning?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning Fran.

KELLY:

Do you think Australia has a soft immigration policy?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well thereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt itÃ¢ÂÂs been perceived as being soft and that was predicted…..

KELLY:

Is that the same thing?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well it is effectively the same thing. It was predicted as that last year. YouÃ¢ÂÂll recall Steve Cook, whoÃ¢ÂÂs the  Chief of Mission of the International Organisation for Migration in Indonesia said late last year, and IÃ¢ÂÂm  quoting him; “people smugglers have clearly noted that there has been a change in policy and they are  testing the envelope.”

Now that is an expert in immigration, in Indonesia last year, commenting on the Rudd GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  changes. They were seen as softening our border protection policies, and as Mr Cook said, the people  smugglers have been testing the envelope and weÃ¢ÂÂve had more arrivals since the policies were changed in

August, then we have had, nearly twice as many in fact then weÃ¢ÂÂve had in the last six years - this is a  dramatic increase.

KELLY:

Well letÃ¢ÂÂs talk perceptions and reality. Soft in what area? In your view what has the Rudd Government done  wrong, what would you change, what should you change?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I think weÃ¢ÂÂve got to focus on the Rudd GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs policy Fran. IÃ¢ÂÂll come back to where I think we  should aim to go ideally.

KELLY:

Where is it wrong?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Where it is wrong is in sending the signals. You were just talking to Michelle about the temporary protection  visas and I think she fairly described them as making the achievement of permanent status in Australia less  certain for people who arrive by boat - that was their deliberate purpose as disincentive.

You see what should be…letÃ¢ÂÂs step back and ask ourselves objectively and coolly and calmly, what should  be the objective of our policy? The objective of our policy should be no unauthorised boats, boat arrivals.  We donÃ¢ÂÂt want them. ItÃ¢ÂÂs bad in terms of our….the integrity of our borders and it also poses enormous  danger to life and limb on the high seas - not just of the passengers but as weÃ¢ÂÂve seen also of our Navel  personnel.

So in an ideal world no boats would come. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what we want to achieve. So we have to send a message  that we are not receptive to unauthorised boat arrivals. Now the Howard Government had achieved that in a  number of ways when wherever possible the Navy turned boats around and sent them back to Indonesian  territorial waters. You had the Pacific Solution, now where people were processed offshore, in Manus and  Nauru - that of course has been superseded by Christmas Island - so you have an offshore processing centre  there.

You also had….and that meant that they were processed under the UN rules not without access to the  Australian legal system. So that was a discrimination against unauthorised boat arrivals - again a very  deliberate disincentive. Christmas Island has been continued…is in operation. But then you had the  temporary protection visa regime which the Government abandoned in August because it said it had had no  effect. Events since then suggest that they were wrong. I think indicate overwhelmingly that they were  wrong and that was something where the Government has unquestionably softened our policy.

KELLY:

So as Opposition Leader are you calling for reinstatement, reintroduction of temporary protection visas?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

What IÃ¢ÂÂm calling for Fran firstly is for the Government to tell us the facts. We need to know….

KELLY:

….no, no thatÃ¢ÂÂs a separate thing, weÃ¢ÂÂll get to that story in a moment, weÃ¢ÂÂll get to the details of this....in terms  of softening, which you and your Immigration Shadow say the Government has softened its message, should  it reintroduce temporary protection visas?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Certainly the reintroduction of temporary protection visas should be high on the agenda but what IÃ¢ÂÂm calling  for on the Government to do is firstly to release all of the information about the incident on the boat. It is  unbelievable that the Government is stonewalling on this. They have all the facts. All of the Navel personnel  are back. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve all been interviewed. A number of the asylum seekers have been interviewed. The public  are entitled to know what happened.

Secondly; it is clear enough that the AFP has given advice to the Government about the impact of their  softening of our border protection policies on people smuggling and it appears that that advice is consistent  with what most people would say is commonsense and of course what Mr Cook said, you know in the  remarks I quoted earlier.

Now we need to see that advice. That too should be made public because it is plain enough that the  GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs policy is not working. Now we should have all of those facts on the table and what we would  like to do is sit down with the Government and discuss what policies can be changed, how we can have a  different approach that will get the result we all seek, which is to have no people smuggling at all.

You see the difficulty is Mr RuddÃ¢ÂÂs trying to blame this now on push factors. Those push factors have  always been there. Afghanistan has been in a sorry state for many years. Iraq in many respects, in fact in  almost every respect, is a much more peaceful place, relative to what it was four or five years ago….

KELLY:

…I donÃ¢ÂÂt think the same could be said for Afghanistan as Sri Lanka and if youÃ¢ÂÂre going to quote the IOM  you should also acknowledge the UNHCR says there are more people on the move right now because of  push factors. But just before going down that debate we should stick with what we need to do here in this  country and I want to ask you directly about the cover-up claims in a moment, but just finishing on  temporary protection visas. The Immigration Department says on its website that TPVÃ¢ÂÂs led to more asylum  seekers resorting to people smugglers because it put an end to……

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

…well thatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly what they did say Fran and the curious thing about that is that during the period of the  TPVÃ¢ÂÂs you had hardly any boats arriving…..

KELLY:

…not initially, initially you had boats arriving with a lot of women and children - tragically SIEVX was one  of them.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Fran, between 2002 and the end of 2008, fiscal year 2008, there were around half as many people arriving as  have arrived since August last year. So the fact of the matter is since the TPVÃ¢ÂÂs were abolished by the Rudd  Government there has been a dramatic increase. Now bear this in mind, the people smugglers are a business.  They are charging people big money and they cannot succeed in their business unless they can get people  into Australia.

So perceptions are very important and if a government gives the perception that it is softening its policy, and  this is what Mr Cook was saying from the International Office of Migration last year, if they give the  perception that theyÃ¢ÂÂre softening their policy, the people smugglers will seize on that and say to their  potential customers; look, AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs a softer target now, line up, letÃ¢ÂÂs get a boat and off we go.

KELLY:

Does the Opposition share some responsibility for that? I mean in terms of perceptions itÃ¢ÂÂs the Opposition  shouting out to the world that the Labor GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs policy is softer, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Oh please, please, you canÃ¢ÂÂt blame us for the Rudd GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs policies. We warned that this would send  the wrong signal months before they actually made the change. We warned them. We did the right thing. We  said we believe this will send the wrong signal. The Government said no, we know better, it wonÃ¢ÂÂt make any  difference. Now there has been a dramatic difference.

Now let me just step forward and letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about how we might be able to get a better resolution here.  ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt that the ideal outcome, least from our point of view, and I think from most Australians  point of view, is that no boats left Indonesia at all. So clearly we need to ensure that this becomes a criminal  offence in Indonesia - which it isnÃ¢ÂÂt. So thatÃ¢ÂÂs where thereÃ¢ÂÂs a need for persuasion, cooperation, engagement  with the Indonesians…..

KELLY:

So you welcome the Prime Minister talking to the President?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Of course I welcome him talking to the President of Indonesia but every Australian Prime Minister has  talked regularly to the President of Indonesia, itÃ¢ÂÂs an ongoing discussion, we have a very close relationship.

But in an ideal world, as much processing as possible would happen in Indonesia. Now that would be the  ideal situation where people who came to Indonesia with the aim of going by boat to Australia instead were  detained in Indonesia and were processed appropriately by the UN High Commission on Refugees in  Indonesia.

Now of course youÃ¢ÂÂd need the Indonesian, naturally, youÃ¢ÂÂd need the Indonesian GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs agreement  and commitment to that but that would be the best outcome because what we want to achieve is no boats, no  boats leaving Indonesia and every aspect of policy should be directed towards that.

KELLY:

LetÃ¢ÂÂs go to this incident and this tragic incident and this boat. YouÃ¢ÂÂve said that the Rudd Government is  covering up. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs it got to cover up here? I mean, why does it matter?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, Fran, I think what IÃ¢ÂÂve said is it starts to look like a cover-up.

KELLY:

Sure, I beg your pardon.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

The reality is when governments know the facts - and this Government does know the facts and has known  the facts for some time - and declines to make them public, after a time even the most devoted admirers of  the Rudd Government start to wonder why theyÃ¢ÂÂre not Ã¢ÂÂfessing up and putting the facts on the table and it  starts to look like a cover-up. So if the Rudd Government wants to dispel the suggestion that itÃ¢ÂÂs a cover-up,  all it needs to do is tell the truth.

KELLY:

Are you concerned about the details of why this, how this happened? I mean, does it matter how this fire  started? Does it really matter in terms of the policy debate weÃ¢ÂÂre now having in this country?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, at least three people have been killed, several, 30 have been seriously injured, three Australian Naval  personnel have been injured. This is a very serious incident. Of course weÃ¢ÂÂre entitled to know what caused  it. Its vital public interest to know what caused it.

KELLY:

Do you accept that the Rudd Government initially said it was more appropriate to wait for the official  version to come out and not leap ahead as happened in the children overboard debate? Do you accept  that…..

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

This has got nothing to do… weÃ¢ÂÂre not talking about past issues or past events. We are…

KELLY:

I suppose what IÃ¢ÂÂm saying is it valid for them to say weÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for the police….

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

How many days, I think weÃ¢ÂÂre now, is it five days since these events. I mean this is a long time. This is a  tragic event and our sympathy, our prayers indeed, are with the victims of this tragedy who, and I might say  our admiration is with the Australian service personnel and the Navy and the Police and of course the  extraordinary work of the doctors and medical staff at the hospitals around Australia who are dealing with  these victims of this terrible disaster.

Look, this is a dreadful tragedy Fran, but we are entitled to know what happened because this is a matter of  vital public interest so the Government should stop playing games and they should… they know whatÃ¢ÂÂs  happened, they know full well whatÃ¢ÂÂs happened. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve known for some time. They should tell the truth.  ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all weÃ¢ÂÂre asking them to do: tell the truth. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt always come easily to Mr RuddÃ¢ÂÂs Government  but this is what he should do, he should just grit his teeth and tell the truth.

KELLY:

Do you accept this is a delicate debate in our nation to handle? I mean youÃ¢ÂÂre calling for bi-partisan  approach. Your spokesperson…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

IÃ¢ÂÂm calling for him to tell the truth.

KELLY:

Sure, and youÃ¢ÂÂre calling for bi-partisanship on the way forward to deal with it.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, I would welcome the opportunity to sit down with Mr Rudd to get a full briefing on the security  information and intelligence theyÃ¢ÂÂve had. You know, the Government says these changes in Australian  policy have not had an impact on people smuggling. That just strains credulity. ItÃ¢ÂÂs unbelievable. You  canÃ¢ÂÂt… you get…from August when the policy was changed you get a dramatic increase in boats and the  Government says thatÃ¢ÂÂs a coincidence. ItÃ¢ÂÂs simply not credible and so clearly Fran, the policy isnÃ¢ÂÂt working.

Now what the Government has to do is just like theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to tell the truth about what happened on the  boat, theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to tell the truth, face the facts that their policy has failed, that they are not adequately  protecting our borders, that their policies are perceived as being soft and that is encouraging people  smuggling and they have to change the policies. Now IÃ¢ÂÂm happy to sit down with Mr Rudd and engage with  him to see if thereÃ¢ÂÂs something we can agree on. I think it would be good if there was collective agreement  and a common will to stamp out people smuggling.

KELLY:

Okay. And perceptions versus reality I guess is a lot of what itÃ¢ÂÂs all about. Just finally, Malcolm Turnbull,  Julie Bishop, is she your choice as Deputy, is there an effort in your Party to knock her off?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Julie Bishop is a wonderful Deputy; sheÃ¢ÂÂs a very dear friend of mine and has been for 20 years. She has total  support from the Party Room. I know the stories youÃ¢ÂÂre referring to. IÃ¢ÂÂve been reading political reports and  columns and journalism for more than 30 years, Fran and IÃ¢ÂÂve never read anything so baseless and absurd as  that suggestion, so Julie has my total support and the PartyÃ¢ÂÂs total support and she deserves it because sheÃ¢ÂÂs  doing an outstanding job.

KELLY:

Malcolm Turnbull, thank you.
