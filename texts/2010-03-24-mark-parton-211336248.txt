TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES  INTERVIEW WITH MARK PARTON  2CC CANBERRA  EO&E...........................................



Subjects: Christmas Island, Health Debate

MARK PARTON:

Senator Gary Humphries, Liberal Senator for the ACT, Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for  Citizenship and I bet you’d like to see an asylum seeker debate at the National Press Club Gary?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Yes I would, that’d be a very interesting exercise! But as you say, not one likely to occur in this  campaign.

MARK PARTON:

You’ve described Christmas Island as a sort of express lane for asylum seekers, that when you’re all  loaded up with your trolley at Wollies, you want to get through quick, you just head to Australia.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well look in the last 5 days we’ve seen 4 boats arrive.  That’s the highest rate of arrivals in a long,  long time, probably ever.  Christmas Island is now bursting at the seams.  I think it’s 2040 beds on the  island - that’s almost certainly going to be exceeded with these last few arrivals, and it’s going to  mean that those peoples are going to start getting transferred straight to the Australian mainland.

MARK PARTON:

And yet we still don’t have confirmation of that from the Government.  They refuse to be drawn into  speculating when that’s going to happen.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well the Government seems to be getting less and less forthright with the information that’s available  about what’s happening with these arrivals and that’s getting very disturbing.  We need to know what  the policies are and exactly what’s going on.  Of course they described the Christmas Island facility  when it was built by the Howard Government as a “white elephant”, unnecessary, and now it’s so full  after them having had to expand it to accommodate the extra arrivals that they’re now looking at  moving people on to the Australian mainland at Darwin.  Now if people come on boats and they are  transferred to the Australian mainland first of all there’s a question of Australian laws with respect to  the right to review decisions in courts, and secondly it’s also a psychological barrier broken down.   People are more or less going straight from Indonesia, straight to the Australian mainland and it must  be a powerful selling point for the people smugglers to be able to say ‘I can get you on a boat and you  can be in Darwin or somewhere on the Australian mainland a few weeks later’.  That’s a very  dangerous impasse.

MARK PARTON:

Gary you made an interesting point there earlier when you said that when the Rudd Government was  in opposition they declared the Christmas Island facility was a big white elephant.  Herein lies one of  the great problems, in that so much of this debate is caught up in party politics and it’s not always  productive.  I don’t know that we’re going to be able to find a way to move forward when both sides -  and you’re guilty of it too - are just sniping at each other.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well I think in this situation we’re making an extremely valid point about the fact that two or three  years ago there was a policy in place on Australia’s borders which actually deterred the boats from  arriving.  In the last four or five years of the Howard Government there was an average of two boats  arriving each year.  So very small numbers, clearly it was a policy which was discouraging arrivals by  boat.  In August 2008 the Rudd Government changed the policy settings and the boats started to  arrive.  Thousands upon thousands of people have arrived since that change in the policy settings.   That goes beyond politics in my view.

MARK PARTON:

Look I tend to agree with you, and I know there will be a lot of focus this morning on this UN report  because Kevin Rudd and various ministers have continued to say this is just about a global climate as  far as refugees go …

GARY HUMPHRIES:

But it’s not, it’s not.  Look last year, 2009, Australia experienced a 30% increase in applications for  asylum on our shores, but places like Britain had a 6% decline in applications.  Now if people are  being pushed out of Afghanistan and Iraq and places like that why are they coming to Australia and  being pushed towards Australia and not being pushed towards countries like Britain.

MARK PARTON:

These figures that Gary mentions have not come off the back of a cereal box or anything like that,  they’ve come from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which released the global report on  annual asylum trends, and they fly in the face of what the Rudd Government’s been telling us.  The

number of refugees seeking asylum in Australia jumped by almost 30% last year despite global  numbers remaining steady.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

That’s right, and it’s just too incredible to believe that our own domestic policies and the way in  which we present signals to people smugglers doesn’t make a difference in the number of people who  come here courtesy of those people smugglers.  Clearly something happened in the second half of  2008 to turn on the tap, and the only thing that happened in terms of global activities was that  Australia announced a new policy with respect to asylum seekers, it relaxed our policy and undid

some of the work that the Howard Government had done, and the boats started to arrive.  I’m soryr,  that’s not due to international factors, that’s our own domestic that’s caused a considerable part of that  flow of people.

MARK PARTON:

Gary were you at the Press Club yesterday?

GARY HUMPHRIES:



Yes I was.

MARK PARTON:

And what did you think of the whole thing?  What did you think of your leader’s performance?  Come  on, be honest.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well it was hand-to-hand combat.  It was like watching a boxing match actually, the two leaders  sparring away there.  I think it was - personally, it was too early to have a debate about health, but the  Labor party only just put that policy on the table, and there were still so many questions about it, and  we as you know haven’t put our policy on the table there fully - although there are elements of it  there already.  And yet the PM wanted a debate a couple of days after he announced his policy.  It was  clearly a setup, and let me say as well that that’s going to count in the PM’s mind as one of the three  election debates that he as opposition leader promised would happen during the election campaign.   So it’s also an exercise in running and hiding and avoiding accountability.  Why wasn’t it happening  in prime time in the evening so people could watch it instead of in the middle of the day while people  are at work?

MARK PARTON:

The PM performed quite well though.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

He did, yes, he did.   But as you said before this is safe ground for Labor.  This is an area they would  count as their own.  They’ve just announced a new policy, and people are unsure what the policy  says.  The Premiers themselves don’t know what the policy’s about, and details were being announced  during the debate yesterday.  So we’re all finding out what’s going on, and they wanted us to rush in  and press home an advantage by having a debate at that point.  Smart politics maybe, but not very  enlightening for many people who actually wanted to know what the difference between the two  parties is on health.

MARK PARTON:

Thanks for your time Gary.
