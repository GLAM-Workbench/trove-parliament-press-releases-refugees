E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

CHRIS SMITH:

Mr Abbott, good afternoon.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Chris.

CHRIS SMITH:

Now, this is not just Villawood. It’s Christmas Island, it’s Darwin, it’s Broadmeadows, it’s Curtin, it’s  Tassie and it goes on and on. We have got to a ridiculous place where these asylum seekers have spent 24  hours holding emergency services and the Government to ransom. Why did we get to this point? How did  we get to this point?

TONY ABBOTT:

Chris, we got to this point because the Government lost control of our borders and now we’ve got a  detention system that’s in crisis because we’ve got too many people and they’re there for a long time and  these sorts of passions boil over but I think what we have got fundamentally to do here is to treat criminal  acts like criminal acts and we’ve got to give these people the clear understanding if they commit criminal  acts they won’t get permanent residency in Australia. If you’ve got a criminal record you aren’t normally  granted permanent residency in Australia if you apply to migrate through the normal channels and certainly  these illegals should not get permanent residency if while in these detention centres they are guilty of crimes  because that’s what they are. There are criminal acts taking place against Australian Government officials  and agents and crimes against Australian Government, Australian taxpayer property.

CHRIS SMITH:

I’ve just played some of what Chris Bowen the Immigration Minister had to say in response to last night a  short time ago. It was weak, it was wishy-washy and it was almost identical to what we heard from him after  the Christmas Island latest drama where he said ‘oh, the AFP will go in to investigate, they’ll be getting  entry soon’. All the same kind of template and I just wonder whether the Minister is up to it or whether he  should be arts minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not saying that this is an easy situation to manage. If you had a problem like this in any other  institution it would be a difficult problem to manage but in the end criminal acts are criminal acts and the  police need to act firmly against people who are engaging in criminal conduct and just because they’re  people who’ve come illegally to Australia by boat and they’re in a detention centre doesn’t mean that these  things aren’t crimes.

CHRIS SMITH:

I’ve been receiving calls today on what we’ve got to do. There are ideas out there about we should be doing  this, we should be doing that and then several calls saying well what about the Coalition, do they have, you  know, serious policies to make a change to this and stop the flows and stop the burning down of detention  centres? If there was a Tony Abbott Coalition government, you were in power, what absolute concrete  things could you do in the first month as far as policy is concerned, immigration policy, to make a difference  and to stop a repeat of what we’ve seen at Christmas Island and Villawood?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look at what the Howard Government did, Chris. The Howard Government stopped the boats because  John Howard was prepared to take the not always popular but tough measures necessary to deprive the  people smugglers of a product to sell. Now, we would first of all ensure that there were temporary protection  visas, not permanent residency, for people who came illegally by boat. We would ensure that processing was  done rigorously and offshore. We would reopen the Nauru centre. We would send a very strong signal to the  people smugglers and their customers and, look, you’ve got to have the option of turning boats around. It’s  not always possible, you could not lightly take additional risks but it’s got to be an option and I think that  much in all as it caused John Howard a lot of grief with a lot of decent, high-minded people, the Tampa  incident sent a very strong to the world that the Australian Government was determined to take charge of its  borders and we can’t shrink from these things. They’re not pretty, a lot of people will be anxious about it,  but in the end a sovereign government has to be prepared to use tough measures to keep its borders secure.

CHRIS SMITH:

Now you’ve announced today, and this is a pity because it’s corresponded on a day when people are wanting  to talk about what’s going on at Villawood, but anyway you’ll spend $300 million on helping the mentally  ill return to work. It’s a big boost to a $2 billion plan you have in this area. You’ve recognised that mental  health affects nearly half the population, but mental health spending is only six per cent of the health budget.  Gee, we don’t look after these people, do we?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s the hidden epidemic. Because so many people with mental health problems don’t speak up, often  they don’t even seek help, it tends to get ignored. I mean even sometimes the family members of people  with mental health difficulties don’t realise for years just what their loved ones are going through. I mean,  I’ve got a friend and colleague, Andrew Robb, who grappled for years with a form of depression and he  suffered in silence. Now, eventually he decided there’s got to be a better way and he sought treatment and  after a bit of experimentation to get the treatment regime right he is vastly better and brighter than ever  before and a guy like Andrew thinks, ‘my God, why did I spend forty years grappling with this when I could  have sought treatment and been infinitely better?’

CHRIS SMITH:

Well, there’s almost this great taboo area, especially amongst men, no one really wants to talk about it or  admit what may be going on.

TONY ABBOTT:

If we break our arm, we think that’s just bad luck and we go and get treatment, but if we are feeling  depressed, I mean chronically depressed as opposed to just a bit down sometimes, we tend to think it’s a  sign of weakness and we don’t like to admit it. It is a real male problem, Chris, you’re absolutely right and,  you know, soldiering on is admirable in a way but if you are soldiering on with something which is  chronically debilitating and damaging your ability to cope with life and build relationships, well, you’ve got  to face up to it and the best way to face up to it is probably to go and see the GP and say ‘look, I’ve got a  problem doctor’. Most GPs are good at dealing with this these days. Certainly, the Howard Government  made it a lot easier for GPs to deal with mental health issues, gave them a lot more resources, gave them  access to Medicare-funded psychologists consultations on referral and that’s been good but there’s always  more to be done and the additional $430 million that I announced today on top of the $1.5 billion that we  announced during the election is, I think, a substantial improvement to mental health services. It isn’t going  to cure the problem, it doesn’t mean in the future there won’t be more that’s required but I think it’s a big  step forward and my challenge to the Prime Minister is please match this, even better it, and one of the good  things that oppositions can do if the Government has ears to listen is propose things which everyone thinks  are right but which a distracted Government is not focused on and force the Government to do what it  should’ve done a long time ago.

CHRIS SMITH:

Yep. That’s a very good point. I’ve got to go and I’ve got to let you go. Thank you very much for your time  this afternoon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Chris.
