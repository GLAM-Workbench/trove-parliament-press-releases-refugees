Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats     June 19, 2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                                    03/ 440



Govt Must Accept Historic Court Decision: Let Children Go Free

Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock must accept that locking children in immigration detention  centres is incredibly harmful and against the law, the Australian Democrats said today.

In a landmark decision, the Family Court today ruled that indefinitely detaining children on  immigration issues was unlawful.

Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said Mr Ruddock considering an appeal was not only  another display of incredible heartlessness, but a waste of taxpayers money.

“Why is the Minister considering wasting taxpayers money by appealing this decision.

“Why can’t he just accept that locking up children in immigration detention centres is incredibly  harmful.  Why can’t he let them go free?” Senator Bartlett said.

“The cold hearted actions by this Minister continue to astound us.  The fact that he is unable to  accept a decision by a court that specialises in the welfare of children shows that he just does not  care.

“Immigration detention centres are no place for children.  This is a landmark decision by the Family  Court and one which would be welcomed by every single Australian who cares for children   and children’s rights.”

Senator Bartlett said Mr Ruddock’s move to consider an appeal further demonstrated his  unwillingness to accept the rules of law.

And the Government’s response in Question Time that considering an appeal against the Family  Court decision was “thoroughly reasonable” was plain callous.

“This will be another attack on the powers of the court.  It is an outrageous attack on the freedoms  of children and the authority of our courts by this increasingly uncaring and distant Government.”
