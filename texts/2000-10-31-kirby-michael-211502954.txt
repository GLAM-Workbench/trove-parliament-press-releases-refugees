CHAMPIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
This week Australia honours two fine men, champions in the field of 
human rights.Â  The first is the late Ron CastanÂ QC whose name 
has been given to the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University 
in Melbourne, launched today.Â  The other is the late DrÂ Jonathan 
Mann.Â  He will be remembered at a function in Sydney organised 
by the AIDS Trust of Australia on 3 November 2000.Â  There, the 
Federal Minister for Health and Family Services (DrÂ Michael Wooldridge) 
will announce scholarships, supported by the Australian Government, 
to honour Mann's name.Â

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Both Ron Castan and Jonathan Mann were friends of mine.Â  Both were 
young men lost at the height of their powers.Â  Ron Castan died 
last year of a complication following surgery.Â  Jonathan Mann was 
killed in September 1998 when a plane, on which he was travelling from 
New York to Geneva, crashed off the coast of Canada.Â  Both men 
were charismatic, courageous and dedicated to fundamental human rights 
not only in their own countries but far way.Â  Ron Castan was a 
first rate technical lawyer whose brilliant legal mind planned and executed 
the change in Australian law regarding Aboriginal land rights known 
as the   Mabo Case  [1]  .Â    Jonathan Mann was an outstanding epidemiologist.Â  He was serving 
in Zaire (now Congo) when HIV/AIDS first appeared.Â  He immediately 
saw the mighty challenge for humanity and for medicine.Â  He perceived 
the paradoxical link between protecting the human rights of those most 
at risk of HIV and stemming the spread of the epidemic.Â  Both men 
were JewishÂ - proud of their faith and culture.Â  But neither 
took a narrow view of religion.Â  Each had a big heart, only matched 
by a big mind driven by great love for humanity.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
It is no accident that these two men were Jewish.Â  Each of them 
learned at their parents' knees the vital importance of   Chesed  Â - the Hebrew word for the loving-kindness that God manifests 
towards every living creature.Â  That word "loving kindness", 
or some similar notion, is found in all of the world's great religions.Â  
It is the essence of the idea that underpins the global movement to 
uphold fundamental human rights.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
It is not entirely coincidental that Castan and Mann were champions 
of human rights.Â  The world movement for the protection of such 
rights is itself, in part, the outcome of the settlement that followed 
the establishment of the United Nations after the Second World War.Â  
In the aftermath of that War were discovered the grim horrors of the 
Holocaust.Â  They revealed the many victims of Hitler's tyranny.Â  
These included members of many minoritiesÂ - communists, gipsies, 
Jehovah's Witnesses, the intellectually impaired and homosexuals.Â  
They were victims of hate because they were different.Â  However, 
by far the greatest suffering fell upon the Jewish people of Europe.Â  
Their stories are heart-rending.Â  We must never forget them.Â  
Ron Castan and Jonathan Mann did not forget.Â  They turned the dreadful 
experiences of their people into a zeal for action to protect fundamental 
human rights wherever they were threatened.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
The gesture of the Australian government to honour Jonathan Mann with 
the award of scholarships for research by Australians into aspects of 
HIV/AIDS is most welcome.Â  There can be no better memorial for 
a creative scientist than an intellectual commitment of that kind.Â  
It is also wholly fitting that the new Centre for Human Rights Law at 
Monash University should bear Ron Castan's name.Â  With such a name, 
and under the leadership of Professor David Kinley, there is no doubt 
that the Centre will mix, in proper proportions, the demands of dispassionate 
scholarship and a full understanding of the high moral cause which underpins 
the international movement for human rights.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
David Kinley brings from his birthplace, Northern Ireland, a realisation 
of the importance of respect for the human rights of everyone, if law 
and order are to be based on more than the power and force.Â  He 
has built up a strong reputation in Australia.Â  His book on human 
rights explores every nook and cranny of the law in this country as 
it operates to protect fundamental rights  [2]  .Â  Australia is now one of the few countries of the world without 
a constitutional Bill of Rights.Â  I have no doubt that the Castan 
Centre will contribute to the ongoing debate on whether we should change 
that situation, as Britain did  [3]  , or stick with the legal approaches of the past.

Â

Â

Â

THE AGENDA

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
The Centre starts its life with bright hopes on the part of its members, 
the friends of Ron Castan and his family and other supporters.Â  
I wish to venture a few suggestions about topics which should be included 
in its agenda.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Indigenous human rights  :Â  Out of respect 
for Ron Castan, and his leadership in utilising the law as a means of 
protecting and upholding the human rights of Australia's Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander peoples, it must be expected that the Centre 
will include in its programme particular items relevant to those human 
rights.Â  This will not be difficult.Â  In the international 
literature of human rights, the rights of indigenous peoples in settler 
societies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United 
States and Zimbabwe) have attracted much scholarship.Â  Some of 
it concerns the implications for the rights of indigenous peoples within 
a developed polity of the promise in the common first articles to the   International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights   and the   International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights   that "peoples" 
will enjoy a right to self-determination.Â  It is important to make 
the point that this right does not necessarily mean political independence.Â  
But it does involve the concept of effective participation in aspects 
of governance specifically relevant to such peoples.Â

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
In approaching the human rights of the indigenous peoples of Australia, 
it may be hoped that the Centre will exhibit the same questioning approach 
to the law as Ron Castan did.Â  Before the   Mabo   litigation, he had a junior brief in Papua New Guinea to John Kearney 
QC of the Melbourne Bar.Â  They were engaged in a claim for land 
rights of indigenous peoples against the Crown in right of Papua New 
Guinea.Â  Nellie Castan, in that questioning way for which all lawyers 
are grateful to their spouses and partners, demanded to know why such 
a claim could not be made against the Crown in right of Australia.Â  
Ron Castan gave the orthodox explanations:Â  a Privy Council decision; 
established law over a hundred and fifty years; the special need for 
stability of land law and so on.Â  But in the end, he himself began 
to question the orthodoxy.Â  The affront to basic human rights and 
dignity of the old law was challenged.Â  The result was a tectonic 
shift of the law.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
All of us need to be alert to similar blind spots in the law.Â  
Fundamental human rights law can often be a stimulus to re-examination 
and change of established doctrine.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Bangalore Principles:Â    A second issue to which the Centre must contribute concerns the utilisation, 
in Australian courts, of the principles of international human rights 
law.Â  This involves the application of the   Bangalore Principles,   devised in 1988  [4]  .Â  According to those principles, international human rights 
law is not, as such, incorporated in Australia's domestic law unless 
lawfully introduced by an Australian lawmaker.Â  Ordinarily, this 
means an Act of Parliament or valid action of the Executive Government 
pursuant to statutory authority.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
However, in a common law country such as Australia, the judiciary also 
have lawmaking functions, albeit in the minor key.Â  In appropriate 
cases, it is permissible to the judiciary to invoke international human 
rights principles, introducing them into domestic law by judicial decision.Â  
The warrant to do this is stated in a most important passage in Justice 
Brennan's reasons in   MaboÂ v Queensland [No 2]  [5]  .Â  Indeed, that passage, which formed an essential step in the 
reasoning of the High Court in   Mabo   may, in retrospect, come to be seen as the most significant contribution 
of that case to our law.Â  In a sense, it has an importance transcending 
even the issues of indigenous rights with which the case was concerned.Â  
Justice Brennan said:

Â

"The 
common law does not necessarily conform with international law, but 
international law is a legitimate and important influence on the development 
of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence 
of universal human rights.Â  A common law doctrine founded on unjust 
discrimination and the enjoyment of civil and political rights demands 
reconsideration.Â  It is contrary both to international standards 
and to the fundamental values of our common law to entrench a discriminatory 
rule which, because of the supposed position on the scale of social 
organisation of the indigenous inhabitants of a settled colony, denies 
them a right to occupy their traditional lands".

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
According to this notion, then, international human rights law may legitimately 
be invoked, at least in cases of ambiguity, to resolve uncertainties 
in legislative interpretation and to fill gaps in the common law  [6]  .Â  My own view is 
that the same principles may be invoked in construing the Australian 
Constitution which is, after all, a statute, although one of a particular 
character.Â  In   Newcrest Mining (WA) LimitedÂ v The Commonwealth  [7]   I proposed in interpretative principle which I regard as appropriate 
to the elucidation of the meaning of our Constitution in the contemporary 
age  [8]  :

Â

Â "Where 
there is ambiguity in the meaning of the Constitution, ... it should 
be resolved in favour of upholding such fundamental and universal rights.Â  
The Australian Constitution should not be interpreted so as to condone 
an unnecessary withdrawal of protection of such rights.Â  At least 
it should not be so interpreted unless the text is intractable and the 
deprivation of such rights is completely clear.Â  ... [Its] purpose 
is to be the basic law for the government of a free people in a nation 
which relates to the rest of the world in a context in which the growing 
influence of international law is of ever increasing importance"

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Whilst this principle has not yet been accepted by all members of the 
High Court of Australia, I do not doubt that a major challenge of the 
coming century will be the reconciliation of international law with 
Australia's domestic lawÂ -including that of its Constitution.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Bill of Rights:Â    A third project for the 
agenda arises in a connected context.Â  It concerns the question 
whether Australia should now move towards a national legislative, and 
possibly constitutional, Bill of Rights.Â  With the coming into 
force of the United Kingdom   Human Rights Act   of 1998 on 2Â October 2000, Australia is now one virtually alone 
amongst the developed countries of the world in having no general or 
constitutional charter of rights which citizens can invoke when they 
allege that their fundamental rights have been infringed.Â  With 
the centenary of federation, it is important that we reflect upon the 
changes that have occurred in a hundred years that may make it appropriate, 
now, to re-examine this question  [9]  .Â  When in the constitutional debates at the end of the nineteenth 
century the proposal for a Bill of Rights was voted down, Australia 
was substantially a monochrome society with shared values and fewer 
minorities.Â  The situation, in part, is different today.Â  
That is why there is a keen and growing interest in the Bill of Rights 
question.Â  I would expect that this Centre will contribute to the 
national reflections about it.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    The Asia-Pacific region:Â    I would also hope that 
the Centre will reach beyond Australia and involve itself in the human 
rights issues of the region.Â  In my own life, I have had the privilege 
to meet, and work with, some of the leaders of the struggle for human 
rights in Asia and the Pacific.Â  Amongst the most notable of these 
is President KimÂ  Dae-jung of the Republic of Korea.Â  His 
courage, imagination and fortitude have lately been recognised by the 
award to him of the Nobel Prize for Peace.Â  That prize was earlier 
awarded to His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet.Â  These two men 
contradict the suggestion that there is an exception to human rights 
in the countries of our regionÂ - that somehow the nations of Asia 
are exempt from the universal development of human rights law.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
President Kim has been subject to four attempts on his life.Â  He 
was imprisoned for more than six years during his struggle.Â  He 
never lost faith in, and commitment to, fundamental human rights  [10]  .Â  Similarly the Dalai 
Lama has constantly emphasised the need for a peaceful resolution to 
the Tibetans' dispute with China.Â  The Australian Foreign Minister 
(Mr Alexander Downer) informed me recently of his knowledge of the contributions 
which Ron Castan made, during his lifetime, to the attempts to build 
a dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the leaders of the People's Republic 
of China.Â  MrÂ Downer paid tribute to those efforts.Â  
I am glad that the connection of the Castan family with the Dalai Lama 
has continued to this day.Â  May some of his grace and compassion 
shine upon the Centre and inspire in it a concern for human rights law 
beyond Australia, and particularly in the region and the countries surrounding 
us.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Human rights in the future:Â    I also hope that the Centre 
will involve itself in future issues of human rights.Â  Within days 
I will be travelling (economy class as the United Nations requires) 
to Quito in Ecuador.Â  There I will be attending a meeting of the 
UNESCO International Bioethics Committee.Â  Our topic will be the 
Human Genome Project.Â  Contemporary developments in genetics present 
many new issues for human rights and human rights law.Â  Can there 
be any issue of more fundamental importance for the future of human 
rights than who "humans" will be in the coming century?Â  
With the capacity of genetics, potentially, to alter the building blocks 
of human life, this is not a theoretical issue.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Other topics must be placed on the agenda.Â  They include, I think, 
human rights of drug addicted and dependant persons.Â  I suspect 
that, in a decade or so, we will look back on our treatment of drug 
dependence with something of the same embarrassment with which we now 
look back on the criminalisation of private adult consensual homosexual 
conduct twenty years ago.Â  The fact that we now appreciate that 
such laws constituted an over-reach of criminal sanctions, diminishing 
the human rights and dignity of those targeted, should make us alert 
to the danger of similar laws which operate in today's society.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
One reviewer of David Kinley's book (Professor Robert McCorquodale) 
has    suggested  [11]   that its authors were excessively optimistic about the impact of 
human rights law in Australia and about the future of such law.Â  
Professor McCorquodale argued that such impact, in default of enforceable 
rights under a general or constitutional Bill of Rights, depended too 
much on the vagaries of legislative initiatives and judicial imagination.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Recently I received a similar criticism of an essay I have written for   The Stanford Journal of 
Law and Policy.Â    My essay, to be published in 2001, concerns the contrast between the 
law affecting homosexuals in the United States and Australia.Â  
Certainly, in Australia, we can look with pride on the fact that, with 
the assistance of international law, criminal offences against adult 
homosexual conduct have been abolished in all parts of the country.Â  
Likewise, in the Australian Defence Force, there is no ban on homosexuals 
and no "don't ask don't tell" policy, as in the United States.Â  
Nor is there any prohibition on homosexuals in the Boy Scouts in Australia, 
unlike the American counterpart  [12]  .Â

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
The reviewer of my article suggested, however, that I was unduly optimistic.Â  
That attitudinal change in Australia concerning sexuality was still 
slow in coming.Â  That legal discrimination is still common.Â  
That basic human rights are not impartially accorded.Â  Indeed, 
that in my own case, I would not have been appointed to the High Court 
of Australia if I had not earlier gone along with the "don't ask 
don't tell" demand of Australian society.Â  If these criticisms 
are, even in part, true, the issues of sexuality will also present a 
challenge for the future agenda of human rights and this Centre.Â  
Clearly there will be plenty to do.Â  One hopes that the Centre 
will have support, both intellectual and financial, to ensure that it 
can fulfil the challenge of these and other agenda items.

Â

Â

Â

THE CRITICS

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
It should not be assumed that human rights law, especially that originating 
in international bodies of the United Nations, enjoys the support every 
Australian citizen.Â  A prominent newspaper  [13]  , commenting recently on the criticisms of Australian legislation 
within UN Committees declared:Â  "The attempts by various UN 
Committees to regulate Australian social policies threaten their own 
credibility more than that of the [Australian] government.Â  The 
UN Committee system is a third-rate, unaccountable, opaque irrelevance 
that is unfit to comment on Australian policy".

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
To like effect was a comment by the well known iconoclast, Padraic McGuinness  [14]  .Â  Writing in September 
2000, he declared in a newspaper column:Â  "... These treaties 
have been used by zealous and inadequately supervised diplomats and 
lawyers as implements for extending their own political power.Â  
... The glaring problem of the UN is what has been called the democratic 
deficit ... [It] is worsened by the active interference in UN activities 
of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which themselves are entirely 
unrepresentative, undemocratic and concerned with their own special 
agendas".

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Writing in a Melbourne newspaper a few weeks ago, Michael Barnard voiced 
a similar view  [15]  :Â  "We live in an ageÂ - where minority (and sometimes 
extreme) elements ... are increasingly inclined to seek the overthrow 
of domestic law through appeals to a hotpotch 'international community'".Â  
To Barnard, the problem was the "rights industry" which "either 
through manipulation or a bloated sense of mission, keeps expanding 
its horizons" threatening the autonomy of the nation state.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
It will be important for the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law to listen 
to, and answer, these critics  [16]  .Â  I know and respect Paddy McGuinness for his work as editor 
of   Quadrant,   a journal that undoubtedly 
contributes greatly to Australia's intellectual life.Â  I am aware, 
from a letter from a parishioner, that he, Philip Adams and I were recently 
included in an "unholy trinity" that a congregation was commanded 
by their priest to pray for, to save our otherwise lost souls.Â  
So we have shared prayers in common.Â  But the weakness of the opinions 
of the unidentified newspaper editorialist, Paddy McGuinness and Michael 
Barnard, is that they do not tell us what they would put in place of 
the United Nation's efforts to defend human rights on the planet.Â  
Surely, would not be more of the power of unbridled nation states, unrestrained 
by human rights law and world opinion.Â  Surely, we have made some 
progress in the twentieth century and can learn from its awful errors.Â  
Ron Castan did.Â  Jonathan Mann did.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
From my work for the United Nations in Cambodia and elsewhere, I know 
only too well that there are weaknesses in the UN system.Â  But 
the answer is to strengthen it and especially to strengthen the elements 
of law, consistency, efficiency and accountability.Â  It will probably 
never be possible to cure the "democratic deficit" by holding 
a global election for the UN Secretary-General.Â  So the only way 
the United Nations will work for us all is by our active participation 
in its human rights and other affairs.Â  By the active involvement 
of the nation states, including Australia.Â  Despite occasional 
interruptions, Australia's steady commitment to the United Nations remains 
stalwart.Â  It was signalled recently by the announcement of the 
federal government of Australia's intended ratification of the International 
Criminal Court   [17]  .Â  We are, as usual, one of the first nations to take this step.Â  
It will be followed by Australian legislation.Â  Australia remains 
a good international citizen.Â  It is helping to build a world that 
is governed by law, not brute power.Â  A world respecting fundamental 
human rights, and not condoning genocide, oppression and other abuses 
of the vulnerable and minorities.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
The strongest input into the global movement for human rights is not 
that of "unrepresentative NGOs" or "loony extremists".Â  
It is that of nation states, like Australia, that wish to learn from, 
and to help, others.Â  Input also comes from the work of strong 
professional organisations.Â  Knowledgeable or courageous NGOs and 
individuals with a commitment to human rights and the rule of law.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
This is what Ron Castan and Jonathan Mann would be saying to us in Australia 
this week as we honour their memory and commit ourselves, in these new 
institutional ways, to expanding their efforts through research and 
other work, fired by a proper sense of impatience.Â  Human rights 
is not just an idea or words.Â  For me, human rights is the nameless 
Australian soldier patiently teaching Cambodian farmers to rid the fields 
of landmines.Â  It is my last year's legal Associate, Joe Tan, working 
for the conduct of a fair election in Kosovo.Â  It is UN High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, Mary Robinson working tirelessly for the downtrodden 
and oppressed.Â  It is MsÂ Sadako Ogata, High Commissioner for 
Refugees, working for forgotten Vietnamese boat people bundled to the 
Cambodian border by Khmer who dislike them.Â  It is the Ugandan 
judge helping to establish rudimentary courts in East Timor. It is Jonathan 
Mann fighting for the voiceless against the spread of AIDS in Africa.Â  
It is Ron Castan turning his great gifts to the advantage of Australia's 
indigenous peoples.

Â

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Ron Castan's memory, and his achievements, will inspire those who follow 
in the law, including in this Centre, to strive for legal excellence 
whilst committing themselves to the building of a better Australia and 
a better world.Â
