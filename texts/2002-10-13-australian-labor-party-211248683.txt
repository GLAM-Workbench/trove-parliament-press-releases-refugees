Speaking Notes

Shadow Treasurer Bob McMullan

South Australian ALP Conference

13 October 2002 Adelaide

Labor  has  just  passed  an  important  milestone  in  the  task  of rebuilding ourselves as a credible alternative government.

Last week saw the Special Rules Conference in Canberra.

Make no mistake, that conference was crucially important.

After three straight election losses we had to change.

Our primary vote had fallen to 37.8 percent.

We simply had to make ourselves more appealing to the electorate and our members.

I think Simon Crean got it right when he said that in the Labor Party we honour our past, but we can’t live in the past.

The world had changed and we had to change too.

Simon  has  asked  me  to  thank  every  member  of  the  party  for  their contribution to that process.

The debate was passionate but never rancorous.

And now that it’s over, everyone has accepted the Party’s democratic decision.

It’s a great example of how democracy within the Party should work.

We  have  retained  our  essential  character  as  a  Labor  party.   But  we have modernised as all organisations must.

Not more conservative, but more radical - like Gough’s ALP...

There is a great precedent for what we did last week - the precedent set by Gough Whitlam.

People  forget,  but  before  Gough’s  reforms  our  party  was  ruled  by  a national conference of just 36 people and a national executive of just 12.

Neither Gough nor his deputy was represented on either body.

And they were all men.

While  the  changes  Gough  made  weren’t  huge  in  terms  of  the  rules, they were huge psychologically.

They got us focussing on government and on policies.

Many of you will remember that when Gough made his reforms to the Party, he met with strong opposition.

People said his changes would betray Labor’s principles and make us more conservative.

His opponents now admit they were wrong.

In fact, many of Gough’s most vocal critics of the time - people like the then young Philip Adams - are now among his strongest supporters.

Gough’s reforms did not betray Labor’s traditions.

They  began  a  new,  radical  and  reforming  Labor  tradition  that transformed Australia, forever.

And it won us government.

And  remember,  before  Bob  Hawke  won  government  in  1983  we reformed  again  -  doubling  the  size  of  the  national  conference  and ensuring that women had a voice.

We had to do the same again.

We now have to modernize policy…

3

We’ve modernised the Party.

Now we move on to modernise our policy.

We have to build modern Labor policies on the basis of our traditional Labor values.

This  task  is  getting  increasingly  urgent  if  we’re  going  to  stop  the Howard Government further undermining the egalitarian basis of our society.

Let  me  give  you  some  examples  of  what’s  now  happening  under  the Coalition.

We’re  working  longer,  and  harder,  for  less.   Of  all  the  advanced countries  in  the  world,  the  only  one  with  longer  working  hours  is South Korea.

Postcodes are determining who finishes school.  In the north-western suburbs  of  Melbourne,  47  percent  of  boys  leave  school  before completing year 12.  In the inner eastern suburbs it’s only 5 percent.

Our  health  system  is  being  Americanised.   The  bulk-billing  rate  for GPs has fallen from more than 90 percent to only 72 percent in just six years.

Young families are being priced out of the housing market.  In Sydney people  on  a  nurse’s  or  a  police  officer’s  wage  can’t  afford  to  buy  a family home any more.

Corporate  executives  are  getting  enormous  golden  handshakes  for leaving their firms but workers are still not guaranteed 100 percent of their redundancy entitlements.

This isn’t the sort of Australia we want.

If  our  nation  doesn’t  change  course,  we’re  in  danger  of  creating  a country we won’t be able to recognize - an unfair, unjust and unequal society in which if you can’t swim you sink.

We  need  to  develop  an  alternative  Labor  plan,  not  just  individual policies but a broader vision: Simon Crean’s plan for Australia.

Simon’s  plan,  will  be  built  on  the  idea  of  partnerships  for  nation building  -  building  partnerships  with  Australian  individuals  and organisations to get Australians to work together to build a modern 21st Century Australia.

The contrast between the complacent ‘out-of-puff’ Howard Government and  the  Crean  alternative  keen  to  invest  in  the  future  of  Australians and Australia is a very important contrast we need to establish.

Some important policy contrasts are clear already.  But they have not been recognised.  We need to turn our attention now to publicising the changes  we  have  made  and  building  on  them  with  further  and  more detailed proposals.

There  is  a  contrast  over  paid  maternity  leave.   A  Crean  Labor Government  would  be  unequivocally  committed  to  the  introduction  of paid maternity leave.  It is impossible to work out whether the Howard Government  thinks  paid  maternity  leave  is  a  worthwhile  option  or middle-class welfare that will only be introduced over their dead body.

There is a contrast over employee entitlements.  Under a Crean Labor Government, Australian workers would be guaranteed 100 per cent of their  legitimate  entitlements  -  not  left  millions  short  like  the  Ansett workers who still haven’t got their full redundancy entitlements.

There  is  a  contrast  over  Telstra.   The  Howard  Government’s  only agenda is to fatten Telstra’s profits to maximise its sale price.  We have a  clear  alternative  policy  to  develop  a  modern  efficient

telecommunications company in majority public ownership.

There is a contrast over the environment.  A Crean Labor Government will ratify the Kyoto Protocol but a Howard Government won’t.  This is not  just  important  in  our  role  as  responsible  international  citizens focussing on the global need to combat global warming, it is important to  Australia.   It  is  important  because  global  warming  makes  this  hot dry  continent  hotter  and  dryer  and  even  more  vulnerable  to  drought. But  it  is  also  economically  important.   There  are  new  industries,  and new opportunities for existing industries, which will be denied to us if we are not parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

And  there  has  been  a  contrast  over  asylum  seekers.   As  long  ago  as January we announced that: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we wanted children and their mothers out from behind the razor wire,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we wanted Woomera closed, Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we wanted greater public scrutiny of detention centres, Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we  wanted  detention  centres  returned  to  public  management, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we wanted the Pacific Solution ended.

Further  policy  will  be  announced  in  the  not  too  distant  future  -  with input  from  party  members.   But  there  is  already  a  clear  difference between Labor and the Coalition.  We believe in protecting our borders but  we  want  asylum  seekers  treated  with  greater  compassion.   Bill

Clinton made the point to the British Labour Party conference last week that centre-left parties have to combine strength and compassion if we are to avoid being misrepresented by our opponents through scurrilous political wedge campaigns.  It’s a good speech and I urge you to read it.

So, much has been done on policy but there is much more to do.  For example, we need to invest in the nation and its people - we need to re-establish  our  commitment  to  creating  a  knowledge  society.   The individual policies from the last election need updating to meet the new challenges  but  the  thrust  of  them  will  remain.   There  is  simply  no alternative if we want to create jobs for this generation and the next:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Better schools; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Better TAFEs and universities; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ More research and development; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  creation  of  new  industries  and  the  regeneration  of  existing

industries; and, Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Making us a world leader in sustainable technology.

This investment is necessary to create new industries but it is also vital to the future of our existing industries.

An  important  article  earlier  this  week  in  the  Melbourne  Age  by  Tim Colebatch set out the economic problem facing Australia.

We’ve simply stopped investing in the industries that will create jobs in the future.

Look at manufacturing.

Manufacturing output has grown by an average of only 2.5 per cent a year under the Howard Government - only half the rate of GDP.

Only 1.1 percent of GDP was invested in manufacturing.  It was 2.1 percent when we were last in power.

Manufacturing exports have risen by just 7 per cent a year under the Howard Government.  Over our last 10 years in office the average was 15 per cent a year.  As a result, our manufacturing trade deficit has now reached a staggering $63 billion.

Think  of  all  the  jobs  that  have  been  lost  and  jobs  that  haven’t  been created.

This is what Tim Colebatch concluded:

“The weakness of Australian industry today is a direct consequence of the Howard Government’s cuts to a wide range of support programs, from  R&D  support  to  production  bounties,  training  programs  and

6

export development grants.  Labor made mistakes in office, but this is one area where it can stand tall.”

Colebatch  is  right.   Everyone  knows  that  to  build  a  bridge  to  the future you have to invest.

If you want to know the key difference between Labor and the Liberals it’s this - they only believe in cutting; we will invest.

The debt and housing crisis

Australia also needs new policies to confront existing crises.

It has been clear for some time that Australia faces a serious problem with  the  explosion  of  household  debt  and  the  related  problem  of  the housing  bubble,  which  will  have  serious  consequences  for  Australia and Australians when it bursts.

The Government has been truly negligent in this area.  It has taken its well-known complacency to a new order of magnitude.

Despite warnings from the Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Government has spent months in denial.  It still remains the only major western country without a national policy on  housing  and  urban  development.   Mark  Latham  has  been articulating  some  important  alternative  policies  for  Labor  in  this  area aimed at promoting affordability and improving urban development.

It is clear that the Howard Government won’t act in a positive way on the issues of housing and urban planning.

Mounting evidence of an overheated housing market raises important questions  about  the  practices  of  lenders  and  regulatory  authorities. The combined effects of rapid rises in house prices and record levels of household debt have left many Australian families vulnerable.

I urge Treasurer Peter Costello urgently to call a meeting of financial institutions and regulatory authorities involved with home lending.

Home-buyers  who  have  borrowed  heavily  relative  to  their  income, often  close  to  the  full  value  of  the  property,  will  be  particularly vulnerable if prices fall, or if interest rates rise further.

The Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have  given  repeated  warnings  to  borrowers  and  lenders  to  exercise caution.  But  Mr  Costello  has  until  recently  been  oblivious.   Even where he has finally been prepared to act, in an overdue recognition of at least part of the problem, it is too little and too late.  He has failed

7

to  recognise  there  is  a  household  debt  problem,  and  has  made  no consistent response to the risks of the housing bubble.

Responsible  proactive  economic  managers  should  attempt  to anticipate imbalances before they develop into major problems. This is not easy, but experience has demonstrated that such imbalances can have painful consequences once the inevitable correction eventuates.

Rather  than  passively  sitting  on  the  sidelines  the  Government  has  a number of options at its disposal. APRA has given a timely warning to the  Government  about  the  housing  sector.  It  now  rests  on  the Treasurer to show some leadership and take control of the process by calling  a  meeting  to  carefully  review  guidelines  for  lenders,  to  review regulatory  arrangements  and  standards,  and  to  insist  that  lenders follow suitably prudent policies.

He  should  institute  a  two-stage  review  of  prudential  standards  and constraints on housing affordability.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  first  stage  would  involve  an  immediate  review  of  lending practices  to  ascertain  the  extent  of  any  problems  and  whether any immediate action can be taken.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  second  stage  would  involve  a  more  thorough  appraisal  of regulatory  practices  to  ensure  they  are  both  rigorous  and comprehensive.  This  should  extend  to  broader  policies  to promote  affordable  housing,  such  as  those  canvassed  by  Mark Latham.

The  meeting  should  be  chaired  by  the  Treasurer  and  include representatives of:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Reserve Bank of Australia Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Treasury Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Banks,  building  societies,  credit  unions  and  mortgage  brokers

involved in home lending Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Industry  associations  representing  banks,  building  societies, credit unions, mortgage brokers, housing and real estate bodies

and consumer groups.

From  this  vantage  point  the  full  impact  and  extent  of  the  bubble cannot  be  judged,  but  considering  the  dangers,  the  government should be addressing the problem much more energetically.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve wrote to banks as long ago as  October  1999  urging  them  to  take  a  more  cautious  approach  to lending  for  housing.   Lenders  were  required  to  implement  risk management programs to identify, measure, monitor and control the risks inherent in loans with a high ‘loan-to-value’. Lenders were also

8

required  to  ensure  loans  equal  to  or  more  than  90  per  cent  of  the value  of  the  property  had  appropriate  credit  support  --  such  as mortgage insurance, readily marketable collateral or other acceptable collateral.

If it is good enough for Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to be imposing such  requirements,  Peter  Costello  should  be  prepared  to  consider them too.

Conclusion

The  sad  irony  is,  despite  all  the  cuts  to  our  services  and  despite  the Government’s  complacency,  Australians  are  paying  higher  taxes  than ever before.

When  Labor  left  office,  the  Commonwealth  Government  raised  23  per cent of GDP in tax - today it is 24.9 per cent.

The Government claims that taxes are still only 23 per cent but that is because they conveniently don’t include the GST.

This is a tax imposed by the Federal Parliament.  It has been defined by the  Bureau  of  Statistics  and  the  Auditor-General  to  be  clearly  and unequivocally  a  Commonwealth  tax.   When  that  is  included,  the Commonwealth’s taxation revenue is 24.9 per cent of GDP.  And yet the Howard  Government  has  to  find  new  taxes  to  meet  every  contingency that  arises.   There  is  no  problem  too  big  or  too  small  for  the  Howard Government  to  see  it  as  an  opportunity  for  a  new  tax.   We  have  an Ansett  tax,  a  dairy  tax,  a  sugar  tax,  a  medical  indemnity  tax,  a proposition for a tourism tax and now they want a war tax.  And just this  week  we  have  learnt  that  the  Government  wants  to  revisit  its proposal to increase the price of essential medicines.  It is just another unfair tax designed to fill the budget hole they have created.

This  is  a  Government  of  drift  and  complacency,  just  like  the  Menzies Government  in  its  later  years.  The  Menzies  era  was  brought  to  a crushing  halt  by  Labor  under  Gough  Whitlam.   First  he  reformed  the Party  then  he  outlined  his  new  policy  program.  This  led  to  the  end  of the  drift  and  complacency  of  the  Menzies  era.    We  need  to  do  it  all again.  We have the Party structure right. Now we need to get the policy right. Then we can bring the drift and complacency of the Howard era to an end.
