E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony, good to talk to you again.

TONY ABBOTT:

Nice to be with you, Steve.

STEVE VIZARD:

Ever followed Placido Domingo before?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the short answer is a bit. I mean, he does have a fabulous voice and I wish I could sing like that, but I  do have tickets on myself when it comes to karaoke but IÃ¢ÂÂd never try to sing Nessun Dorma. Never.

STEVE VIZARD:

YouÃ¢ÂÂre not a shower singer?

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm afraid if I stayed in the shower I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt get myself into trouble but sometimes I venture forth onto the  karaoke floor.

STEVE VIZARD:

I want to talk about the “Malaysian solution”. In todayÃ¢ÂÂs Newspoll, 78 per cent of respondents basically  ranked LaborÃ¢ÂÂs handling of the asylum seekers issue as bad, yet Immigration Minister Chris Bowen still  believes the “Malaysian solution” is innovative and that he is proud of it. How do you reconcile those two  propositions?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that it was always a bad deal. I mean, the idea that they would take 800 of ours and we would  take 4,000 of theirs was probably a good deal for Malaysia but it was a terrible deal for Australia, and the  fact that we had something like 12 boats and 400 people or thereabouts after the announcement suggested  that it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt going to work. So, I just think it was a bad deal and only a Government which had a whole lot  of failures under its belt, only a Government that was desperate not to admit that John Howard essentially  had it right and therefore had an “anywhere but Nauru” policy wouldÃ¢ÂÂve come up with the Malaysian deal.

STEVE VIZARD:

Chris Bowen apparently has offered to resign over this. That presumably was rejected. Should Julia Gillard  have accepted his resignation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, itÃ¢ÂÂs Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs policy. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not Chris BowenÃ¢ÂÂs policy, and if thereÃ¢ÂÂs anyone who should be  resigning over this disaster itÃ¢ÂÂs the Prime Minister herself. As IÃ¢ÂÂve said quite a bit lately, I think that this  Government has failed. I think that this Government is attempting to sneak through the parliament policies,  very important policies for which it has no mandate and IÃ¢ÂÂve said time and time again that it should take  these policies to an election, so really thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I think would be good - Julia Gillard saying, Ã¢ÂÂlook, letÃ¢ÂÂs  go to the polls and resolve all of thisÃ¢ÂÂ. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think itÃ¢ÂÂs going to happen. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I think an  honourable Prime Minister would be doing.

STEVE VIZARD:

The Government asserts that while the High Court might have basically scuttled the “Malaysian solution”,  itÃ¢ÂÂs also removed effectively you favoured option, Nauru. HereÃ¢ÂÂs what Chris Bowen had to say on that  matter in relation to Nauru just a little while ago. No, we havenÃ¢ÂÂt got that. But he basically said that heÃ¢ÂÂs  received advice from the Solicitor-General saying that Nauru is not an option and that advice has been  further backed up by QCs such as Ron Merkel and other experts. Can I get your response to whether you  believe Nauru is still viable?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think heÃ¢ÂÂs wrong. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think that the Solicitor-GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs advice does anything like that. Yes, itÃ¢ÂÂs  plain that the High Court does expect people who are sent to a third country for processing to be treated  appropriately but the interesting thing about Nauru is that it essentially has the same legal system as  Australia and youÃ¢ÂÂve got two senior Australian judges on the Nauruan Supreme Court and youÃ¢ÂÂve got the  High Court of Australia as the ultimate court of appeal for Nauru, so this idea that Nauru is some kind of a  tin pot third world country where no standards of justice apply is just dead wrong. So, I make that point  Steve, but the other point I make is that if the Government believes that it does have a problem with third  country processing, the Coalition is prepared to work constructively with the Government to amend the  Migration Act, to remove any impediments that the Government thinks there might be for third country  processing. So this is a good faith offer by the Coalition. We think the ball is now in the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs  court. SheÃ¢ÂÂs been saying for months that the only way to stop the boats is to have third country processing.  Well, this is her chance to resurrect something from the ruins of her border protection policy.

STEVE VIZARD:

What conditions would you put on your support for an amendment to the Migration Act to get, basically, to  get Nauru up? Would you bring back temporary protection visas? Would you want certain requirements

about turning back the boats? What specific, additional conditions would you seek to support the  Government on this one?

TONY ABBOTT:

Steve, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a difference between what we would do if we were in government and what weÃ¢ÂÂre offering the  Government now. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not saying that the Government has to accept all elements of the CoalitionÃ¢ÂÂs policy.  WeÃ¢ÂÂre saying if they want to do third country offshore processing and if they think the Migration Act is  deficient in the light of the High CourtÃ¢ÂÂs decision, we will help them to correct the Act. We will help them to  amend the Act. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂre saying. WeÃ¢ÂÂre not saying that theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to have temporary protection  visas, weÃ¢ÂÂre not saying that theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to be prepared to turn around boats; we would do those things if we  were in government. Our policy hasnÃ¢ÂÂt changed and wonÃ¢ÂÂt change but weÃ¢ÂÂre saying now we will help the  Government to resurrect what it said was its policy, namely third country processing by amending the  Migration Act if thatÃ¢ÂÂs what they think is necessary for their policies to go ahead.

STEVE VIZARD:

And if they donÃ¢ÂÂt accept your basically minimum position, that is no further requirements than those  requirements the Government itself sees are necessary, to amend the Migration Act and get Nauru up, if they  donÃ¢ÂÂt progress that, whatÃ¢ÂÂs your view about that Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Steve, if theyÃ¢ÂÂre not prepared to accept this good faith offer it would show that the Prime Minister was  never fair dinkum in the first place and that basically sheÃ¢ÂÂs now completely caved in to the Greens and the  Left and I think that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to understand Steve that weÃ¢ÂÂve got a serious border protection problem. On  the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs watch weÃ¢ÂÂve had something like 240 boats and more than 12, 000 illegal boat arrivals.  WeÃ¢ÂÂve had something like 100 boats and 5,000 arrivals since the Prime Minister became Prime Minister. So  theyÃ¢ÂÂve got a disaster on our doorstep and itÃ¢ÂÂs all their own doing, and IÃ¢ÂÂm saying that now that their policy  has collapsed into ruins I am prepared to be constructive and give them the legislative cure that they now say  is necessary for their policy of third country processing.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony, given that Australia is now in limbo we donÃ¢ÂÂt have an effective policy in place at the moment, weÃ¢ÂÂve  got legal advice flying around left right and centre but no effective policy in place and every day that goes  by the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs authority diminishes, what time frame do you put on the Prime Minister either  accepting or rejecting your offer as being reasonable?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be too prescriptive here. IÃ¢ÂÂm saying that IÃ¢ÂÂm prepared to be helpful and if she  wants to give herself a policy, if she wants to give herself the opportunity to continue with PNG and to look  at Nauru, well, weÃ¢ÂÂre waiting to help. WeÃ¢ÂÂre waiting to help. Now, weÃ¢ÂÂre waiting to help today and weÃ¢ÂÂre  waiting to help next week. WeÃ¢ÂÂre here to help on this because Australia needs strong border protection. I  think this Government has been absolutely hopeless at delivering it but I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the border protection  situation to remain hopeless because of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs problems. So IÃ¢ÂÂm here to help, Steve, and, look, if  they decide that they want our help next week thatÃ¢ÂÂs great. If they decide that they want our help the week  after, thatÃ¢ÂÂs great. WeÃ¢ÂÂre here to try to ensure that the Government doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have parliament as an excuse for  its inability to protect its borders.

STEVE VIZARD:

And finally Tony, is the person youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be helping Julia Gillard or Kevin Rudd?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again, letÃ¢ÂÂs wait and see what happens inside the Labor Party. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of unhappiness with Julia  Gillard but I think Steve the problem is not the leader. The problem is the policy or the lack of policy or the  policy-making processes and I say, as IÃ¢ÂÂve been saying all along, that the best way to change the policy is to  change the government not to just change the leader. But look, letÃ¢ÂÂs see what emerges. As I say, the Prime  Minister is in all sorts of trouble in her own caucus. I am trying to give her a way forward on border  protection and I hope sheÃ¢ÂÂs a big enough person to take it up.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony Abbott, good to talk to you as always.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much Steve.
