Greens say Labor, Liberal must move on broad range of  issues

27th Jun 04

The Australian Greens say that both Labor and the Coalition are a long way

from attracting Greens voters’ preferences on a broad range of issues.



The Greens are holding a National Council meeting in Brisbane.



“Both the old parties are travelling badly for voters who think there is much

more to nation-building than pre-election handouts,” Greens Senator Bob

Brown said today.



“We will be judging both parties on litmus-test issues where their policies are

yet to be announced. These include:



Saving Tasmania’s iconic forests and wildlife;

Increased funding for public health, education and housing;

Abolition of the Private Health Insurance Rebate to fund public health;

Removing the 10% GST on public transport, and;

A just settlement on East Timor’s oil and gas reserves.



"We are assessing all policies and, in recent weeks, have seen both parties

lining up to slam an extra 21% on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme scripts

for families, and to legislate against same-sex marriages, and vote for the US-

Australia Free Trade Agreement.



"We are assessing the parties’ announced or unfolding policies compared to

the Greens’ aim for:



Ã¢ÂÂ     The Kyoto Protocol and need to increase the Mandatory Renewable

Energy Target to 10% by 2010 and to 20% by 2020;

Ã¢ÂÂ     3,000 gigalitres per annum to be returned to the Murray-Darling;

Ã¢ÂÂ     Abolition of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme;

Ã¢ÂÂ     Bringing Australia’s troops home from Iraq, and;

Ã¢ÂÂ     An end to mandatory detention of asylum seekers.

"On forests, the Greens policy is protection of all Australia’s remaining old

growth forests and their wildlife. The litmus test is the immediate protection

of Tasmania’s iconic forests, including the Tarkine forests, StyxRiver‘Valley of

the Giants’, and the Blue Tier.



“We will be releasing a raft of new policies in the run to the election and

evaluating the Labor and Liberal policies when it comes to deciding whether

to direct preferences in House of Representative seats across the nation,”

Senator Brown said.



“That decision is made by electorate groups at local level who will also be

assessing local and regional issues. For example, in Queensland, the future

of Cape York is very important.”
