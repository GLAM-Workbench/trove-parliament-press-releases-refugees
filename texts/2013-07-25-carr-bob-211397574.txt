AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE FOR SYRIA REACHES $100 MILLION

Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, and Minister for International  Development, Melissa Parke MP, today announced a further $21.5 million in  humanitarian assistance for people affected by the deteriorating situation in Syria.

This brings Australia’s total humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis in Syria  to $100 million since June 2011.  Australia remains one of the top ten donors to  those in need in Syria and regional countries hosting Syrian refugees.

“Violence and human suffering continue unabated in Syria with over 93 000 killed  and 6.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance,” Minister Carr said.

The impact on the region is grave and 1.8 million refugees, mostly women and  children, have already fled Syria.  A refugee exodus of this size has not been seen  since the Rwandan genocide almost 20 years ago.

“Many vulnerable people need urgent help,” said Minister Parke. “This additional  Australian assistance will benefit people inside Syria and also those who have fled to  neighbouring countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.”

Inside Syria, Australia’s new contribution will help United Nations organisations  deliver desperately needed basic services.

Ã¯Â£Â§ $5 million to World Food Programme will help maintain emergency food  supplies to  three million people;   Ã¯Â£Â§ $3 million to World Health Organisation will help address critical shortages in  medical supplies;   Ã¯Â£Â§ $3 million to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) will help ensure drinking water is

safe and 2.5 million children are vaccinated; and  Ã¯Â£Â§ $1 million to the UN Population Fund will help provide reproductive health care  and psycho-social support for over 1 million vulnerable women and children.



“The crisis is destabilising the region.  Our contribution will help ease the suffering  and go some way to reduce the burden of sheltering these refugees,” Minister Carr  said.

Ã¯Â£Â§ $5 million to the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) will help protect and shelter  one million refugees in Jordan and Lebanon;    Ã¯Â£Â§ $4 million to Australian NGOs will help their lifesaving work among Syrian  refugees;    Ã¯Â£Â§ $0.5m will support the deployment of Australian expertise in aid coordination.

Minister Parke also appealed to Australians to continue to support the work of  accredited Australian NGOs in direct donations. “Australian NGOs are doing  magnificent work supporting the victims affected by the Syrian conflict. Additional  funding from the Australia government is our contribution to these efforts”.
