PRESS RELEASE ,

.  r . FROM: DR MOSS CASS, MP, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC.Â·  AFFAIRS . . .  .... ....  .....  "........................... "Discussions in Geneva between the Government of Vietnam., countries of

first asylum and developed countries to try to find a solution 'to the .   refugee problem confirms the foresight and understanding of the Labor  Ministers and Shadow Ministers,," Dr Cass said.

The recent Federal Conference of tbe A.L.P. endorsed the call by the

Labor spokesmen on Immigration and Community Affairs in December,last

for a conference of the rich developed countries of the world, Vietnam

and countries carrying the major burden of the refugee problem.

"Liberal spokesmen have criticised us for arguing for the development

of a closer relationship between the Governments of Vietnam and

the affluent nations of the world. The Labor Party has repeatedly .   emphasised the need for realistic aid for Vietnam to ease the economic

pressures of people to leave, coupled with pressure on Vietnam to stop  any political victimisation forcing people to become refugees," Dr Cass said.

"Unlike the fruitless discussions in Geneva last year, which concentrated  on destructive criticism of Vietnam and mutual recriminations by the

affluent nations, the present conference is acting in accord with  Labor proposals.  The constructive discussions have led. to a reduction

in the flow of refugees from Vietnam and positive offers of aid to  Vietnam which will reduce its dependence on the Soviet Union," Dr Cass  observed.  .  '  .

"Clearly it is in the best interests of all the non-communist nations

for Vietnam to be independent and not part of the Russian power bloc,  or the Chinese power bloc," Dr Cass asserted.  .

Economic independence is the best, guarantee of political independence

and in view of the economic difficulties admitted to by. the Vietnamese

Governmentonly economic aid from affluent non-communist nations will

assist freedom from Chinese or Russian domination. .  ... .... .J __________ ____ _________ ___________ ______
