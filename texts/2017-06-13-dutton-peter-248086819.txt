E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

LEON BYNER:

Now, some weeks back Bill Shorten was in the studio and I took the opportunity of  canvassing with him - and remember this is in the environment where the  Immigration Minister wants more power to deport people - and the question came up  such as this:

[excerpt]

LEON BYNER:

We've got six people who we allowed in from Iran believing they were refugees.  We've now found that they're not genuine refugees and it's gone to the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal and they said; no, they can stay. What's your view  on this?

BILL SHORTEN:

I don't understand how that decision could be made. I mean, I don't know all the  facts, that's just what I've read in the paper, but if they're not genuine refugees then  they shouldn't be allowed here as refugees. There's enough genuine refugees in the  world that we don't need some fake refugees…

LEON BYNER:

…absolutely…

BILL SHORTEN:

…if that is in fact what's happened...

LEON BYNER:

Okay. Should we deport them?

BILL SHORTEN:

If that is in fact what's happened then I think the Minister needs to explain what steps  he's going to take.

[end of excerpt]

LEON BYNER:

Now, that's precisely what's going to happen, but there is doubt as to whether Labor  will support what the Government want to do. We caught up with Peter Dutton not  long ago.



Minister, you're looking for more powers, not just with visas, but with citizenship. Can  you explain to the people of SA what it is you want to do and what hurdles there are  stopping you from doing it?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Leon, the Government's determined to make sure that we can really modernise  our citizenship programme so the vast majority of people who apply for citizenship  are good law-abiding people, they'll work hard, they'll educate their children and  they'll be great Australians. We want to make sure though that everybody is in that  category and so we're saying that we want to extend the period of permanent  residency from one year to four years - bearing in mind that Canada's five years and  Germany for example is eight years - so we want people to have that four years of  permanent residency before they can apply to become a citizen. It allows us to have  a look at people's histories whilst they've been here; if they're of working age, have  they been involved in employment? If there are kids are of school age, have their  kids been enrolled at school? So it is about, not only abiding by Australian laws, but  also adhering to Australian values. So that's the principle of this modernisation.

There's an anomaly in the law as it exists at the moment so the Immigration Minister  of the day, at the moment, when it comes to a visa application can deny that visa  and the person can appeal that to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT can  decide to reinstate that visa and under the current law, the Minister can then  substitute a new decision - so that is overrule the AAT - but there's an anomaly in  the law where that can't apply to people making application for citizenship. So we've  had some recent examples where a person who had been convicted of sexual  offences against children had made application to become a citizen; the Delegate of  the Minister decided that that application would be refused; the person went to the  AAT and the AAT said; no, the person can apply for citizenship and in that  circumstance the Minister had no power to overrule it.

So it's really aligning the arrangement that we currently have with visas - which has  existed under both Liberal and Labor Governments for a long period of time - so that  we can apply that same common sense to citizenship applications as well.

LEON BYNER:

What about your right as Minister to deport people who have breached their  conditions, have committed serious offences and then the Tribunal says; well, they  can stay?

PETER DUTTON:

Well this is a very important question. So we've seen that cases recently where six  Iranians who had arrived by boat, the Delegate within the Department - one of my  Delegates - had made a decision that those visas should be cancelled because they  claimed to be fleeing persecution from Iran and yet they'd gone back on holidays to  Iran on a number of occasions. Those cases went to the AAT and the AAT decided  that those visas should be reinstated.

Now, I had a look at each of those individual cases and I decided that the visas  should be cancelled.

So, as I say, you can apply the common sense now when it comes to visas, but  when it comes to applications for Australian citizenship, the law is deficient at the  moment and that's why we've proposed to change it.

LEON BYNER:

Are you getting the feeling that Labor will assist you here?

PETER DUTTON:

Sadly I'm not. I said yesterday that I thought it was a really important point of  bipartisanship required here and I called on Mr Shorten to do that. Unfortunately it  seems the Labor Party is divided on it; the Left of the Party is not supportive of the  additional English language requirements that we would want. It seems that they're  out there again today, Tony Burke, their spokesperson on citizenship matters is out  there talking a different message. Mr Shorten says, in principle, he supports it, but  I'm just not sure that adds up to support in the Parliament and if we can't get it  through the Senate then…I think it's incumbent upon the Labor Party, frankly, to  support it in the Senate because if we don't I just think we don't recognise the  modern reality when we've got people applying for citizenship and we need to deal  with the current arrangement as it presents, the current threat as it presents and I  think Australian citizenship should be preserved for the vast majority of people who  are doing the right thing.

LEON BYNER:

Is what you're looking for, via the Parliament, any different to what most of our equal  style nations do? Is there any difference?

PETER DUTTON:

No. In fact some countries, comparable countries are harder, tougher in their  approach than what Australia has been and I've said for a while that I've been  concerned about the citizenship pathway because I think essentially it's been  reduced down to a tick and flick exercise; people are permanent residents, they tick  the boxes and citizenship flows as a result of that.

As we're seeing at the moment, Leon - and you and I have had the discussion  before - where people say; well, why are we allowing foreign fighters back into our  country? Well the fact is that some of those people have been conferred with  Australian citizenship and once somebody moves from being a non-resident or a  visa holder to becoming an Australian citizen, they have the protection of all of the  laws, of the constitution, they have rights to welfare, to health and education etc. and  I would judge - and I'm sure most Australians would judge - that if people are off as  foreign fighters fighting in Syria at the moment and they had been conferred with  Australian citizenship, that that wasn't the right outcome, that they shouldn’t have  become citizens.

So there are a number of reasons why we want to update these laws, modernise  these laws and I hope that Mr Shorten can see his way clear to support them.

LEON BYNER:

Well that's the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton not long ago.
