Continuation of Australia's Temporary  Presence in Nauru

The Government will provide $1.7 million to continue Australiaâ€™s  diplomatic presence in Nauru for a further year, to support and  facilitate the work of Australian Government agencies in  processing asylum seekers.

The Consulate-General provides a central point of contact for  official dealings with Nauru and is necessary for the smooth  functioning of the facilities.

Processing of asylum seekers, the resettlement of refugees and  the repatriation of those found not to be refugees have taken  longer than expected owing to factors such as the campaign  against terrorism and hostilities in Iraq.

DFAT established an Australian Administrative Centre on Nauru in  September 2001, and in the 2002-03 Budget, DFAT received  funding to maintain a Consulate-General for one year.
