HMAS MELBOURNE RESCUES REFUGEES

"Australia accepts responsibility for the resettlement of

about 100 refugees rescued at sea by HMAS Melbourne in the

South China Sea last night," the Acting Minister for Immigration

and Ethnic Affairs,  Senator Peter Durack,  said today.

Senator Durack was commenting on a Defence Department statement

which gave details of the rescue by HMAS Melbourne of a group ,

of Indo-Chinese refugees in waters east of Ho Chi Minh City.

"The provision of guarantees for refugees groups such as

these is an accepted international practice. Under these .

arrangements the country bearing the flag of the vessel .

involved offers a guarantee for the resettlement of all refugees

in the group not resettled by other governments. This means that

countries which may be asked to provide transit facilities will

not be left with the problem," Senator Durack said.

The Singapore authorities will be approached for their "

agreement to land the refugees pending their resettlement under

the guarantee arrangement. . .  .
