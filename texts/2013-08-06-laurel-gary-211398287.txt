PRESENTER:

He could be the next Prime Minister of Australia, we do have to wait until September 7th, of course, he was  in beautiful Ipswich yesterday, your home town, handy Gary, Mr Tony Abbott, good morning!

TONY ABBOTT:

Laurel, it’s lovely to be with you.

PRESENTER:

Can we sort of start with where you were yesterday - in our local area, but Ipswich in particular at a meat  processing plant - very much heartland of Labor.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, but I think it’s an area which is very much looking to do better and they are looking at the Coalition  and they’re thinking that under the Coalition you lose the carbon tax, you lose the mining tax, we’ll actually  get cracking with some of the important infrastructure that Queensland and Brisbane needs, we’ll get the red  tape off business so that should create more jobs and I don’t think anyone, Laurel, really wants another three  years like the last six.

PRESENTER:

And it’s not just you and Mr Rudd of course, how important do you think the minority parties will be this  election and would you lead a minority government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting you should ask that question because I think Australians are sick of a hung parliament,  I think they’re sick of minority government, and no, if it’s another hung parliament I’ll leave it to the Labor  Party but Mr Rudd is already saying yes, he will sit down and negotiate deals with the Greens even though

just a few months ago in his book the Treasurer, Mr Bowen, was telling us that doing deals with the Greens  has helped to very badly damage, perhaps even fatally damage the Labor Party because if you sit down and  start doing deals with the Greens, who do you represent? What do you believe? What’s happened to the  heart and soul of the Labor Party under those circumstances?

PRESENTER:

The Prime Minister has been making a big deal about Liberal Party funding coming from tobacco  companies, this morning actually here in Brisbane he’s raised it again… is this true?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my understanding is that we have accepted some donations over the years from tobacco companies  but people donate to us just as all sorts of dodgy people in some people’s eyes donate to the Labor Party  including some pretty dodgy unions but the important point is that no one owns the Liberal Party and when I  was the Health Minister I put policies in place such as the graphic health warnings on cigarette packs which  produced a significant decline in smoking rates.

PRESENTER:

What will your government do to stop the cruel world of smuggling?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Laurel, we’ll do again what we did before which did actually stop the boats, never forget that the last  Coalition Government did stop the boats, the current Government under Mr Rudd started them up again it  was Mr Rudd who gave the people smugglers back their business model. Now yes, he announced about two  weeks ago with great fanfare this deal with PNG. The deal didn’t stop the boats, almost certainly in the next  24 or 48 hours we’ll get our 50,000th illegal arrival by boat and interestingly we discovered today that the  deal hadn’t actually been signed - it’s not a done deal and with each passing day it seems that its  unravelling. He told us that every single illegal arrival would go to PNG, but now he tells us that he’s  building new detention centres in Darwin and in country New South Wales to take them so what all this  means, Laurel, is that you can’t trust what Mr Rudd says.

PRESENTER:

Mr Rudd also said when he launched the election date that this would be a dirty, negative campaign coming  from the Liberal Party, is this going to be the case?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you might have seen our advertisements last night and I think they’re very positive advertisements.  They’re about how our country can be better, they’re about hope, reward and opportunity, they’re about  building a stronger and more prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. But inevitably, Mr Rudd  can’t run away from his record. Mr Rudd can’t hide from the pink batts, from the overpriced school halls,  from the boat people disaster that he was responsible for and that’s not being dirty - that’s just being truthful  to talk about that.

PRESENTER:

I think one thing that Australians have always been very nervous about and that is that the selling up of our  country something like 4.6 million hectares of aussie land is now foreign owned. Shouldn’t Australia  seriously be the fruit bowl of our whole area including Asia, I mean more and more farmers are walking off

their land every day - it’s very frustrating - I don’t understand it, I don’t understand why we aren’t  manufacturing more food instead of taking cheaper imports.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think you, in a sense, told us why, Laurel, when you said ‘cheaper.’ Why do the consumers of Australia  buy the foreign product as opposed to the domestic one? Well, sometimes because they think the quality’s  ok and the price is better. I certainly want to see Australia as the food bowl to Asia, I certainly want to see  ever stronger agricultural industries, I think agriculture should be a very strong part of a five pillar economy  - I really do believe that. But we’ve got to make it easier for our agriculture to compete and taking off the  carbon tax, getting red tape down, green tape down - that’s very important if we’re going to flourish as an  agricultural producer and that’s what I really want to see happen.

PRESENTER:

Well, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, thank you for joining us this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Laurel, Gary and Mark it’s great to be with you and I just want to say that I think our best days as a nation  are ahead of us, but I do think that better days will start with changing the government on September 7th.
