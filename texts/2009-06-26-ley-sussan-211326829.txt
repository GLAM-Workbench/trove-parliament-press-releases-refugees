The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs



26 June 2009

MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release

Border Protection stretched by Rudd policy

Kevin Rudd and Labor’s bungled approach to border protection is stretching the Australian  Customs and Border Protection Service beyond capacity, Shadow Customs and Justice  Minister Sussan Ley said today.

The Australian reported today that Customs Border Protection Command is on high alert for  more than 100 unauthorised arrivals, understood to be en route to Australia, after having left  from Indonesia.

Only days ago a boat carrying 49 asylum seekers and four crew was intercepted just six  kilometres southeast of Ashmore reef, making it the 14th boat to arrive this year.

“Customs and Border Protection has finite resources, which it is now forced to deploy in this  one pocket of ocean, all because of Labor’s changed asylum seeker policy,” Ms Ley said.

She said Customs was doing a remarkable job considering the limited resources they had,  comprising the contracted ACV Triton, the ageing Customs Bay Class vessels and  contracted surveillance aircraft.

“Thankfully our Navy is on hand to help interdict and take on board these large numbers of  unauthorised arrivals because Customs has simply not been provided with the necessary  assets by the Rudd Government.

“With the rate of boatpeople arriving, it is impossible for Customs and Border Protection to  continue to mop up the Rudd Labor Government’s policy mess,” Ms Ley said.

“The Christmas Island immigration facility is near capacity and the Government has no  contingency plan with more asylum seekers expected to set sail with the green light of  Labor’s softened asylum seeker strategy.

“The Government should either reverse its grave policy mistake or reverse its budget cuts to  Customs” Ms Ley said.
