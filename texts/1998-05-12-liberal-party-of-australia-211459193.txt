EXTRA $12.6 MILLION TO SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED 
YOUNG AUSTRALIANS

Â

The Federal Government will provide an extra $12.6 million in the 
next four y ears to assist disadvantaged young Australians to 
improve their education, skills and job prospects, the Minister for 
Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp, announced 
today.

Â

The funding is for the Job Placement, Employment and 
Training (JPET) programme to help young people overcome problems that 
are preventing them from participating successfully at school or in 
training or in the employment market.

Â

A total of $14.3 million will be provided under this 
programme in 1998-99. The increased funding will create an extra 2,200 
participant places in 1998-99. The total number of participant places 
in 1998-99 will be 10,500.

Â

The funding was announced as part of the Federal Government’s 
Budget.

Â

“JPET assists young people aged 15-21 who are homeless 
or at risk of becoming homeless, as well as young people in this age 
group who are refugees, who have been involved with the juvenile justice 
system and who are or have been wards of the State.

Â

The programme provides assistance to help these young 
people overcome problems such as drug and alcohol abuse, family conflict, 
a history of sexual or other abuse, and literacy and numeracy difficulties. 
JPET services focus on these underlying problems as well as helping 
young people seek work or re-enter education.

Â

“JPET assistance will make a real, long-term difference 
to the lives of thousands of young people,” Dr Kemp said.

Â

“Of the 1998-99 funds, $2.6 million will be reserved 
to assist young people who are eligible for JPET and who are affected 
by the Mutual Obligation requirements. These young people need specialised 
intensive assistance to help them participate fully in the life of the 
community.”

Â

The JPET programme was re-established in 1996 to fulfil 
a commitment made in the Coalition policy document,   Pathways to Real Jobs.  About 8,300 young people have already 
received assistance through the programme.

Â

JPET-funded activities have included improving literacy 
and numeracy skills, developing greater self-esteem, pre-vocational 
training and practical work experience, and reducing re-offending by 
juvenile offenders.

Â

Around 100 community service providers nationwide 
are expected to be funded to provide JPET services in 1998-99. To find 
the JPET service nearest you, call the information line on   1800 657 569.
