Coalition escalates campaign against boat people

Democrats urge Labor to protect the rights 
of   genuine   refugees

Â

The Australian Democrats h ave condemned statements by the Prime 
Minister, Mr Howard on the boat people issue as patently false and part 
of a deliberate attempt to advance the Government’s own anti-refugee 
agenda.



Democrat Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew 
Bartlett, said it was completely false for the Prime Minister to blame 
the Senate for holding up measures which would address the boat people 
problem.

Â

“The Democrats have already ensured the passage 
of laws significantly increasing the penalties on people smugglers and 
the powers of officials to detect the organisers,” Senator Bartlett 
said.

Â

“It is also clear that the Senate will pass amendments 
to increase powers to board and confiscate boats used in people smuggling. 
The Senate will also support new measures to prevent people from applying 
for asylum if they already have haven in a third country.”

Â

“It is the Howard government which has chosen not 
to give priority to the Border Protection Bill, which has not even been 
brought on for debate in the House of Representatives. It is outrageous 
for the Prime Minister to blame the Senate when he hasn’t even got 
the Bill to the Senate yet.”

Â

“There is only one proposal which the Democrats 
have expressed opposition to — a plan to give genuine refugees only 
temporary visas.”

Â

“The Democrats oppose this because it will not stem 
the flow of illegal immigrants nor will it stop boat people and people 
smuggling. What it will do is increase the suffering of genuine refugees.”

Â

“The Coalition is using the boat people problem 
as a smokescreen to push through its own agenda to restrict the rights 
of genuine refugees. The two issues are quite separate.

Â

“The Labor Party is on record acknowledging that 
temporary visas for refugees would do nothing to address the people 
smuggling problem.”

Â

“It will be Labor’s shame if they bow to Liberal 
pressure and support this empty measure. This is nothing more than an 
attempt to con the Australian people.”
