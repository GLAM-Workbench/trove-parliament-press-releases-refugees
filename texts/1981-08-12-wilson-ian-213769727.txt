DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF WOMEN'S AFFAIRS SECONDED   TO ESCAP

The Director of the Office of Woman's Affairs, Ms Kathleen Taperel1,   is to be seconded to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the   Pacific (ESCAP),  to work with the Chief of ESCAP's Social Development   Commission, Dr V.J. Ram, in charting the future work of ESCAP in the inteÂ­  gration of women in development.

This was announced today by the Acting Minister for Foreign   Affairs, Senator Carrick,and Minister for Home Affairs and Environment,  Mr Ian Wilson..

The Ministers said that Ms Taperal1's appointment as a special   consultant would be for six months. Â·

She will leave Australia on 13 August for the ESCAP Secretariat   in Bangkok.  Her appointment follows the adoption of a resolution by   ESCAP at its 1981 session, requesting the ESCAP Executive Secretary to   establish a senior post to be responsible for the Commission's program for   ,  the integration of women into the development process.

The resolution also stated that arrangements should be   established for co-ordination and consultation within the ESCAP Secretariat   to ensure that the integration of women was reflected in all of the   Commission's programs. .

The Ministers said that Ms Taperel1 would be working with ESCAP   personnel responsible for administering programs in the Asian and Pacific   region. She would also be closely involved with specialist agencies such   as the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations High   Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organisation, the Food and   Agricultural Organisation and with technical development assistance agencies.

In discussions with these agencies, Ms Taperel1 would be   investigating the impact of their programs on women and ways of   ensuring that women participated in and benefited from development projects.

The Ministers said that Ms Taperel1, who had been Director of   the Office of Women's Affairs in the Department of. Home Affairs and   Environment since 1978, was well qualified to undertake the task of   establishing these arrangements. She represented Australia on the

preparatory committee for the World Conference for the United Nations   Decade for Women from 1978-1980, was a member of the delegation to   the world conference in 1980, and as head of the Office of Women's Affairs

had advised on international activities to promote the status of women.

.  "Australia has a common commitment with countries of the Asian and   Pacific region to work for the interests of women in the development process"   the Ministers said. "We have demonstrated this in supporting practical   programs in the region".

"Through our aid program and through our involvement in the United

Nations and other international organisations, we have consistently   supported positive and constructive measures to ensure that women are   active participants in the development process".

"Unless women are both participants in and beneficiaries of   development programs, the effectiveness of such programs can only.be   limited".

ESCAP : BACKGROUND NOTE

The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and

the Pacific, one of the five regional commissions of the

United Nations, was established in 1947 as the Economic

Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE). Members of

ESCAP consist of states within the geographical

scope of the commission, which extends from Iran to the

Cook Islands, together with five non-regional members -

France, the Netherlands, the USSR, the United Kingdom and

the United States. There are 43 members of ESCAP, including

eight non self-governing territories which have associate

status. ‘

ESCAP activities are.financed through various

United Nations agencies (59%) and from extra-budgetary

sources made available from donor governments .and agencies (41%).

Australia has a long-standing commitment to ESCAP based on

its value as a unique regional forum and the usefulness

of its activities in facilitating the economic and social

development of it's member countries. Consistent with

this policy, Australia has increased its level of extraÂ­

budgetary support for ESCAP over the years from $68,000

in 1974-75 to $1,078,000 in 1980-81.
