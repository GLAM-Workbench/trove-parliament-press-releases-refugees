MINISTER IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA FOR IMMIGRATION 
CONSULTATIONS

Â

A South African dentist in Coober Pedy and a French chemical engineer 
in Tanunda are just t wo examples of South Australia’s success 
attracting skilled migrants to regional areas of the State, the Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

Â

In Adelaide as part of national consultations on Australia’s 
1999-2000 migration program, Mr Ruddock said the number of migrants 
entering South Australia through the Skill stream increased by more 
than 51 per cent in 1997-98, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the 
year’s total migrant intake.

Â

“I applaud the efforts of South Australia, which 
is leading the way in attracting skilled migrants to Australia. By taking 
advantage of programs such as the   Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme  (RSMS) the State is able 
to help meet demand for qualified professionals outside of metropolitan 
areas.

Â

“The RSMS enables Australian employers in regional 
or low-growth areas to fill skilled permanent vacancies with overseas 
personnel if they cannot find suitably qualified workers in Australia.

Â

“Additionally, many areas now have direct access 
to the Skill Matching Database which enables employers to instantly 
find details of potential job applicants with the relevant skills and 
experience.

Â

“This resource presents employers in regional Australia 
with a great opportunity to fill positions that would otherwise remain 
vacant.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said South Australia was also successfully 
using the State/Territory Nominated Independent (STNI) Scheme to boost 
its skills base.

Â

“The STNI scheme is designed to allow States and 
Territories to ‘top-up’ identified shortages in the local labour 
market with relevant skills and experience by selecting migrants.

Â

“To South Australia’s credit, it is the only State 
currently making use of the STNI scheme even though it has been in operation 
now for two years.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the 1997-98   Settler Arrivals  statistical report shows that 1,157 people 
migrated to the state through the Skill stream last year, up from 765 
in 1996-97.

Â

Settler Arrivals also showed that:

Â

Â· Â Some 29.9 per cent of all permanent settlers to South Australia 
entered under the Family Stream, down from 45.2 per cent last year.

Â· Â The 
Humanitarian Program accounted for 17.2 per cent of arrivals in South 
Australia down from last year’s figure of 18.1 per cent.

Â

Â· Â The 
Non-Program migration category (mainly New Zealand citizens) attracted 
14.4 per cent of settlers, up on last year's figure of 13.3 per cent;

Â

Â· Â Among the new settlers to South Australia, were people from 
the United Kingdom (21.9%), New Zealand (9.6%), Bosnia-Herzegovina (6.1%), 
South Africa (6%), and India (5%).

Â

During this year's consultations the Minister will meet with a wide 
cross-section of individuals and organisations including representatives 
of business, economic, industry, union, environment, welfare, planning, 
refugee, humanitarian an d ethnic community groups.

Â

For the first time the immigration consultations include 
a nation-wide round of public meetings. Adelaide played host to its 
first-ever open meeting last night.

Consultations and public meetings are also being held 
in Melbourne, Griffith, Sydney, Albury-Wodonga, Perth, Canberra, Brisbane, 
Cairns and Darwin Launceston and Hobart.
