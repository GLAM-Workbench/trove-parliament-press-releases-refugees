VESSEL INTERCEPTED BY BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND

(4 May 2010) HMAS Childers operating under the control of Border Protection Command  last night successfully intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel, west of Ashmore  Islands.

The vessel was originally detected by a Customs and Border Protection Dash 8 surveillance  aircraft, operating under the control of Border Protection Command.



Initial indications suggest 36 passengers and one crew member are on board the vessel.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island for security, identity and health checks, and  their reasons for travel will be established.

The Australian Government changed the asylum seeker processing system, effective 9 April  2010, and suspended the processing of claims for Sri Lankan and Afghan nationals for at  least three and six months respectively as situations in both countries are evolving.

People who are owed Australia’s protection under our international obligations will be  granted that protection. Those who seek to exploit and put lives at risk through people  smuggling will face the full consequence of the law.

Since September 2008, the AFP has charged 136 people with offences under the Migration  Act 1958 (Cth). These offences attract a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
