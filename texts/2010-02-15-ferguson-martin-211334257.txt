Community organisations across Australia will share in more than $1.2 million of  funding, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services, Laurie Ferguson, announced today in the lead up to Harmony Day on  March 21.

‘The 28 successful applications for the Diverse Australia Program’s 2009 Community  Grants encompass a wide range of activities, all of which build an inclusive and  diverse society where everyone belongs,’ Mr Ferguson said.

‘In New South Wales, the Auburn Central: promoting rights and responsibilities  project will receive $49 000 to encourage social connections between local residents  from Turkish, Lebanese, Chinese, Afghan, Korean and Iraqi backgrounds.

‘In Western Australia, the Juluwarlu Group Aboriginal Corporation will receive  $50 000 to involve local Indigenous, non-Indigenous, and migrant groups in working  together to explore issues affecting their community through film.

‘In Victoria, Creativity Australia will receive $50 000 to run Singing for sunshine, a  community choir which will bring together migrants from the sub-Sahara, West  Africa, Middle East, South East Asia and Oceania.

‘The ACT’s Migrant and Refugee Settlement Services has received $26 600 for its  Harmony players project which will engage people aged 16 to 25 from new and  emerging communities in a range of sporting activities where they can build skills,  gain confidence and feel welcome in the mainstream community.

‘The arts, music and sport are all terrific mediums through which people can build  networks and strengthen a sense of belonging for all.’
