THAI/CAMBODIA BORDER REGION - AUSTRALIAN  _______  HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill Hayden MP,  announced in Kuala Lumpur today that Australia would provide

$810,000 to assist displaced Cambodians affected by recent  fighting in the Thai/Cambodia border region.

Mr Hayden said that following the recent Vietnamese  military activities along the border some 190,000 Cambodians

had been relocated to evacuation sites inside Thailand. This  had resulted in both the United Nations Border Relief Operation  (UNBRO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  issuing urgent international appeals for funds to continue

their humanitarian assistance programs for the evacuated population.

UNBRO will receive $530,000 for the care and maintenance  of Cambodian civilians in UNBRO camps, other than Khmer Rouge,  and $280,000 will be made available for the activities, mainly  medical, of the ICRC's Thai-Cambodia programme.

Mr Hayden said the Australian Government was making the

aid available to help meet the unexpected additional requirements  of the organisations caring for the Cambodians. Australia would

continue to monitor requirements and whether further appeals  were launched.
