DAVID LIPSON: Well joining me on the program now Assistant Infrastructure  Minister Jamie Briggs and the Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles,  thank you both very much for your time today, Richard Marles I might start with  you as the Shadow Immigration Minister can you explain to our viewers why it is  hard to stop people like this, who are giving this lecture on Friday, getting visas  to come to Australia.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION: Well freedom of speech is an important part of our  society and often sometimes denying people visas only makes matters worse,  but I think it is important to say that we will be doing everything we can to talk  to the Government about how we can stop hate speech being conducted in our  country. It’s important I think particularly at this time that we’re not having  people out there who are inciting division, we are obviously concerned about the  kind of comments that are being made by this particular organisation and it is  good to see that the Prime Minister is on board when it comes to dealing with  hate speech. Labor’s attitude towards hate speech has been very consistent, we

think it has no place in our society and it’s really important that we do everything  we can to stop it.

LIPSON: Jamie Briggs it will as you heard the Prime Minister say, will become  an offence to promote or advocate terrorism under this Foreign Fighters Bill that  is going through the Parliament at the moment, in fact there’s a joint committee  into it today here in Canberra, how does that sit with the Coalition’s preference  for freedom of speech.

JAMIE BRIGGS, ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Well freedom of speech in our society always has  limitations, it has limitations at Common Law, you can’t say even though David  you might have views about Richard or I, whatever you like, without being  sanctioned from time to time by Court, so there is an implied limit of freedom of  speech of course through Common Law, but when we’re talking about specific  cases here of clearly trying to incite action against Australians, well obviously  that is something which is beyond the pale, and that’s why we are amending the  laws to ensure that that can’t happen or is restricted to the extent that people  such as this can’t enter our country to incite hate against Australians.

LIPSON: This won’t happen as the Prime Minister made clear though before this  lecture on Friday, how does that make you feel as a Member of the Government,  that this lecture is taking place at a time that we are engaged in armed combat  in Iraq.

BRIGGS: Well I think that the Prime Minister’s expressed it quite well this  morning, he’s angry and disturbed by it, and I think that’s a fair assessment  about what most Australians would think, but I think it also endorses a strategy  that the Government is undertaking when it comes to strengthening the counter  terrorism laws that the Attorney-General is taking through the Parliament at the  moment, as you say herein today in respect of possible changes, in respect of  the counter terrorism laws or our security laws, our national security laws, and  this endorses the approach, to ensure that we’ve got the armoury needed both  domestically and internationally through our military to ensure that Australians  are safe.

LIPSON: The first round of anti-terrorism laws have passed through the  Parliament, the second round is in committee stage at the moment, Richard  Marles - Labor has said it will facilitate a swift passage of these laws but still  wants to look over in detail the legislation and that’s really in part what today is  about. Does Labor have any concerns with what is before it in this second round  of legislation, is there anything in there that Labor won’t support at this point?

MARLES: We want to have a look at the detail of this, you’d expect us to do  that, it’s a matter which is important and we’ve got to get this legislation right  and we’re going to do our job as representatives of the Australian people in the  Parliament to make our contribution. But having said all of that, we are at one  with the Government’s efforts to strengthen Australia’s national security  infrastructure, our disposition is obviously to be working with the Government to  do everything we can to deal with this issue, and if you look at the way in which  we’ve conducted matters over the last couple of months, it has been  characterised by a sense of bi-partisanship, and I’m sure that’s how it will be  going forward That doesn’t mean that we stop doing our job and don’t have a  good look at all the propositions that are put forward, but it is to say that we  bring to this a disposition of wanting to do everything we can to make sure that  Australians are as safe as possible during what is obviously a very concerning  and indeed scary time.

LIPSON: Okay I want to change tact and I want to get both of your responses  to this referral to the Australian Federal Police by Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, in relation to reports coming out of Nauru last Friday that were published  in Newscorp papers, Sarah Hanson-Young believes that some sections of that  report contained paragraphs of confidential information that may mean that the  Immigration Minister’s office has breached section 70 of the Crimes Act, the AFP  say they’re investigating, the Immigration Minister’s office won’t comment, Jamie  Briggs what’s your reaction to this referral from Senator Hanson-Young.

BRIGGS: Well I don’t have anything particular to say David, I think this is  something that is obviously the AFP has decided that they will look at the  complaint that has been raised by the Senator, that’s the proper process, they’ll  go through that process. But at the end of the day the Greens stand alone in the  Parliament as wanting to unpick the processes that were put in place which  ensure that the boats stopped arriving, they were able to convince the Labor  Party when the Labor Party were last in Government to support them in their bid  to in effect, open up Australia’s border security, they’ll do it again if the Labor  party get re-elected to the next election, there is a clear choice for Australians,  the policies of the Coalition which work, which have stopped the boats from  arriving, which ensured that we’ve got, that we’ve saved lives at sea, we’re  saving billions of dollars in the budget, that we’ve got a proper process for an  immigration program or the policies that we saw the last time the Labor party  and the Greens were in Government.

LIPSON: Richard Marles what do you make of this referral, do you see anything  before you that could trigger a breach of any law?

MARLES: Well firstly I’d say the Greens did a pretty good job in convincing the  Coalition to support them in opposing Labor’s plans around Malaysia which would

have dealt with this issue three years ago. But in terms of the specifics of this  report David, we’ll see whether or not there is any illegality in it, but what is  extraordinary is that you have contents of a Government report appearing in our  media which makes very serious allegations about a service provider, before that  service provider is even told about the existence of the report let alone the  allegations contained within it.

Save the Children were told to take 10 of their staff off Nauru without being  given any explanation whatsoever, and yet you see parts of that explanation in  the newspapers the following day, that is extraordinary behaviour from a  Government which has a media strategy which is certainly not in the public  interest, might be in their own interest but not in the public interest. I mean  they’re happy to put censored material all over the newspapers but when there is  a question which they find hard to answer, at that moment it seems to become  an operational matter and they can’t talk about it.

LIPSON: Jamie Briggs I’ll give you an opportunity to respond to that matter but  also just on the secrecy of the Operation Sovereign Borders compared to the  operation currently taking place, a military one as well in Iraq, where we are  getting regular updates, it was announced via Twitter, we’re getting another  update today from the Chief of the Defence Force, why is one so secret and the  other one so public?

BRIGGS: Well because that is the advice of the Defence chiefs David, we’re  following the advice of the Defence chiefs on how we implement particular  operations, the Operation Sovereign Borders let me remind you is not a military  operation, the engagement in Iraq is clearly a military operation. What we’re  doing in stopping the boats is fulfilling the promise we made before the election,  the Labor Party doesn’t like it, the Labor Party said we couldn’t do it, the Labor  Party said you couldn’t turn boats around well we’ve been able to this year  ensure that the boats have stopped arriving, indeed there’s been boat turn  arounds as we said there would be, because we’re sending a very strong  message to people smugglers that your business is not welcome in Australia, we  want to have an orderly immigration process where we select people who get  the opportunity to live in our country, not people smugglers. The Labor Party  have a different view, and again the choice for Australians at the next election  will be clear, do you want to go back to the policies that Richard and his  colleagues put in place when they were in Government which saw thousands of  people arrive by boat or do you want to stick with what the Coalition have  delivered and that is stopping the boats arriving in the first place by destroying  the business model of the people smugglers.

LIPSON:  Okay a lot more to get through on the program this morning including  the push for another round of Labor party reform and also the Government’s

decision to abandon the plan to force unemployed people to apply for 40 jobs a  month, all of that coming up after the break.

Commercial break  LIPSON: Thanks for your company on AM Agenda.  Yesterday the Government  abandoned plans to force unemployed people to apply to 40 jobs a month in  order to get the dole, there were also reports that the Government is about to  abandon another controversial plan to force people under 30 to receive no dole  for six months.  I’m still joined by Richard Marles and Jamie Briggs, Jamie first  you, is that true, is the Government about to abandon the six month waiting  period?

BRIGGS: Well firstly can I correct one issue, we didn’t abandon the 40 job  applications yesterday, what we did was have a consultation over a proposal  which was put out by the relevant Minister, and through the consultation process  the Government accepted the advice of people who engage in that consultation  process that it wouldn’t have the effect that we were looking for, we stand  absolutely firmly by the policy that is, we want young people either working or  learning in fact it’s a policy which is supported across the political spectrum. We  know that Jenny Macklin herself back in 2005 was spruiking earning or learning,  so it is something which is supported across the political divide, I know Richard  himself down in Geelong where there are issues with unemployment at the  moment through structural economic change, is someone who advocates people  either having a job or learning to get a better future, it’s something that we  pursue as a Government with vigour and we’ll continue to pursue with vigour,  because we think it’s really important for the future strength of our economy that  we’ve got as many people active in the workplace that we can possibly have, we  don’t’ want -

LIPSON: But what about specifically that six month waiting period, is that  something that you would like to see pushed on or put on the back burner?

BRIGGS: Of course it’s part of what we announced as part of our response in  the budget to fixing the Labor debt and deficit crisis that we were left, but also  by it’s about ensuring that we’ve got as many people active in the labour force in  the future as we get to a point where our population grows older and we have  less taxpayers, there is only two ways you can fill your labour force, it’s by  ensuring that you got the highest participation rate amongst people who live in  Australia, Australians, or you have to import skills, they’re the only two ways that  you can ensure that you’ve got the needs fulfilled within your labour force, and  what we want is Australians to have opportunities at jobs, young Australians to  have opportunities at jobs and what we see at the moment is youth  unemployment at levels which are higher than what we would like to see.

LIPSON: Richard Marles perhaps firstly on the 40 jobs a month, as Jamie Briggs  pointed out, there was an open and consultative period which returned advice  and some from business that they didn’t want to be swamped by too many box  ticking job applications and they have listened to that consultation so why is  Labor so critical?

MARLES: Well I think it’s a relief for every Australian that what Jamie’s just said  is that the whole budget was not so much a set of plans but was a proposition to  be consulted about over the last few months, and on the basis of the feedback  that the Government’s heard not just about this issue but about the entire  budget presumably, it is time for the Government to abandon the budget in  whole.

It is a good thing that they have reversed their plans around this proposition of  requiring people to seek 40 jobs within a month, this is really just a strategy to  try and vilify people who don’t have a job, which is pretty rich in circumstances  where this is a Government which has absolutely and consciously gone about the  business of closing down the car industry for example, it has goaded  manufacturing offshore and when you live in a community like the one that I do  in Geelong, we’ve seen a harpoon to our heart in terms of the manufacturing  base within our economy, and what they’re then going to do is for all the people  who have lost their jobs they’re going to put them in the gun as well.

It is absolutely time for them to reverse this, and in terms of the proposition  about requiring people under 30 to have no means for six months, this is  ridiculous, it is all fine to say that people should be learning and earning no  problem with that at all, but it’s an entirely different question to expect people to  survive for six months without any means whatsoever.

LIPSON: Jamie Briggs a quick response to that.

BRIGGS: Well Richard the hyperventilation from the Labor Party, no wonder  John Faulkner is so distressed about the future of the modern Labor Party, I  mean Richard of course forgets that it was Paul Keating himself who started the  process which leads to the challenges of the manufacturing industry, heavy  manufacturing industry employers face today, and he put in beautifully in the  Keating interviews on the ABC where he said that the people who went from  those production lines had an opportunity for a better job, but the reality is that  more than 90 per cent of our budget has passed and if Richard was paying  attention, the issue in respect of the 20 - 40 job applications wasn’t a budget  measure, but anyway we’ll let John Faulkner continue to commentate on the  Labor Party.

LIPSON: Well speaking of John Faulkner, that’s exactly the topic I want to look  into now, another push from the Labor elder overnight for a new round of  reforms here’s some of what he said:

JOHN FAULKNER, SENATOR FOR NEW SOUTH WALES: And I say to those who  resist the opening up of our structures to more participation and more  democracy, because they see their control over managed and pre-negotiated  outcomes slipping away, stop clinging to the wheel, you are steering us straight  for the rocks”

LIPSON: Richard Marles would you like to see the unions influence over Federal  Party decisions at National Conference diminished from 50 per cent at the  moment down to 20 per cent as John Faulkner suggests.

MARLES: We’ll go through each of the particular propositions around opening  up the Party, I think that the influence of unions in terms of the decision making  of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party is vastly over-stated, but the point that  John makes which is an absolutely reasonable point that he did in that clip there,  is that we do need to be opening up our party, we do need to have more people  participating in it, and that’s exactly what we’ve seen since the election, the  election of the Leader of the Labor Party, which saw Party members participate  in that. That was an enormous transformation in terms of opening up a key  decision, almost the key decision within the Party to a broader range of party  members, you’re not about to see that happen any time soon in the Liberal  Party, and since then we’ve seen the Labor Party grow at an unprecedented rate  which means more and more people are participating in our decisions and having  a say. And so this is exactly the direction that we need to be going in and I think  the contribution that John Faulkner made last night is a really positive one, and  we need to continue that discussion but David I think we’re well on the way to  that reform.

LIPSON: Jamie Briggs 30 seconds left, the Royal Commission into unions has  been extended for another year, that won’t be cheap, is it worth it?

BRIGGS: Well obviously the evidence that we’ve seen shows it is worth it, I  mean what you saw John Faulkner talk about last night was in a sense a direct  shot at Bill Shorten, this is the Labor party at the beginning of the next war,  Anthony Albanese is advocating very similar thoughts to John Faulkner, Bill  Shorten of course is seen as the head faction chief, the faction of the factions  guy, we saw that when he knifed Kevin Rudd then he knifed Julia Gillard, so this  is the building of the next war in the Labor party, and again the Australian  people have the choice at the next election, do they want to go back to this  chaos.

LIPSON: Jamie Briggs, Richard Marles we are out of time, thanks for your  company.
