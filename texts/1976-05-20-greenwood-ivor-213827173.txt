' Canberra A.C.T.

EMBARGO UNTIL 8.00pm, 20 MAY 1976

STATEMENT BY THE HONOURABLE M.J.R. MACKELLAR,  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS,  ACTING FOR THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT,  HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

The statements by the Prime Minister and the

Treasurer on the Government's strategy for combatting

inflation and restoring employment apply particularly

to proposed expenditure in the areas encompassed by the .

Environment, Housing and Community Development portfolio.

The Government has had to review programs in

the light of the overallÂ· budgetary position and bearing

in mind such matters as :

.  that those uho can afford to should pay their

oun way;

.  that to be effective assistance must be directed

to those in greatest need;

.  that matters which are seen as the primary

responsibility of other spheres of government

should be undertaken by them;

.  that the activities of government wherever possible

should not overlap or conflict with activities

more effectively performed by the private sector.

. . . / 2

Accordingly,  the Government has examined the suitability

of the programs as an effective means of achieving its

objectives and it has considered and will continue to

consider alternatives to present programs.

As indicated in the Treasurer's statement, the

Government is continuing to review a number of programs

and activities so that as a matter of urgency it can take

decisions based on a knowledge of all the facts. These

programs include the growth centres,  land commissions, ;  '

the national sewerage program,  rehabilitation of the Glebe

Estate,  Area Improvement, Assistance for Leisure Facilities

and support for Sporting and Recreational bodies.

'In the meantime the Government will, of course, \

fulfil all existing legal commitments. ,

The Government's position on individual programs

bearing in mind the overall economic circumstances and in Ã¢ÂÂ

the light of its philosophy and objectives is outlined below.

LAND CDMMISSIONS

The Government has decided that this program be

included in the urgent review of a number of urban and

regional development progr a m s . It is intended that the

review of the program will be completed prior to the budg e t .

. . . / 3

In the meantime adequate funds will be made available to

meet legal and contractual commitments.  Total funds to

meet legal commitments uill amount to $14.3m compared to

a forward estimate of $41m for 1976/77.

GROUTH CENTRES .

.The growth centres programs are among those

subject to review. The Government is fully aware of the .

problems that uncertainty can cause to business confidence

in.the centres and as a result has directed that the review

be carried out as a matter of urgency.  The outcome of the

review will be available before the budget is brought down.

In the meantime the Government will ensure that

all outstanding legal commitments in Albury/Uodonga will

be met fully. The amount required to meet these commitments

is estimated at $9m.  By contrast the Departmental bid for

1976/77 was $45m.

The Commonwealth role in the growth centres at

Bathurst/Orange,  Macarthur and Monarto will also be considered

in the review. Legal commitments will be met from an initial

bid of $64.Om for these growth centres’  and proposed centres

at Geelong and Townsville.

GLEBE - '

An urgent reuieu is under way to consider the

appropriate role of the Commonwealth in the rehabilitation

of the Glebe estate. The Commonwealth will fulfil all

existing commitments during the review period and $ 1.1m

has been set aside for 1976/77. The initial bid was for

$5.4m; the estimate for rent during 1976/77 is $0.8m.  It

is expected that the review will be completed before the

budget is brought down.

NATIONAL 5EUERAGE PROGRAM '

An urgent review of the program is being undertaken.

In the meantime,  a reduced level of funds has been allocated,

given our budgetary difficulties. In 1976/77, $50m will be

made available compared to a bid of $ 145m for 1976/77.

HOUSING AGREEMENTS

The Prime Minister intends to announce the funds

available for the Commonweal th/ s tate Housing Agreement

during the Premiers' Conference in June. At the Conference

the future of the Agreement will also be discussed. The Â·

twin aims of the Commonwealth Government are to both increase

the flexibility the States have to determine the disposition

of funds and to ensure that assistance is directed to those

in need.  It is expected that negotiation with the States

can begin at the Housing Ministers' Conference on 24 May.

c o m m u n i t y  a s s i s t a n c e  .

A review of the objectives of community assistance

programs is underway to ensure their consistency with our

philosophy. This will be available shortly. In the meantime

all existing commitments of $11.6m will be met fully compared

to a bid of $25m.

In the same way the Commonwealth's role in providing

funds for organisations concerned with sport and physical

fitness is being re-examined.  All commitments amounting to

about $ 1m are being met,  a saving of more than $2m from the

bid of $3.2m.  '

NATIONAL PARKS AND WILDLIFE SERVICE

An announcement about the. functions and activities

of the Parks and Wildlife Service may be expected shortly.  i

An amount of $1.4m will be provided in 1976/77 compared with

a bid of more than $4m.  This may be reduced in the event

that the present proposed activities for the service are

not fully implemented.

NATIONAL ESTATE '  '

An announcement concerning the manner of operation

of the Australian Heritage Commission can be expected shortly.

In 1976/77 expenditure for the National Estate will be

restricted to that already committed, $1.35m, compared to

a bid of some $8m.  1

OTHER PROGRAMS

Savings have also been made in other programs of

the Ministry.  '

An outline of the government's intentions for

the programs not- covered in this statement is attached.

As indicated in the Treasurer's statement,  an

intensive review of tne major programs is being undertaken.

At this stage savings of some $4Q0m have been made. The \

Prime Minis te r will, seek an early meeting uith the State

Premiers on the effect of these cuts and program reviews

with a view to discussing future financing arrangements.

ATTACHMENT

OTHER PROGRAMS

TRANSITORY ACCOMMODATION

This item relates in the main to support uhich

is provided from the Budget to Commonwealth Hostels Ltd;

which provides accommodation for immigrants,  and for public

servants.  Savings of up to $ 1m ui11 be sought in this

area,  without affecting our commitment to continue the

programs. This would put 1976/77 expenditure at $6.8m

compared with $9.2m this year. (The 1975/76 figure .

includes costs associated with accommodating Timorese

refugees).

AUSTRALIAN HOUSING CORPORATION (DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES SCHEME)

Funds to be provided to the Australian Housing

Corporation in 1976/77 will be sufficient to cover existing

firm commitments and additional expenditure uhich would

arise on the basis of the existing waiting period.

This amount is currently estimated at $43.5m. -

Â·  At that level of funding the Corporation's gross

outlay,  on lending and construction activity ,  would be about

$ 110m ,  compared with a budgeted outlay of $122.5m in 1976/76.

z.

To remove the waiting period would require an

additional capital advance to the Corporation in 1976/77

of $46m.

LAND FOR MATURE CONSERVATION

The Commonwealth has over the past two years

provided assistance to the States for acquisition of land

to be included in State national parks and wildlife reserves.

The 1975/76 Budget included $ 1.8m for this program.

In 1976/77 the Government will be meeting all

outstanding commitments. This will involve $0.4m for

completion of the 1975/76 program of acquisition,  and a

further $2.7m to meet commitments made in 1975/76 that

require funding this year.

In all,  1976/77 expenditure under this head will

be $3.1m, in comparison with a Departmental forward estimate

of $6.4m.  Â·

NORTHAiEST TASMANIA LIATER SUPPLY

At this time, the Government has decided that it

cannot enter into discussion on the North/Uestern Tasmania

Water Supply Scheme until agreement is reached by the local

authorities concerned. The Commonwealth's decision would

of course be made with full regard for the estimated costs

of the scheme, which have risen by 70^ since the original

offer of' assistance was made. The forward estimates had

provided for an expenditure of $ 1m under this head.

Wales have been undertaking a collaborative soil conservation

study over the past year.

The aim of the study is to provide Commonwealth

and State Governments-with information basic to the formulation

of long-term soil conservation and associated land management

programs.  It is due for completion early in the new financial

year.

The Government will provide the funds needed to

complete the study, and to meet any other outstanding

commitments in relation to soil conservation projects

presently being supported.  This will involve about $388,000

in 1976/77, in comparison with a forward estimate of $3.5m.

ADELAIDE WATER TREATMENT SCHEME

assistance to South Australia for a scheme to improve the

the scheme. .

BRISBANE FLOOD MITIGATION PROJECT '

40 per cent of the cost of flood mitigation work on

Breakfast Creek and Enoggera Creek in Brisbane.

It is currently expected that expenditure on

these projects uill be $4.6m in 1976/77, of which the

Commonwealth's share would be $1.84m.

There are a number of heads of expenditure of ^

the Department of Environment, Housing and Community

The Commonwealth is providing assistance to New

South Wales for a program of works to control serious

pollution of the Molonglo River above Canberra.

in the Captain's Flat area.
