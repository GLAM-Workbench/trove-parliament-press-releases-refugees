Speech by the Leader of the Opposition

the National Union of Greek Australian Students

Melbourne, 9 January 1977

I am honoured that my first public'engagement in

Melbourne in the New Year is among.the Greek community.

I hardly need to tell you that over the years I have developed

a particular affect ion-,, for the Greek people, Â·  for their homeland,

their language and their culture. Among my keenest pleasures

in public life has been meeting and mixing with Greek people

and their, families around Australia. Australians tend to

forget how much of their own culture, their language, their

religion, their spiritual and civilised values has come to us

directly from Greece or through Greece. We forget that only

China, the Nile Valley and parts of the Euphrates Valley have

civilizations older, than that of the Greeks'. Australia is

immensely fortunate that so large and vigorous a segment of

her population is made up of people steeped in Greek culture and

the values of Greek civilization. The beneficiaries of our

immigration program are not so much the migrants but Australia

itself - the whole Australian community.

I welcome these opportunities to.be among you because

I firmly, believe that the- key to our future as a nation, as

a.people, as a distinctive community in our region and the world

lies increasingly with our immigrant communities. -  The more we

look back on the post-war immigration program the more we can

see what profound and far-reaching changes it has wrought on

Australian life. We can see how deeply it has changed the,face^

of our population and will change it yet further.

Australia has always been a nation of immigrants; but the great

difference!between immigration after World War II and all previous " .  . .  :  L .

immigrationJwas the high proportion of non-British people,

first from northern and western Europe - some 200,000 refugees

came to Australia in the immediate post-war years - and later

from southern Europe, particularly from Italy, Yugoslavia and

Greece. Immigrants supplied slightly more than half the nation's

population growth from,just over 7.5 million in 1947 to

11..5 million in 19 6 6_, and the trend has continued since.

If it were not for immigration Australia's population today

would be no more than 10 million. Another way of putting

it is this: almost a quarter of Australia's present population

,  is of post-war immigrant stock. One in every four people

in Australia was born overseas or born of parents from overseas.

Yet what has been the reaction of Australians to this

immense change in our population, in our social makeup, in the

very face of our nation? It has been one of extraordinary

indifference and lethargy. Our major'institutions - .

parliaments, trade unions, businesses, professions - have barely

taken account of these changes. This huge shift in our

demographic character, this enormous alteration in the composition

of the Australian people, has taken place over the past

30 years.,, yet Australians- on the whole, have reacted as. if it

had never happened. ,  Where are the migrants in our Parliaments?

There are a few, certainly; but nothing like a representative

number. Where are the migrants at the head of Government

departments or running our industries or universities? In whole

areas of life and work - science, technology,  trade, the media,

in many of. the professions - migrants are barely represented.

I find this situation all the more extraordinary because

there haSj never been any question that immigration was X;  popular wijth. the majority of our people. The immigration ' " '  -1 Â· Â·

program was begun by a Labor Government and continued

by governments of all political persuasions. Migrants should

be as prominently placed and as influential and conspicuous

in Australian life today as any other Australians. Yet

plainly this is not the case. Somewhere along the line the

full implications of the immigration program have been

shirked. There can be no question that migrants are

popular in this country, but equally there can be no

question that most migrants still do not enjoy the same

opportunities as other Australian citizens. .  .

Perhaps I can give examples of the sort of attitudes

prevalent in Australian society which make life more difficult

for migrants. IÂ·, am not thinking so much of overt discrimination

or of the disabilities many migrants suffer in housing,

education and employment. ,  I shall deal with these questions

in a moment. Take the problem of languages. The u n s poken.

assumption in any discussion of language problems among

migrants is that migrants have an obligation to learn

English, arid that their native language, at least as far

as their children are concerned, might as well be discarded.

Now clearly a knowledge of English is essential' for immigrants,

and my own Government did a great deal to improve language

training. Most authorities would probably agree that the

language question is at the root of migrant satisfaction and .

fulfilment in their new environment. My point is that better

communication through language training should be a two-way proces

.../4

We should not expect Greeks to discard their own language; it

would be' just as much to the point if other Australians were

to learn'a little Greek. Australian schools should be putting

Ã¢ÂÂ   \  ;  | . much'more/stress on teaching modern languages. I see no Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  I '  !reason why we should not be aiming to produce a society in which the growing generation has at least, a couple of languages apart from English. ..  As another example, take the media. As a general rule Ã¢ÂÂ   \ . . .  -  ’  Â·I do not think the media give enough attention to migrant activities. It is for this reason that we have a large ethnic press in Australia. One reason for the popularity of ethnic newspapers is that the established press in Australia still sees the world in a very blinkered perspective. The tragic conflict in Cyprus has killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands of others, yet it is given far less attention in the Australian media, and has a far greater impact on the lives of people in this country than, say, the events in Ulster. A quarter of a million Greeks have come to Australia since the war; they are the third largest group of immigrants in this country. The interests of prospective refugees from the Lebanon and Cyprus are of far greater importance, in both human and practical terms, to substantial numbers of our people than, refugees from, say,Vietnam or -Rhodesia; yet-their fate- is largely ignored.  by .  .the media and given only the most perfunctory attention by the Department of Immigration. What must hundreds of thousands of migrants feel when the events in their homelands and neighbouring regions are given such scant and disproportionate attention in the Australian press and by Australian Government authorities?

The truth is that Australians have not faced up .  !  . "  -

to the realities of our post-war immigration policy.  We Ã¢ÂÂ¢  V  , . .  '  ;  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  Â·  .  Â·

Ã¢ÂÂ   .have', not accepted the 'challenge to established attitudes .

.  Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·  '  j  Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   . and values which that policy poses. We are still treating  a quarter of Australia's population as if they did not e x i s t .

It is not enough merely to end discrimination. My Government

did as much as any government could do - through ifs

anti-discrimination laws, its initiatives on human rights, . Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   ' Â·  vV .  Ã¢ÂÂ

its acceptance of United Nations conventions, its

creation of the Office of. Commissioner for Community Relations -

to remove the handicaps of prejudice and discrimination

wherever they existed. But there is still a need for more

positive and constructive measures. Migrants must be

full andi equal citizens,, enjoying the same rights and

opportunities as all other Australians. That is where

governments - State and Federal - still have much to do.

There can be no question that migrants have been

disadvantaged by being forced to live:Â· mainly in the

impoverished heartlands,the capital cities and outer-

suburban regions where community services are under-developed .

or non-existent. Efforts to improve the quality of urban

life are efforts to improve the lives of migrants as much

as anyone._ All Labor's social programs are designed to .

enlarge .the .opportunities of people"- both old and new .

Australians - w h o .are unfairly disadvantaged in some way.

Usually we find that people's opportunities vary according

to where people live. The Greek community in Australia,

and migrants in general, tend to live in areas where schools are

poorer. Labor's reforms in education were designed to give

most help to the schools in greatest need. Again, migrants

.  of ten live in suburbs without major hospitals or healthÂ·, centres.

..S.o we introduced Medibank. .  Â· .  .It was-not merely-anÂ· Ã¢ÂÂ   efficient - Â·  -

system of health insurance - the most efficient system

possible - but provided funds to the States for hospitals

andxtieal^h centres where people needed them; if necessary,

we were, prepared as a federal government to go ahead

and build, those hospitals and health centres ourselves.

We wanted migrants to have the same rights under the law

and the same access to the law as other Australians;

we established legal aid. We wanted migrants to have the

same rights to social security and wellbeing in old age

and retirement; we introduced the principle of portability

of pension rights.  We wanted migrants to enjoy the same

access to broadcasting services in their own languages;  we

set up ethnic radio. We wanted migrants to play, their .

full and rightful part with other Australians at the head

of statutory authorities and on boards and councils of ,  .

.  public bodies; we appointed men and woman with,Â· the right Ã¢ÂÂ   .

qualifications to these bodies whenever they were available.

All these measures were designed to promote

equality of opportunity for our people, and under the next

Labor Government they will be carried on and intensified.

At the same time we recognise that the key fo our efforts, the

key to your aspirations, lies in education. Equality in

education is, and always, has been,_the key to equality

of opportunity in society at large. When in the Labor Party

we talk about equality in education we don't mean that all

schools should be the same, or that everyone should have

the same sort of education. Our opponents and various .

sectional interests used to pretend that Labor believed in

some sort of enforced conformity or regimentation,

.  . ./7

but ..events have shown that thi-s was not our-policy -  at' a l l .

We set up the Schools Commission to make sure that when

public)money was spent on education it was spent first

and foremost on the schools that needed it. Of all the -

J l '

reforms.that Labor introduced this is one that Mr Fraser

has not yet dared to reverse. The view we take as a party and

a government is not that money can solve all problems in

education, but that where money is spent it must be spent

on the schools that need it, in regions and suburbs

that need it, and for the children who need it. Our

ultimate objective is to see that schools everywhere are as good

as schools anywhere.

There can be no excuse for any Australian Government

failing to take account of the special educational problems

of migrants. As Greeks you will know that there is a very

high concentration of Greek children in schools in inner city

and outer suburban regions where teaching services and

facilities are below the standards accepted in other a r eas.

Numerous public: inquiries and reports have drawn Governments'

attention to the problems this raises f o r .  migrant children. .

Last August, the Commissioner for Community Relations,

Mr. Grassby, reported that 700,000 Australian school children

had a first language other than English, and that this

could lead to two yearsV retardation in many cases.-"' M r . Grassby

reported that reforms in child migrant education were more

urgent now than ever. T he Labor Government always treated .

this problem seriously. '  In 1974 we initiated an inquiry

by officers of the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian

education departments into schools with high migrant density.-

The inquiry recommended the establishment of pilot programs

-8-

of. .bilingual education and special centresÂ· where children--

could be taught English before they enrolled at school; it

recommended the appointment of more ethnic welfare officers

and. other. .  ancillary staff, in schools of high migrant Ã¢ÂÂ   .  .  I

density. The report showed that more than 80 per cent of

children in some schools in New South Wales and Victoria .  : Â·  Â·

are of non-English speaking backgrounds. .  In one such

school more than 300 children had parents who were both .

working. On 15 October the House of Representatives

Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties urged

State education departments to recruit teachers from

ethnic groups who could talk with migrant children in

.  their, own languages.  The Labor Government recognised

that these needs were particularly acute in the outer .

suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. Funds for migrant

education programs rose from $6.5m. in 1971-72 to

$2 3.. 6m. in 1975-76, of which the largest increase was ,

in funds for child migrants. The Fraser Government

has given no indication that it endorses the findings

of these inquiries or will take any action to deal with the

problems raised. .  .  .

Most of the handicaps and problems faced by

immigrants in Australia are the result of the policies

of successive Liberal Governments. The conservative .

parties have" always regarded the immigration program

primarily as a source of factory fodder for manufacturing

industry, not as a. noble social experiment, not as a

nation-building venture,  not as the path to a great

new multi-cultural society, but purely as an economic tool.

As such it succeeded well enough. Australia has imported

a huge overseas workforce,  the largest in the world outside

of Israel. Apart from the Aboriginals and the pensioners, '  .  h .../9

the Commissioner for Community Relations, 27 per cent of all

j-

Australian.wage earners were born outsideÂ·Australia. /  The report states:

.The overseas-born are generally at the bottom

of the socio-economic ladder even after long

periods of residence in Australia ... of the

immigrants who arrived between 1949 and 1954

more t hanÂ·80% of some ethnic groups are still

in the .lower skilled occupations.

There is abundant evidence on this point in a book

published a month ago by the ANU Press - "Greek Children

in Sydney" by Eva Isaacs. She refers to a sample of 1600

Greek.women living in the inner suburbs of Sydney..  Well

over a third of those with jobs worked as factory hands;

only. 10 of the others had skilled occupations. This is

the picture of our immigrant workforce: deprived,

isolated, condemned to the meanest occupations, cut

off from opportunities for advancement and social betterment.

It is not good engough. Mr. Jim Bayutti, a prominent .

member of the Italian community in Australia, appointed

by my Government to the board of Qantas said at a recent

seminar in Sydney:

The" unacceptable treatment of immigrants in the

past, t h e .casual nature of their acceptance, the

failure to recognise their normal needs to

promote their self-esteem and dignity could

create.deep and lasting tensions in the national

life of this country - as well as denying it the

full fruits of the immigrant intake with its .  ,

unique capacity to contribute to a better

Thirty1  years of post war immigration have given. Australia \  : Ã¢ÂÂ   ,ÃÂ¯ ,  .

.a ^ireciious opportunity, a; vast potential for ".growth"

and enrichment. The tragedy is that this opportunity has

been largely thrown away, Migrants have given much to .

Australia: Australia has given too little in return.

Our industries have looked on immigrants as mere workers

and consumers; ourÂ·professions have excluded them; '  .  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  '

our governments -have too often ignored their needs..

It is time we revised our whole attitude to the immigration

program, its objectives, its methods, its underlying

assumptions.. The old emphasis on numbers for their own

sake can no longer be justified; my Government abandoned it

The Liberals believed that a Government's responsibility

for immigrants ended when they arrived in Australia; that

attitude too was ..discarded.  by my Government and there is

no place for it today. Above all we must keep in mind

the fundamental goals of a humane immigration policy.

We cannot.go on treating immigrants as a submerged and

deprived segment of the workforce. We must welcome them

as part of an enlarged and changing Australian family,

as equal citizens in a great multi-national and multiÂ­

cultural society. .  I believe that our future strength

and influence as. a nation may well depend on the way .

.  we treat the quarter of our people who have come to us,

directly or indirectly, from overseas.
