VISIT TO BANGLADESH



This coming week, I am visiting Bangladesh along with my parliamentary colleagues from

across the political spectrum.



As a result of ongoing persecution in Myanmar, there has been a rapid escalation of the

Rohingya refugee crisis in recent years. There are now over 900,000 displaced Rohingya

living in Bangladesh at one of the world’s largest refugee camps - Cox’s Bazar.



In Bangladesh, I will be briefed by the Australian High Commission on Australia’s

humanitarian assistance being provided in response to this crisis that has unfolded in our

region.



There are a number of programs being funded by government, NGOs and corporate

entities throughout Bangladesh to address women’s safety, child protection, education,

sanitation and the risk of extreme poverty being faced by some of the world’s most

vulnerable people.



I will see these programs firsthand when I visit Cox’s Bazar - including a variety of those

run by Save the Children, CARE Australia and Oxfam.



I will meet officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to

hear about their work with the Bangladesh Government to provide Rohingya refugees



identification documents for the first time in their lives.



This trip has been organised by Save the Children and their Australian Regional

Leadership Initiative - made possible by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates

Foundation - which has hosted 39 political leaders across nine learning tours. This is their

second delegation to visit Bangladesh.



Australia has provided $105 million dollars in official development assistance to

Bangladesh and it will be greatly beneficial to see our country’s humanitarian efforts

firsthand.
