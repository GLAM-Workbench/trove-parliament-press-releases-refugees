Greens urge greater support for former detainees

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has condemned the Federal Government and  Opposition’s refusal to investigate the psychological harm caused to children held in  mandatory detention as inhumane.

Senator Hanson-Young yesterday moved a motion calling on the Government to  widen its current inquiry into immigration detention in Australia to urgently look into  the psychological effects on children and their families. Only the Greens and the two  other cross-bench Senators supported it.

“The Tampa incident entered Australia’s history books as a blight on our human  rights record seven years ago this week, and yet we still have not taken  responsibility for the impact it has had on innocent people,” said Senator Hanson-Young.

Last  month  the  Greens  welcomed  the  Government’s  changes  to  its  mandatory   detention  policy,  but  said  that  there  were  ongoing  issues  for  former  detainees  that   needed to be addressed.

“Australia likes to think of itself as a compassionate, just society, but the fact is that  we have failed our international obligations to refugees in the past.”

“We have a duty to assist people affected by their time spent locked up in the  system, even if they are no longer detained.”

Senator Hanson-Young has been made a full voting member of the Joint Standing  Committee on Migration.

“I will be using my role on the Committee to ensure that this issue is not ignored any  longer,” she said.

“We must restore our respect for human rights and urgently attend to those suffering  the  long-term  effects  and  psychological  scarring  caused  by  treatment  in  detention,   and particularly children.”
