PRESS CONFERENCE  Sydney  30 August 2012

Topics: Search and rescue off Indonesian coast, Australian fatalities in  Afghanistan

JASON CLARE:   Good morning everyone. I have just been briefed by the head  of Border Protection Command, Rear Admiral David Johnston.  I can provide you with the latest information.

This information, as you know, is always subject to change,

and more information will be available throughout the course of  the day. But this is the latest information.  Right now a major  search and rescue effort is underway, forty-five nautical miles  off the coast of Indonesia.  The search and rescue effort is  being led by the Indonesian search and rescue authority,  BASARNAS, with the assistance and the support of Australia's  Rescue Coordination Centre which is part of AMSA, the  Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

Three merchant vessels are currently on scene.  They are

APL Bahrain, MV Gwendoline and MV Forever South  West.  The master of MV Bahrain has reported that he has  recovered six survivors.  A fourth merchant vessel, MV  Chemroute, is also responding to the request for assistance.  A  Defence P3 aircraft is expected to be over the search and  rescue area in about one hour's time.

Two Indonesian search vessels are heading towards the

area.  They are expected to arrive at three o'clock this  afternoon, Eastern Standard Time.  HMAS Maitland has also

been tasked to assist, and it will arrive on the scene at  approximately four o'clock Eastern Standard Time.

Let me now go through a chronology of events starting early

yesterday morning.  At 4:20 am and at 5:05 am yesterday RCC  Australia received two phone calls from a person on board a  vessel requesting assistance.  In the second phone call the  person provided RCC with the vessel's location, approximately  eight nautical miles south-west of Java.  They also reported  that there were one-hundred-and-fifty people on board  including women and children, and they said that the vessel  had engine failure and it was taking on water.

RCC Australia alerted BASARNAS to the possible search

and rescue incident, and BASARNAS assumed coordination for  the response.  RCC Australia then issued a broadcast to  merchant vessels in the area on behalf of BASARNAS and  offered further assistance if it was required.  BASARNAS  informed RCC Australia that they had tasked two rescue  vessels and two helicopters to search the area.

The first helicopter arrived in the area at mid-afternoon

yesterday Eastern Standard Time.  At approximately four  o'clock Eastern Standard Time yesterday RCC Australia  received a fax from BASARNAS indicating that the helicopter  had searched the location and hadn't found any signs of the  vessels, hadn't found any signs of distress.  The fax also  indicated that all other assets had been released from Tasking.

A Customs and Border Protection Dash 8 departed

Christmas Island at approximately four o'clock Eastern  Standard Time yesterday to conduct routine surveillance. The  Dash 8 searched the area north of Christmas Island, and  searched an area where it was calculated that a vessel might  be if it had continued to motor or drift towards Christmas Island.

During this surveillance, AMSA obtained updated vessel

location using commercially available satellite telephone  positioning data.  RCC requested Border Protection Command  to release the Dash 8 to search this new potential area.  By this  stage the Dash 8 was low on fuel, and had very limited capacity  for ongoing search and rescue activity.  The Dash 8 returned to  Christmas Island. Due to fuel, weather and crew duty  limitations it was unable to relaunch last night to support that  request.

RCC Australia also provided BASARNAS with updated

information based on drift modelling for the vessel yesterday  afternoon, and tasked the merchant vessel that I've referred to  earlier, APL Bahrain, to respond to this broadcast, to respond  to the potential area where the vessel might now be, based on  that drift modelling analysis, and head to that new area.

The merchant vessel Bahrain headed to that area and arrived

in that area at nine o'clock last night.  It searched throughout  the night, and at 3:30 this morning sighted people in the  water.  As I've said, the latest advice is that APL Bahrain has  recovered six people from the water, but there are grave fears  for a lot more.  The advice that we have is that there were up to  one-hundred-and-fifty people that were aboard this vessel.

Six have been plucked from the sea.  We have grave fears

for a lot more.  There is a massive search and rescue effort  going on right now just off the coast of Indonesia.  It involves up  to seven vessels and one Air Force aircraft.  The search and  rescue effort is being led by the Indonesian search and rescue  authority BASARNAS, but we are providing every assistance  we can.

That's the latest information that I have.  Very happy to take  your questions.

REPORTER:         Is the Federal Government happy or satisfied, rather, with the  way that Indonesian authorities handled the situation?

JASON CLARE:   Let's remember just how difficult this task is.  This is a big  stretch of water.  Search and rescue is very hard.  It's very hard  to find people that are in distress on a little wooden boat in the  middle of the Sunda Strait, or anywhere between Christmas  Island and the coast of Indonesia.  The Indonesian authorities  deployed assets to try to find these people.

We've worked very closely with Indonesian authorities to try

and find these people as well.  You do this by working together,  and by using the information that we had to help identify where  this vessel might be.  We've been able to find the vessel, but  it's a matter of working together and we do this with the  Indonesian search and rescue authority all the time.

REPORTER:         Minister, what do you know of why the Indonesians did stop  searching so early on?

JASON CLARE:   I wouldn't use the term, so early on.  The Indonesians deployed  two helicopters and two vessels.  They searched over that  search and rescue area where the phone call indicated the  vessel in distress might be.  I think they did that for quite a  considerable period of time.  The Indonesians led the search  and rescue effort, searched the area, tried to find people, but  couldn't do it.

Don't underestimate how difficult this task is.  Don't  underestimate how big the sea that we're searching is.  When  people get on a boat that's leaking, where the engine doesn't  work, and water is coming on board it's very, very dangerous,  and finding people in the middle of the sea is very, very hard.  Indonesian authorities worked very hard yesterday to find these  people. We're working hard right now to save as many people  as we can, and we're doing that with Indonesian authorities  right now.

REPORTER:         The crucial hours were lost, weren't they?

JASON CLARE:   I wouldn't say that. From the time that we received a phone call  with a location Australian authorities and Indonesian authorities  have been working as hard as they possibly can to find these  people. Don't underestimate how hard it is to find people in the  middle of the sea. It's very, very hard , and the authorities have  been working since the time they got the original information  early yesterday morning.

REPORTER:         Do you know where the asylum seekers are from originally?

JASON CLARE:   We don't have confirmed information about that at the  moment.  We'll be able to get more information from the  survivors who are now on the merchant vessel throughout the  course of the day, so I'll wait until I've got confirmed information  before I pass that on.

REPORTER:         And Minister, do you know how many children are actually on  board?

JASON CLARE:   We don't have confirmed details of that.  When the phone call  was made yesterday morning the person on the boat indicated  there were about one-hundred-and-fifty people on board, and  that included women and children, but we don't have the details  at this time about how many women and how many children.

REPORTER:         Minister, do you know where the asylum seekers will be taken?

JASON CLARE:   Given that this is so close to Indonesia it's my expectation that  the survivors will be taken to Indonesia.

REPORTER:         And the six survivors, can you tell us what condition they're in?

JASON CLARE:   No, it's too early.  Just remember the sun is just coming up off  the coast of Indonesia right now.  They've been plucked out of  the ocean in the middle of the night.  We'll get more information  from the master of the vessel through the course of the  day.  You can expect that they've suffered an incredible  trauma.  Six people have survived.  Potentially dozens and  dozens of people haven't.

REPORTER:         Men, women and children, what is the make-up of the six  survivors currently on the Bahrain?

JASON CLARE:   My understanding - and this information has not been  confirmed yet - is that they are all men.

REPORTER:         And how long will Australia be assisting with the search  operation?

JASON CLARE:   Well, we're under the direction at the moment of BASARNAS,  which is leading the search and rescue effort.  We'll provide all  the assistance that's required of us.  I expect that Australians  will do what we'll always do, which is search to find life while  ever we think the chance of people being alive exists.

REPORTER:         Minister, obviously this boat only left Indonesia or wherever it  came from relatively recently.  How long do you expect it to  take for the policy shift to off-shore processing to work to deter  people smugglers?

JASON CLARE:   Let there be no mistake about this - people smugglers are  trying to get people onto boats. They're trying to push as many  people onto boats as they can. We've seen evidence of that  over the course of the last few weeks. They want to make as  much money out of this as they possibly can. Remember they  make as much as a million dollars out of every boat that they  set to sea, and they're lying to people. They're telling people  they're selling them a ticket to Australia - what they're really  doing is selling them a ticket to Nauru, or a ticket to the bottom  of the sea.

I expect people smugglers to keep trying to keep trying to put

people onto boats. The real risk here is that people never make  it to Australia, they end up dying trying to get to Australia.

We've seen too much evidence of that in last few months. More  than three hundred people have died in the last three months,  and it appears more people have died in the last twenty-four  hours.

REPORTER:         So then the policy shift - it follows that the policy shift is  ineffective as long as people smugglers continue to lie to their  customers?

JASON CLARE:   No, I didn't say that. There are eighty-five Australian defence  personnel on the ground in Nauru right now. They'll be one-hundred-and-fifty Australian defence personnel on the ground  by then end of the day. We're setting up that facility right now.  We want it in place as soon as possible. We need to implement  all of the recommendations of the Houston report as soon as  possible, and that is just one of them, but it's a very important  one. That's why we're working as quickly as we possibly can to  set up the off-shore processing facility in Nauru.

REPORTER:         So are you concerned that the message isn't getting through to  asylum seekers, to the people it needs to get through to?

JASON CLARE:   I would expect that people smugglers will try and get people  onto boats. Remember, there are a lot of people who have paid  half their money already. They've paid half the money for the  trip before they get on the boat, and sometimes pay half of it  when they arrive in Australia. This is a ten thousand dollar  ticket to Australia. For a lot of people that have set off from their  country of origin and in Indonesia now, there are some that will  try their luck.

My message is, don't get on the boat. Don't get on the boat

because what we've seen today is that there is a real risk that  people will die, that people will end up at the bottom of the sea.

REPORTER:         Are you concerned this is a last minute rush?

JASON CLARE:   I've been saying now for about six months that people  smugglers are running a closing down sale. They're telling  people, get on the boat before there's no more chance to come  to Australia. That's been happening now for a number of  months. I think the legislation that's passed through the  parliament to set up off-shore processing only encourages  people smugglers to try and get people onto boats as quickly  as they can because they know that setting up off-shore  processing in Nauru, in Manus Island, and potentially the

implementation of all of the recommendations of the Houston  expert report will shut down their business model.

REPORTER:         So what's Nauru [unclear] the boat people expected to slow  down the boats?

JASON CLARE:   It's an important part of it. It's a very important part of it, but as I  said earlier we need to implement all the recommendations of  the Houston report.

REPORTER:         When is Nauru going to open?

JASON CLARE:   I'll refer you to the comments that Minister Bowen last week.  He said he expects to have a facility for up to five hundred  people by the end of September.

REPORTER:         Minister, on another issue, the ADF has just confirmed that  three Australians have been killed in Afghanistan, [unclear]  country.

JASON CLARE:   I understand that the Australian Defence Force has issued a  statement only moments ago. There are certain protocols in  place that need to be followed, and fully implemented over the  course of the next few hours. It's important that I adhere to  those protocols, so I won't be making any further comment at  this moment, but other than to say that Vice-Chief of the  Defence Force will be making a statement a little later today.

REPORTER:         Minister, just back to the search, has there been any sighting of  any bodies?

JASON CLARE:   Nothing confirmed. As I said earlier, information changes. We  get more information by the minute. I am not in a position at the  moment to confirm that there have been bodies identified in the  water, but just make the general point the expectation is there  are one-hundred-and-fifty people on this boat, six people have  been plucked from the sea, we hold grave fears for many more.

REPORTER:         What would be the role of HMAS Maitland?

JASON CLARE:   Its role is to look for survivors, to try and pluck as many people  from the sea as we can. We have a window of opportunity -  people can survive in the sea for up to thirty-six, maybe forty-eight hours. That's why so many vessels, merchant vessels,  Indonesian vessels, and Australian vessels are heading to the  scene to try and rescue as many people as we can, to try and  save as many lives as we can.

Thanks very much.
