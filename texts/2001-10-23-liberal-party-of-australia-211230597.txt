SCIACCA CONTRADICTS BEAZLEY ON ASYLUM SEEKERS

Labor’s  immigration  spokesman  Con  Sciacca  on  Melbourne  radio  this afternoon completely undermined his leader’s policy on asylum seekers.

Mr  Sciacca  stated  the  obvious.   He  acknowledged  there  was  no  guarantee that  a  Labor  government  would  have  greater  success  than  the  Coalition  in securing the agreement of the Indonesian government to prevent the exit of illegal asylum seekers from Indonesia.

This  burst  of  truth  from  Mr  Sciacca  confirms  what  I  have  said  for  weeks. Indonesia’s reluctance to reach an agreement to stop illegal asylum seekers coming to Australia has nothing to do with the political complexion of the Australian government.

Mr Beazley’s ridiculous claims that a change to a Labor government here in Australia would induce a different response from the Indonesians has been exposed for the fallacy that it is.
