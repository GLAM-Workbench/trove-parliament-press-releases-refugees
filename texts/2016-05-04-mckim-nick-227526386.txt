4 May, 2016

The Government’s decision not to restore cuts to Legal Aid and Community Legal Centres  (CLCs) in yesterday’s budget will continue to deny access to justice for some of the most  vulnerable members of the community, Greens spokesperson for Justice Nick McKim says.

“Yet again, the Government has ignored those most in need to look after corporations and the  very wealthy,” Senator McKim said.

“CLCs are facing a $34.8 million funding cut between 2017 and 2020, meaning tens of  thousands of people in need of assistance will be turned away.”

“Those that will suffer include families in crisis, women escaping domestic violence and those  seeking assistance on welfare rights, immigration and refugee applications.”

“The government has ignored its own Productivity Commission which has recommended  significant increases in funding for Legal Aid and CLCs to help reduce pressure on a court  system already under significant strain”

“The government’s failure to restore this funding is false economy as the burden will shift to  other areas of the budget, such as health and human services.”

“The Greens would have delivered a better budget that invested in Legal Aid and CLCs, and  provided fairer access to justice for more Australians.”
