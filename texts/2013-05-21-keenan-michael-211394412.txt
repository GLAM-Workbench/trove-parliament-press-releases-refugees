Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 104.1 Territory Talk Interview with Daryl  Manzie and Peter Perrin May 21, 2013

Topics: Labor’s Border Protection failures.

Peter Perrin

We have Michael Keenan here, the Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection and Natasha it is good to  see you again.

Natasha Griggs

It is lovely to see you too Pete.

Peter Perrin

First thing in the morning is always a bit of a rush isn’t it?

Daryl Manzie

It is mate but we manage to do it every morning you know.

Peter Perrin

Yeah but not with such esteemed guests.

Daryl Manzie

It is good to be able to welcome Michael here.

Michael Keenan

It is lovely to be here.

Daryl Manzie

Well the weather is warmer here Michael, you will enjoy it. You are here for a couple of reasons, I guess the main one is you  have a conference or what would you call it? A public meeting?

Michael Keenan

It is a public meeting at 10.30. Natasha has invited me up here to talk to local people about their law and order concerns. I  believe it is the Lyons Community centre.

Natasha Griggs

That is right and we have also invited along John Elferink, the local Attorney General, because inevitably when we have  forums people do get confused between what is a Federal issue and what is a Territory issue.

Daryl Manzie

I was about to say that because about 90 per cent of the things that people are concerned about are actually local issues but  the Federal Government also has a capacity to provide support for certain initiatives that relate to local issues.

Peter Perrin

So there is a cross over there.

Daryl Manzie

Well the Feds collect all the money.

Michael Keenan

That is exactly right. We are looking for ways that we can help the Northern Territory Government to help pursue what is their  responsibility.  But the Commonwealth is the biggest government in Australia and you are right in saying it has the most  money and we want to find ways that we can use the weight and the heft of the Commonwealth to help. That is why Natasha  asked me up here today.

Peter Perrin

What is your main focus Michael as the Opposition or Shadow Minister in this area? Things like border protection?

Michael Keenan

Border Protection is absolutely one of our primary focuses and that means controlling the illegal boats that are coming here  but also making sure, particularly in the law and order area, that we are stopping guns and drugs and all the things that we  don’t want to see on our streets.

Peter Perrin

There was a big forum on that yesterday.

Michael Keenan

Absolutely and that is also part of Australia’s problem at the moment where we have an agency, Customs, that has been  savagely attacked by the Labor Party. They have had both their funding and personnel reduced. They are dealing with the  crisis on our borders, in dealing with illegal boat arrivals, but they are also struggling to stop the sort of contraband that we  don’t want to see on our streets coming into Australia.

Daryl Manzie

I guess one of our problems with dealing with our borders is across the north it is just wide open. When asylum seekers, who  are looking for the navy to grab them once they are at the 200km limit, they can’t be detected and they sort of wash up on the  shore. You just have to wonder how easy is it for someone who is deliberately trying to avoid surveillance and trying to bring  product ashore. Just how open are our borders and is there any indication that there is actually people doing that?

Michael Keenan

We do have a very effective system of border protection and the agency that is responsible for it is actually very good. The  problem they have got at the moment is the sheer scale of the amount of boats that are coming to Australia and it is literally  impossible for them, with the resources at their disposal, to deal with this wave of illegal arrivals. We have never seen  numbers like this before in our history.

Peter Perrin

I think was it last week there were 2000 people arrived? No sorry it was since the beginning of the month.

Michael Keenan

It was since the beginning of the month and of course we are only two thirds of the way through the month. Also six of those  boats have been brought directly to Darwin as well when of course we are supposed to be sending people for offshore  processing via Christmas Island but that is just not happening. The scale of what is happening at the moment just dwarfs,  even under this Government, the scale of what is happening in the last two months dwarfs what has been happening in any  other year and we are just staggered by the rate of illegal arrivals that are coming down here.

Peter Perrin

Well Daryl you were in Bali on holidays and I believe the Indonesian police arrested a boat in the harbour there.

Daryl Manzie

That’s right. They were on their way here thanks to the people smugglers.

Michael Keenan

You have to leave the people smugglers in absolutely no doubt that you are serious about stopping them.

Daryl Manzie

So temporary visas has obviously got to be the first step in that if people do get here because then when the opportunity  arises and things have improved in the country where they came from then it gives the opportunity to send them back home.

Michael Keenan

That is right. Temporary protection visas are very important because it stops the product that the people smugglers are  selling, which is permanent residence to Australia, but we will also make sure that people don’t set foot on mainland Australia.  When we talk about offshore processing we mean it. We will also turn boats back around when it is safe to do so, which is  something the Australian navy is very capable of doing. Those suite of measures will work very effectively to send the  message that one the administration has changed, if we win the election, and two this new administration is really serious  about stopping people smuggling and that will be a very important message for us to get out there.

Daryl Manzie

Natasha will tell you that there is a lot of concern amongst a lot of people here, not just the fact that people are coming here  illegally but that we feel that the border to the north is not being looked after as well as it could be and that is a concern for a  lot of people.

Michael Keenan

Natasha raises it with me very regularly and Natasha and I actually spoke in a parliamentary debate about this together last  week. I am from Western Australia so I understand the concerns but of course we are finding at the moment that boats are  coming much closer to Darwin and clearly they are targeting the Territory. They are doing that because there were  advantages to arriving on the Australian mainland as opposed to being picked up at Cocos or Christmas Islands and for some  unknown reason the Government refused to pass legislation to excise the mainland, that got rid of that incentive. If you look at  a map of where boats are being intercepted you can see them bearing down, literally on Darwin, so that is where they are  targeting at the moment because of that incentive to get to the mainland.

Daryl Manzie

I am just going to change subject now onto something a bit out of left field but alcohol abuse is a massive problem Australia  wide especially with young people. I don’t think it matters where you are, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, the Territory, the outback  of the Territory, alcohol abuse is a major issue. The Commonwealth now has all the taxing powers that relate to alcohol. Has  there been any discussion about looking at modifying taxation to provide I guess a lower rate for lower alcohol beverages like  beers or things like that? Has that ever been discussed? It worked very successfully here in the 1990’s.

Michael Keenan

That is not within my portfolio area so I don’t really know whether we have had those discussions to be honest with you.  Perhaps Natasha knows.

Natasha Griggs

I think there has been some informal discussions Daryl but it hasn’t actually come to the Party Room for a big debate but  there are some people who are toying around with that idea and looking at what has worked in the past.

Daryl Manzie

I think it was about the only thing that positively worked but it really is a massive problem that is the base for most of the crime  and most of the imprisonment. It is something that is not just here.  It is all over the country and we really need to look at how

we turn that around.

Natasha Griggs

You are right Daryl and as you know I am on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Standing Committee and one of the  points that is made, that I make regularly, is that although there is a lot of discussion about alcohol in the communities, there  is the same level or probably even more level of abuse in our suburbs ,whether it is in the Territory or Western Australia or  New South Wales, but it is very easy to spotlight onto the Indigenous communities. We had a roundtable yesterday and some  of these issues were raised with Michael so that Michael could get a good picture of this and take that back to his colleagues.

Daryl Manzie

One of the stats with Indigenous drinking of course is that only 20 per cent of Indigenous people drink alcohol in the Territory  but gee wiz they really give it a thrashing and they are the ones who are seen and are visible.

Peter Perrin

Must be tough being in Federal politics and working out of Western Australia though Michael because I think I saw you the  other day on Sky News, on a program that probably had you there at about four o’clock in the morning.

Michael Keenan

I appreciate you raising that. The media cycle does run three hours ahead in the Eastern states and it does start very early but look complaining about doing early media or flying a lot is pointless when it is really just part of the job and if you don’t want to  do it then find something else to do.

Peter Perrin

When I saw your appearance on the program, I think it was Sunday Agenda that you were on, was once again a very firm  message that we are going to stop the boats from coming down here and I suppose the thing that we have to remember is  that with the way technology is today people can hear us all over the world, including where these boats are originating from.  And I should imagine that the people who are organising the boats to come down here are quite technologically savvy so they  are going to hear these messages on satellite television, they will hear them on internet radio and the message that you put  across the other day was pretty firm.

Michael Keenan

That is a good point. These are very sophisticated criminals and they are making enormous sums of money and they are fully  versed in what goes on in Australia. They will know that the government has changed and they will know that the government  is pursuing new policies in the same way that they responded to the Labor Party when the government changed and the  Labor Party weakened the system of border protection and literally a month later the boats started again. They completely  understand what is happening in Australia and they factor that into the way they run their business and they need to be in no  doubt, and we say this all the time, that we will stop them. That is a very important message for them to hear. We are setting  the bar very high for ourselves and it will be very easy for the Australian people to judge whether we have succeeded or not  but we will do whatever is necessary to stop that evil trade.

Daryl Manzie

Just one last thing. We are talking about the border issues. The Federal Government Minister Bob Carr has been quite out  there talking to our neighbours saying that you have got to invest more in policing border protection yet the Australian  Government has reduced staffing of Federal Police in Jakarta. Is there any connection between what the Federal Police do in  Jakarta and people smuggling?

Michael Keenan

Natasha and I were just discussing this yesterday. This is just an extraordinary decision. The Australian Federal Police have a  very successful liaison with their Indonesian counterparts in tackling people smuggling and because of budget cuts that have  hit the Federal Police very severely they have reduced those numbers of Federal Police by 40 per cent in Jakarta, which is  just one of the most extraordinary and silly decisions I have seen out of this Government. We do work very closely with  Indonesia on these matters.

Daryl Manzie

Well there are two issues aren’t there, border protection and terrorism?

Michael Keenan

Absolutely and the AFP has a very long history of engaging with their Indonesian counterparts very successfully and to reduce that presence is, I am not sure I can describe it as anything less than completely bonkers.

Daryl Manzie

Bob Carr is pretty good at saying one thing and doing something else.

Natasha Griggs

Just like the rest of his Labor colleagues.

Michael Keenan

That is true.

Peter Perrin

Michael thanks very much for your time this morning.

Michael Keenan

It is my great pleasure.
