LAUNCH OF THE THINKUKNOW INITIATIVE

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

It is good to be here today in Ithaca Creek State School in Brisbane, with the Member for Brisbane  Arch Bevis, with the Australian Federal Police commissioner Tony Negus and representatives from  Microsoft Australia and Nine MSN in what is the launch of a very important initiative in protecting  our children on line.

This initiative, ThinkUKnow, allows for parents, teachers and carers to be better informed about the  dangers of the internet. This is a national initiative. This will be rolled out across the country  providing an opportunity for those who provide care to children—whether they are parents, teachers  or other carers—to learn more about the internet, to find out more about the potential dangers such  as grooming and other threats that are out there. As we know, while the internet is a very important  educational tool, while it’s a great source of entertainment for people, including for children, it also  has potential risks—it is not a benign playground. For that reason we have to be ever vigilant.

That is why to Federal Government is behind this initiative. The ThinkUKnow initiative  complements the recent legislation that we have introduced into the House of Representatives to  protect children from predators and, in particular, to protect them from predators who use the  internet for improper and illegal purposes.

I would like to thank the Australian Federal Police, Microsoft Australia and NineMSN who, of  course, through their combined good work, will ensure that we get this message out.

QUESTION

Will this latest too raise public awareness?  Is that what it is all about?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

I think education is very important. What we do know is that parents and children do not always  discuss every matter. We are aware that children sometimes go how from school, go straight to their  bedroom, get onto the Internet—that’s not an unhealthy thing in itself. However, if they are not  talking to their parents or their carers about potential problems or things that cause them discomfort  on the Internet, then they are being placed in danger.  The more that parents, teachers and carers  know about the Internet, the more they engage with children about how they use the Internet, the  safer our children will be.

QUESTION

Are parents in the dark a lot? Are they a different generation and failing to understand what the  Internet really involves?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

Clearly, children understand the on-line world better than many parents. That is not to say that there  are not parents who have a good grasp of the Internet. There are many adults who are required to use  the Internet as part of their day-to-day work life, and there are many who are on the Internet as part  of their social life. It is true, though; that there will be circumstances in which children will be  engaging in activity which the parents do not know about. If we open up the dialogue—if we ensure  that the ThinkUKnow seminar, and the use of the website, provides an opportunity to raise  awareness and to encourage greater engagement with children about their activities on the Internet— we can reduce the likelihood of them coming to harm. We can better protect our children.

QUESTION

Will this be rolled on in all schools across the country?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

We are going to ensure that schools engage with this. It is a voluntary process; we have a number of  trained volunteers who can provide seminars in schools. We have significant resources to put to this  activity. It will, of course, be driven, in part by the level of demand that comes from the community.  As we can see with this very good school, they understand the importance of this initiative. I am sure  that other schools in Brisbane, in Queensland and across the rest of Australia will want to get  involved.

QUESTION

Are mums and dads at home able to access this program?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

That’s the other beauty of this initiative. Not only do we have seminars that will be held in schools  by trained volunteers talking about the potential risks of the technology, but we also have a user-friendly website that will allow for on-line seminars for those parents and carers who are not in a  position to attend school-based seminars.

QUESTION

Did the trial tell us anything about the initiative?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

It is a very effective program. We piloted the program early last year. When it was completed we  surveyed those who had participated. 96 per cent of those adults who had completed the program  agreed that they knew more about the potential risks of the Internet than before they had commenced  the program. They felt better placed to protect their children from the dangers of the Internet. From

3

the results of the trial and the survey it was clear that the government, the AFP, Microsoft and  NineMSN had to do more. That’s why we are launching this initiative today.

Question

How is this initiative aligned with other programs intended to protect children?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

We have made it very clear that we need to take a whole-of-government approach to protecting our  children. That is why we have toughened the offences for those who use the Internet  to prey on  children. There will be new offences and we have also increased the penalties for those people who  engage in predatory behaviour. That bill is before the House, we hope that the opposition supports  this very important legislation. We have a number of ways to protect our kids, we can not, and do  not, rely upon one initiative to protect our kids. The ThinkUKnow initiative is one part of a suite of  initiatives.

QUESTION

Is this the first school to take part in the initiative.

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

Ithaca Creek State School is indeed to first school to take part in the formal program. There have  been other schools involved in the trial program. We are here today though, to launch the program, a  very important national program.

QUESTION

How soon we this be available in schools across Australia?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

As I have said, this is day one. We will expect to see other schools getting involved very shortly.  Through the efforts of the AFP and Microsoft Australia and Nine MSN, this is going to be promoted  very widely. We want to have as many schools involved in this program as quickly as possible.  There is nothing more important that protecting our children and this program is a very important  initiative in that regard.

QUESTION

On a different matter if I may Minister. There has been another boat load of asylum seekers. ASIO is  tipped to get its charter expanded so that it can phone tap people smugglers. Is this something that  will be done soon? And, what other measures will the government be implementing to stop people

smugglers?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

It is true that there has been another vessel that has been intercepted 22 nautical miles north of the  Ashmore Islands late yesterday. That vessel is being taken to Christmas Island where the passengers  will be assessed medically and, indeed, the security checks will be done, and their identity checked  as well. That is the process we have taken and we will continue to do that. But what we do know of  course is that there has been a thirty percent increase in the refugee population in the world since  2006. There are 42 million displaced persons. We are going to see, from time to time, surges in  irregular arrivals. What we are seeing now is a surge, not as great a surge as occurred under the  Howard Government. It is though, a challenge, a practical challenge for our customs and border  protection personnel. We will continue to be vigilant to ensure that we do everything we can to  dismantle the organised syndicates that are seeking to entice people onto what are, in many cases,  dangerous vessels. The Australian Federal Police is working, for example, the Indonesian National

4

Police, in dismantling syndicates and disrupting ventures in Indonesia, a transit country. We are  working closely with Malaysia to ensure that they have laws to prosecute people smugglers. We are  providing advice to Sri Lanka in having laws that are similar to our own in prosecuting people

smugglers. Since September 2008 we have had more prosecutions of people smugglers than we have  had in many a year.

In relation to anything that the intelligence agencies may be wanting to do; that’s not something that  I can comment on. There are always considerations by agencies as to what we might do to prevent  crime occurring, but there is no formal decision or determination regarding ASIO that I am aware of

in that regard.

QUESTION

The Opposition say that they have been briefed on this and it is something that the government is  considering—ASIO, wanting to phone tap people smugglers in Australia.

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

Well. The opposition should know—and I should say that this underlines the danger of electing an  Abbott government—the opposition should know when they are briefed on national security matters  their first phone call shouldn’t be to the media. These are matters related to very significant and

sensitive issues. We are always considering what more we can do to protect our borders, to protect  the integrity of out immigration system. What we don’t need is an irresponsible opposition seeking  to get media stories up on very important issues. We will determine what we need to do, if we need  to do more, but we will do so sensitively. And when we have made a decision will, of course,  announce that publicly.

QUESTION

What impact will this arrival have on Christmas Island—the capacity of Christmas Island?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR

There has been a significant increase in arrivals over the last nine months. We still, though, have  capacity on Christmas Island and we are expanding accommodation there, as Minister Evans has  made clear.  At this point we can maintain the processing of asylum claims on Christmas Island and  that is what we are committed to.

Thank you everyone.



… ENDS.
