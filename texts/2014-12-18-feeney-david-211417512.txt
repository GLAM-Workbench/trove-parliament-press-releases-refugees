SUBJECT/ S: Sydney siege; NSW bail law s; Commonw ealth and NSW  inquiry; M eta data legislation; Submarines.

KEIREN GILBERT: And joining me now on the program, the Shadow Justice  Minister, David Feeney, and also Parliamentary Secretary for Communications  Paul Fletcher. Gentleman good morning to you, as know the questions are being  asked David Feeney. I guess one thing that was glaring yesterday was this  disparity between what the Prime Minister had said, in terms of this gunman  having a gun, and being on the gun register, whereas the New South Wales  authority said that wasn’t the case, well what is your reaction to that?

DAVID FEENEY, SHADOW ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE: Well I  guess that is just one of several questions that lurk in the background of this  very powerful moment for Sydney and this very horrifying event for Australia.  We have seen the Prime Minister and the New South Wales government say a  number of different things here, and the Prime Minister has now obviously called  for a joint report from the two. I think that will go to a number of issues around  the justice system as well as some of the operational decisions made around the  siege, and the fact that the Prime Minister and the NSW government seem to

have different advice and different information, I guess points to the fact that  there are some questions for that review to look at.

GILBERT: And Paul Fletcher I guess further to that is the fact that this should  seem a pretty easy question to answer, whether or not someone is on the gun  register or not?

PAUL FLETCHER, PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE  COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER: Well, as the Prime Minister’s office said  yesterday, in the statement, the Prime Minister made that statement based upon  advice provided to him from commonwealth officials, and they were drawing in  turn on information contained in what is called the national police reference  system, but certainly the purpose of the joint review, announced by the Prime  Minister and the Premier of NSW, and to be lead jointly by the secretary of the  Commonwealth department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the state  department of Premier and Cabinet, so the two most senior public servants in  the Commonwealth system, and in NSW. That review has a range of questions to  look at, including questions about how it was that Man Horan Monis was granted  a refugee status in the first place, his citizenship status, and a whole range of  other issues, including obviously operational coordination issues, and that’s one  of many issues that its quite proper, and appropriate, and it should be  thoroughly reviewed in the after math of this appalling siege, so that we can at  both state and federal level do the best possible job at providing the protection  that citizens expect.

GILBERT: David Feeney, as the Shadow Justice Minister, any reflections, and  thoughts on the issue of bail, and bail laws, I know the DPP, I put this to the  Premier just a short time ago, that the DPP in NSW have launched a review of all  bail decisions in NSW and in the wake of events of this week.

FEENEY: I think that review is appropriate, obviously people have said, quite  reasonably that it is completely unacceptable that somebody who had come to  the attention of our law enforcement authorities for such a long period of time,  and around such serious charges was nonetheless at liberty and able to commit  this terrible atrocity in the city of Sydney. Any reasonable person looking at this  and looking at these events would say that’s not an acceptable set of  circumstances, and that the bail system has failed, failed the people of New  South Wales and indeed failed Australia more broadly. I think it is very  reasonable that we ask questions, and in the New South Wales jurisdiction that  the Attorney-General and New South Wales Government take on very seriously  the task of reviewing the bail system, and making sure that it is operating to best  effect, and getting the balance right between incarcerating people, and making  sure that the community is safe.

GILBERT: And you would agree with all of that wouldn’t you Paul Fletcher, as a  Sydneysider yourself, knowing this area all too well, and the impact on your city,  your state?

FLETCHER: Well obviously like everybody who lives in Sydney, has worked in  business or been a lawyer as I have, it’s a part of the city that I am extremely  familiar with. Obviously a number of members of the legal profession, and many  other members of the community, and it’s the nature of our society, that all of us  can feel a connection, and in some cases, and more generally with those who  were in the cafÃÂ© enduring that horrible, horrible experience, and I think that’s  why we are seeing such a strong community response, I think one of the aspects  of the very powerful community response is firstly a deep and instinctive  response of sympathy and compassion and support. But secondly, I think a very  strong expression of support for our successful, our extremely successful  multicultural, multiethnic society, with over 25 per cent of adult Australians born  in another country, we are one of the most diverse societies in the world.  Yesterday, and this week in fact I have been at a number of school presentation  days in my electorate, as in just many electorates in Australia, multi-ethnic  communities represented in schools, and I was thinking about the wonderful jobs  that our schools do in helping build a cohesive society, and while naturally we  should take all of the appropriate steps to respond to this terrible occurrence,  and get the right policy response, we should also remember the success we have  had, and we are having as a multicultural and multiethnic nation. And I do think  that part of the very strong community response in validation and support for  that great success we have had, and a strong resistance to anything that might  threaten that.

GILBERT: Indeed, no disagreement there. I just want to finish before we go to  a break, your view on, and of course it’s still very raw all of this, and the reviews  are going to look into the response was undertaken, but I guess David Feeney,  one of the questions that has been asked, is why weren’t the SAS for example,  deployed into this situation, what is your view on the way that that was  managed, we do have an SAS component as I understand, at Holsworthy, that  has snipers or a greater capacity to deal with that sort of situation, do you have  any thoughts on that?

FEENEY: Well you are right. The Australian Defence Force does have Special  Forces that are able to provide an Emergency Response Force for these kind of  events. But ultimately that is an operational decision that is made by the lead  agency, and in this case that would have been the New South Wales Police. And  so the New South Wales Police would have been well aware that they had that  resource, and other resources to draw upon if they were needed. So I think that  is the type of speculation that probably doesn’t help, but it is the kind of question  that the review, undertaken by the Commonwealth and the New South Wales

Governments does need to turn its mind to. Were there any resources or any  capabilities that the siege needed, that they didn’t have? That is a fair and  reasonable question. Those resources might have come from the ADF, but really  they could have come from many of our security and defence intelligence  agencies. So making sure that the agency coordination is as strong as it can be  should be an important focus of that review. The fact that the Prime Minister was  advised about a gun license, and there is now a question over that gun license, I  guess points to the fact that the coordination can never be taken for granted.  There needs to be a fusion of all available information and that needs to happen  straight away.

GILBERT: Absolutely, yes that is valid point given that disparity between the  two bits of advice that the Premier and the Prime Minister put yesterday. We will  have more after the break on AM Agenda, stay with us.

Commercial break

GILBERT: This is AM Agenda, thanks for very much for your company, with me  this morning Paul Fletcher and David Feeney. Paul Fletcher as the Parliamentary  Secretary to the Communications Minister, and I would like the question you  about the meta-data issue in relation to the Counter-Terrorism laws. Yesterday,  the ASIO representative told the Parliamentary Committee that metadata can be  used in civil cases, i.e. in relation to internet piracy and so on that the Minister  had previously said no it wouldn’t be used, in the case of piracy, and that sort of  situation, which is it, can you clarify that for us?

FLETCHER: Well the situation in relation to meta data laws is that under the law  as it presently stands where meta data has been retained by a tell-co or an  internet service provider for its business purposes, then there is the capacity for  the federal police and other agencies to lodge a request for that information,  under the telecommunications intercept and access Act. Now there is legislation  currently before the Parliament, which is now being examined by this committee,  which was holding hearings yesterday I believe, which is looking at the question,  or the legislation is proposing there be a period under which there’s a retention,  a greater retention of that data, and so that that would be a legislative  requirement to retain the data, at the moment as I say the law is that the  carriers are not under any legislative obligation to retain metadata. Just to be  clear, metadata is things like the number of the calls originated from; the  number it is going to, and in the case of an internet browsing session, things like  the originating IP address, and so on. Now that’s the issue that the committee is  working through, the Senate committee is working through. That will make a set  of recommendations, and the Government will then consider those in the context  of the legislation.

GILBERT: But can it be used for people downloading illegally, and that sort of  thing?

FLETCHER: Well the point I make to you is that that legislation is not looking at  changing the circumstances in which those powers can be exercised. So it is not  looking at changing the nature of the maters for which the agencies have the  power to seek information it’s looking at the obligations on the carriers, and the  internet service providers, in relation to the obligation to retain meta-data.

GILBERT: Alright, I just want to finish on the submarine issue with David  Feeney. Suggestions on the Adelaide Advertiser that the German defence  company that has been speculated on as a possible construction partner in this,  it might actually want an equity share of the Australian Submarine Corporation,  what is your view on this story this morning?

FEENEY: Well I hope that last answer cleared up all of your meta data questions  there Kieran. Listen, this has been an interesting development, and we have  seen this unfold for a little while in the submarine debate. You will remember  when the Government first flagged the idea of buying submarines from Japan,  one of the reasons it advanced for that, is that Australian shipyards would not be  able to build submarines at a competitive price. Between 20 and 24 billion dollars  is where this thing needs to land, and the Government at that point said  Australian shipyards couldn’t do better than 40 billion, or even 80 billion. Very  quickly after that development we saw this German company, ThyssenKrupp  Marine Systems, say that in fact they could build them, they could build them in  Australia, they could build them on time, and they could build them on budget. I  think it is fair to say the Germans have a pretty strong record in the field of  building submarines. The idea that they would come to Australia and make that  investment, and perhaps reorganise, and change the ownership arrangements  around our shipyards I think is absolutely worth exploring. It is another option  for this Government rather than simply destroying the Australian shipbuilding  and submarine industry, and heading overseas.

GILBERT: Gents we are out of time, David Feeney, Paul Fletcher thank you for  your time this morning. A quick break on AM Agenda, back in just a moment.
