MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER FA148 27 September 2001

DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO LEBANON

I  have  today  announced  the  appointment  of  Ms  Stephanie  Anna  Shwabsky  as  Australian Ambassador to Lebanon.  Ms Shwabsky will replace Mr John Fennessy, who has been Ambassador since April 1999.   Ms Shwabsky is expected to take up her appointment in February, 2002.

Australia has a long and close relationship with Lebanon, reflecting the deep community links that exist between our two countries.  The Lebanese community in Australia, which numbers more than 300,000, has made a profound and positive contribution to Australian society.

The  re-opening  of  Australia's  Embassy  in  1995  signalled  Australia's  confidence  in  the  future  of Lebanon.  Mr Ruddockâ€™s visit to Lebanon in January 2001 and my visit in April 2001, together with the visits to Australia by the Lebanese Minister for Transport and Public Works, Mr Najib Mikati, in March 2001 and by a delegation of members of the Lebanese Parliament in August 2001, have further strengthened bilateral relations.

Ms  Shwabsky is  a  senior  career  officer  with  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  and  is currently Counsellor, Deputy Head of Mission, Dili.  She transferred into the Department in 1982 from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet where she had been employed since 1974.   She has  served  as  Second  Secretary,  Bonn  (1984-87),  First  Secretary  and  Deputy  Head  of  Mission, Hanoi  (1987-89),  Deputy  Head  of  Mission,  Dhaka  (1990-92),  First  Secretary,  Deputy  Head  of Mission,  Colombo  (1993-94),  Counsellor,  Deputy  Head  of  Mission,  Nairobi  (1994),  and Counsellor, Deputy Head of Mission, Australian Embassy Phnom Penh, Cambodia (1996-99).

In  Canberra  Ms  Shwabsky  has  worked  in  the  Southern  Africa  Section  as  Director  (1989-90), Cambodia Task Force (1994-96) and in the East Timor Section (1999).  She has also served as a United  Nations  International  Polling  Station  Officer  for  the  Cambodian  Election  in  May  1993, United Nations Observer for the 1994 South African Election and as a Member of the Australian Observer Delegation, East Timor Popular Consultation, August 1999.

Ms Shwabsky has a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours from Sydney University.
