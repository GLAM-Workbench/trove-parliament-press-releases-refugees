E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



KING:  Minister Penny Wong, stepping In for Dr Craig Emerson. Senator, good morning.

WONG: Good morning to you.

KING:  And of course regular Liberal Senator George Brandis from the Opposition. Senator  Brandis, good morning to you too.

BRANDIS: Good morning Madonna, good morning Penny.

WONG: You’ll be pleased to know Madonna, we’re sitting very close together.

KING:  (laughs) And there hasn’t been a fight yet?

WONG: No, no. Could be nicer, or it could be grouchier.

KING:  We’ll see how it goes. And I’ll start with you George Brandis this morning. I see  you’ve taken to print in the Sydney Morning Herald to describe those targeting Muslims as  akin to the bullies you witnessed beating up Italian children when you were at school in the  1960s. Why the need to do that?

BRANDIS: Well I did write an opinion piece in this morning’s Sydney Morning Herald  because I think it’s very important that the Liberal Party restate emphatically - as Tony  Abbott and others have done in recent days - its very strong commitment to a multicultural  Australia.

Our attitude on this is shaped by three principles. First of all, we believe that Australia is  arguably the most successful immigrant society in the world, and that’s something we ought

2



to be very proud of. Secondly, that we are entirely committed to and are largely the  architects of the multicultural Australia that we all enjoy today. And thirdly, that we would  never countenance a discriminatory migration policy. Now there’s been some commentary  by the commentators challenging that. So I think we on the Opposition front bench are very  conscious of the need to state it and to be proud of it.

KING:  And does your Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison agree with those three  points?

BRANDIS: Absolutely.

KING: This is an issue in your party though, isn’t it? The fact that Tony Abbott had to  confirm the party’s policies were non-discriminatory; that you did support multiculturalism.

BRANDIS:  Well I think there were a couple of commentators seized upon remarks that  perhaps could have been better expressed or expressed at a different time last week.

KING: You mean Scott Morrison criticising the Government for paying for the funerals?

BRANDIS: Well I’m not going to be having a go at anyone.

KING:  No I don’t want you to have a go at anyone.  But I want you to be clear in what  you’re saying. You were speaking as much to your own party as anyone else in -

BRANDIS: No, I wasn’t. I was speaking to the people who read the article, or hear about it.  Because all of us in the Opposition are very concerned to affirm our steadfast and  unreserved support for multicultural Australia which we on our side of politics, have at least  as much credit as the Labor Party for being the architects of.

KING:  Penny Wong, do you accept that is what drove George Brandis?

WONG: First, I want to congratulate George for speaking out. I think this is precisely the  sort of bipartisanship multiculturalism should have.

Unfortunately, that’s not where we are now. And notwithstanding George’s very valiant  attempt to bridge the gap between what he said and what Mr Abbott has said, the reality is  we know that we’ve seen Mr Morrison make some very inappropriate comments,  regrettable comments. We’ve seen reports out of shadow cabinet that Mr Morrison is  suggesting that the Liberal Party should exploit concerns about Muslims. And we’ve also  seen Senator Cory Bernardi actually come out and say Islam is the problem.

Now these are not comments consistent with what George said today. They’re not  comments consistent with the bipartisan position that has previously been the case under  past Liberal governments. And really, I congratulate George, but the issue is not George’s  view in the paper today, the issue is what Mr Abbott is doing and not saying.

KING:  Can you clear this up -

BRANDIS: In fairness to me, yes I can and let me -

KING:  No, let me ask you the question before you answer it.

BRANDIS: Well I am entitled to correct a misstatement of fact. What has been attributed to  Mr Morrison by an anonymous leak is at variance from his views. So those reports were  effectively false.

KING:  Well let me ask you the question because I was going to ask you - can you say  unequivocally that Scott Morrison didn’t advocate to shadow cabinet that the Opposition  capitalise on community unrest over Muslims?

BRANDIS: Well I have a very strict rule about not revealing what is said in shadow cabinet  just as Penny would have in relation to Cabinet. But I can merely point to Mr Morrison’s  public statement that what was attributed to him does not represent his views. And I know  that to be true.

KING:  Just back to you Penny Wong. Just on this issue of how we feel or what kind of  unrest there is in the community. I see there is a survey out today that says half of  Australians harbour anti-Muslim sentiments and a quarter are anti-Semitic. This is the  biggest survey ever done in our country, a survey of 12,500 people. Do you think it is that  significant a problem?

WONG: I’m someone who was born overseas, I came to this country in 1977. So I know  first hand there are always some issues in a community when you have different waves of  migrants. This isn’t new. If you go back through Australian history in the post-war period,  we’ve had different waves of migrants from different parts of the world - Italians, Greeks in  the post-war period. We’ve had Vietnamese people from other parts of South-East Asia and  more recently obviously that has shifted, depending on where migration is coming from.

The issue is here, how do you deal with it as political leaders and as public leaders. And  there are times in politics where you really need to look to the national interest and put  aside any prospect of partisanship because the issue is too big.

KING:  Can I ask you George Brandis, do you agree with that; that this is one of those  things that there should be a bipartisan approach on our multiculturalism policy?

BRANDIS: Well I think there is.

WONG: That is just not true.

BRANDIS: That’s the very point I made in the article I published this morning. That  Australian multicultural policy has been the product of both the Liberal and Labor side of  politics since Harold Holt began to repeal the White Australia policy in the 1960s. And if  there is an intellectual architect of Australian multiculturalism, it’s probably Petro Georgiou  who as Malcolm Fraser’s adviser in the late 1970s and early 1980s, really was the architect  of that policy. Now -

WONG: But George you can’t justify current wrongs by looking at past goods, and that’s  what you’re trying to do. I accept the history, I accept there has been bipartisanship, but  let’s look at now. You have a shadow immigration minister seeking to exploit issues of  people going to funerals. You have a Senator who is Tony Abbott’s parliamentary secretary

4



saying Islam is the problem. You have your party adopting at least two policy issues which  were included in emails that One Nation put around. Now -

BRANDIS: Oh no, come on Penny -

WONG: No, it’s true.

BRANDIS: Penny, that is just not true.

WONG: Well it is true. There were calls from One Nation around the Muslim schools in  Indonesia which you cut funding to. There were calls through the internet around the issue  of asylum seekers being flown to funerals which you then responded to through the  comments of Scott Morrison.

BRANDIS: Do you know, Penny , do you know Penny -

WONG: Now George, I do think your views on this are probably not dissimilar to mine. And  I agree with you that in the past, we have seen a Liberal Party prepared to look to the  bigger national interest. What I’m saying to you now is this leader, Mr Abbott, and this  shadow minister Mr Morrison, and this leader’s parliamentary secretary, Senator Bernardi,  are not in that tradition.

BRANDIS: Penny, you are completely wrong. The views I’ve expressed are the very views  that Tony Abbott has consistently articulated throughout his career. If you read his book, if  you look at his public speeches, and as recently as the shadow cabinet on Monday, and the  parliamentary party meeting yesterday, the words I recited in response to Madonna’s  question, are the very words as Tony Abbott expressed them. So there is not an iota of  difference between my position and Tony Abbott’s position.

KING: Alright. OK -

BRANDIS: And as for this slur, that the Coalition is influenced by One Nation. You know  Penny,  the One Nation party believes that we should have a navy, the Labor Government  believes we should have a navy -

WONG: Oh come on -

BRANDIS: Does that mean your policy is dictated by One Nation?

KING:  Alright, I’m going to leave that conversation there because there are several other  issues I want to get onto. And you at home may have a view on that, if you do on either  party’s policies, make sure you give me a buzz after ten.

But just coming to something closer to home, while Christchurch continues to go through its  own emergency, people in Queensland are desperately trying to restart their lives. And  we’ve been talking about this for the last half hour. This flood levy from Canberra. Penny  Wong, where is it at?

WONG: Well the levy legislation, I understand, is still being debated in the House of  Representatives. I’ve been, like George, we’ve been in Senate Estimates, that rather

5



strange committee process the Senate has for very long hours. So I haven’t been following  the debate. But I have -

KING:  Alright. But do you have the support to pass it? And when will it be passed?

WONG: We believe that the independents and cross benches have heard very clearly the  Government’s position which is simply this:  we’ve got get this package through to give your  state, the people in it, the certainty they need to rebuild their communities and their homes.  That’s what we’re trying to do.

KING: We understand the argument but what we are trying to work out is Nick Xenophon  across the line, will it become law?

WONG: Look, Nick Xenophon - we’re still in discussions with Nick. I think he’s made his  view clear. We have to get one chamber at a time to vote for this so we’re trying to get it  through the House of Representatives. I think the discussions there have been very positive  and obviously we’ll continue the discussions with Senator Xenophon. We think there’s a lot  of merit here and we hope that commonsense will prevail.

KING: One of his conditions is that Queensland take out this insurance policy against the  state. Do either of you know whether that is feasible? Certainly from the state point of view,  state government ministers are arguing that given our road network, like Western Australia,  it might be impossible to find an insurer.

WONG: I think what Nick is saying - and I don’t want to, you know, sort of speak for him -  but what Nick is saying is the state should do it if it is feasible, if it’s commercially  reasonable to do so.

KING:  I’ve interviewed him and he thinks that, you know, that Queensland can do it.

WONG: And that’s his view. But I can tell you that my view would be you need to look at  what is reasonable for the state. I think the position Senator Xenophon has put is that he  thinks people should look at that and whether it’s reasonable to take out insurance and not  expect, simply expect the Commonwealth to pick up the tab.

Now obviously we’ve got to work through that with him in the interest of getting this package  up which is a $5.6 billion package.

KING:  George Brandis, I don’t want to go over the politics of the flood levy, but do you  have a view on whether Queensland can actually insure itself?

BRANDIS: Well I’m not a state politician and I adopt and support what Tim Nicholls has  said in relation to this matter. But I think it’s very interesting that the Under Treasurer,  Gerard Bradley who is of course a senior public servant, not a politician, but spoke on  behalf of the Queensland Government at a House of Representatives committee in  Canberra last week. And as I understood his evidence, he was saying that one of the  reasons the Queensland Government decided not to reinsure was because under the  Natural Disaster Plan, 75 per cent of the cost of recovery, costs of a natural disaster, would  be worn by the Commonwealth. And if that’s the reason, and that’s the principle reason,  then it doesn’t seem to be a very good reason.

KING:  On this issue more broadly, the importance of Nick Xenophon’s vote reminds  everyone just how precarious the numbers in Parliament are. While still with you George  Brandis, do you think the independents are being independent?

BRANDIS: Well certainly Mr Oakeshott isn’t being. I read in this morning’s paper the  reports that he’s decided that because he was criticised by the Opposition about something,  he’s not going to going to deal with the Opposition anymore. Now an independent who only  will deal with one side of Parliament, not the other side of Parliament, is no longer an  independent.

KING:  I read the same article I think. Didn’t he say he wouldn’t attend any more weekly  meetings with your leader because of the Coalition’s personal attacks?

BRANDIS: Well whatever he may have said, an independent who only deals with one side  of the chamber is an independent in name only.

KING: Do you go to those meetings or is it just Tony Abbott and the independents in the  meetings at this stage?

BRANDIS: I don’t attend those meetings. I think it’s Mr Abbott and perhaps a couple of his  senior staff or senior House of Representatives shadows.

KING:  Penny Wong, how would you describe the power of the independents? Do you think  they are wielding it fairly and independently, I guess?

WONG: Well the first thing I’d say just on that issue about Rob Oakeshott - I think it’s a  little unfair of the Coalition to have a go at him for saying, look if you’re not going to treat me  at least with some respect and appropriately, you know, I’m not going to keep engaging  with you. I think most people will think that’s a pretty reasonable call. It’s not about his  independence. It’s about how he views the way in which they’ve approached this.

On the independents - we are a government that has to deal with the independents in great  part because we have an Opposition that simply says no. Let’s remember if things were  agreed, if things were agreed between the Opposition and the Labor Party, then the  Government would not be in a position of having to negotiate with the independents. And  on some issues, one would have thought Mr Abbott could have done a little more than  simply say no to everything.

I have to say, I’ve dealt with Mr Oakeshott and Mr Windsor particularly. Also the Greens.  Obviously not as often as some others. But I found them to be very reasonable people to  deal with. I think Mr Windsor, you know, he calls it as he sees it.

BRANDIS: Penny, we have a Government and an Opposition - two sides - because the  Opposition’s role is not to agree with the Government.

WONG: It’s not always to say no.

BRANDIS: The Opposition’s role -

7



WONG: There are times an Opposition should actually sit down and negotiate.

BRANDIS: Let me finish please. It’s the role of an Opposition to put an alternative point of  view and to hold the Government to account. And when you have a Government that is as  notorious as this one for wasting tens of billions of dollars of public money, I think the public  should be very grateful that the Opposition doesn’t give a blank cheque to your  Government.

WONG: We’re not asking for a blank cheque.

BRANDIS: Yes you are.

WONG: No I’m not.

BRANDIS: Yes you are.

WONG: Well I listened to you George after being admonished so maybe you could do the  same. I’m not asking for a blank cheque. But I think on something like the Queensland  floods, I would have thought you could have actually sat down and worked out how to do  this in a way that could help Queensland.

KING: Alright. I want to move on from here too because I want to address the issue with  you, Penny Wong, about Kevin Rudd. Because he wants Labor’s post election review to be  made public. And I’m wondering if you think he deserves that given he was dumped  internally over his performance.

WONG: (laughs) I’m sorry, we were still arguing so I didn’t hear the first part of your  question, Madonna. But I think I get it.

KING:  No, no, let me ask you so that you do get it. Penny, Kevin Rudd wants Labor’s post  election review to be made public. Doesn’t he deserve that given he was dumped internally  over his performance?

WONG: Look, I think the election review goes to a whole range of issues. My view about  this as a Cabinet Minister is, I have to honest, less focused on chewing over - as the Prime  Minister has said - what’s happened in the past and more focused on what we’ve got to do  now.

KING:  But of course you’re going to say that, aren’t you?

WONG: (laughs) Well it happens to be true. I mean, I think there are people in the party  who rightly have to deal with this. The national executive has been given the review.  There’s obviously a range of organisational issues that need to be resolved. I have to say  from my perspective -

KING:  Have you read it?

WONG: No, I’ve read the public document. From my perspective, I’ve been much more  focused on how we deal with the floods, also Cyclone Yasi which has also unfortunately

8



been something Queenslanders have lived through,  and working out how we assist people  there.

KING:  Alright. Kevin Rudd said that the Labor Party is at its best when the factions are at  their least. Do you agree with that statement of his?

WONG: I think the party is at its best when it looks to the future and to what they think is in  the best interests of the nation. I don’t think that’s an issue of personnel per se. I think it’s  an issue of your attitude. I can say as a member of the Cabinet, that’s what we look to. You  may not agree with the calls we make. You make not like some things that we’ve done. But  I think genuinely people try and work through what they think is in the best interests of  Australia, and when a policy issue comes across our desk, what we think is the right  decision.

KING: George Brandis?

BRANDIS: Well I think that we saw the factions under the Labor Party when we saw Mr Bill  Ludwig on the TV last week at the AWU conference beating up on Labor Cabinet Ministers  for not toeing the union line. But the fact with my friend Craig Emerson, who he called a  ‘dishonourable rat’. One thing that we should be aware of about this review of the Labor  Party’s performance is that one of the recommendations that has been made public is that  20 per cent of the votes in every Labor party preselection, as a guaranteed minimum, will  be wielded by trade union officials. Now anybody who has been through preselection on  either the Liberal party or the Labor party knows that if you start with 20 per cent of the  votes already in your pocket, you are highly likely to win. So what this review, far from being  a reform, means is that union thugs like Bill Ludwig will still have the final say into who goes  into Parliament.

KING:  Alright. Penny Wong, Penny Wong, a very quick right of reply before I touch on the  last topic.

WONG: Well I think calling people thugs all the time is a pretty ordinary way to approach  public debate. There’s obviously always different groupings inside parties. George in the  first part of our discussion talked about that inside the Liberal party. And I think the  important thing is -

BRANDIS: The Liberal Party is united behind the point of view I expressed.

WONG: The important point is, you have got to try and make the call that you think is right,  in the best interests of the country.

KING: OK. So let’s go on to the last topic. And just very briefly, Penny Wong, federal  Treasury documents show the Government’s plan to ban mortgage exit fees could push up  interest rates on home loans and hurt first home buyers. I thought it was meant to increase  competition and make home loans more affordable?

WONG: Madonna, I think let’s have a look at the real economy. Let’s have a look at what’s  happening since we made those announcements. And we have seen more competition  between different financial institutions and that’s a good thing for consumers.

What we have said is, look we don’t think exit fees are a sensible thing. You know, just  think about it, common sense:  if you’ve got a mortgage and it costs you thousands of  dollars to shift to a cheaper product, obviously that’s a disincentive.

Now what we’ve done is we’ve given the corporate regulator the power to crack down on  banks that try and recover their exit fee costs in other ways that are unfair so they don’t  have that capacity. And I think you’ve seen some of the benefits of the approach that the  Government’s taken from the competition we’ve seen. We think competition is the best way  to give consumers the best deal.

KING: And the final say this morning goes to George Brandis. What would the Opposition  do instead to reduce the pressure on rates?

BRANDIS: Well what we would do is we would cut wasteful government spending. I mean  the biggest reason for the upward pressure on interest rates in Australia today is the fact  that this government is continuing to borrow $100 million a day, competing with private  banks who are seeking to raise money on the capital markets, forcing interest rates up.

WONG: Well the Reserve Bank Governor doesn’t agree with you here.

BRANDIS: We know interest rates -

KING: Penny Wong, you’ve had your say.

BRANDIS: We know interest rates are going to go up several times in the latter part of this  year. And if the Government hadn’t got us more deeply into debt than any peace time  government in Australian history, the interest rates would not be going up the way they are.

KING: Alright. We need to leave it there. All serious topics this morning. Perhaps they can  be a bit lighter next week. Senator Penny Wong, thank you for filling in this morning.

WONG: It’s been good fun.

KING: (laughs) George Brandis, did you have good fun too?

BRANDIS: I always enjoy talking to you and talking to my friend Penny.

KING: (laughs) Thank you. That’s Senator George Brandis and Senator Penny Wong in  Inside Canberra this morning.
