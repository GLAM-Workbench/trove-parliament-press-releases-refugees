Manufacturing and Farming Party Senator for Victoria John Madigan has welcomed the release of

a research paper announcing the discovery of a novel Borrelia species in Australian ticks.

“I r



eceived news on Tuesday that Australian researchers have detected Borrelia bacteria in ticks

found on Australian echidnas.” Senator Madigan said. “An unbelievable 39% of the ticks tested

were found to be carriers.”

This



latest research suggests what many Australians have suspected and that is, that Australian

ticks may be responsible for making thousands of Australians sick with a Lyme-like illness.

Before



the dissolution of parliament, a Senate committee, initiated by Senator Madigan, inquiring

into the growing evidence of an emerging tick-borne disease received over 1200 submissions.

The great majority of evidence that the committee received was from sick Australians who are

desperate for answers.

The st



udy provides hope to the many Australians who are currently at home, fighting this

debilitating illness, with many denied access to treatment and ignored by Australian health

officials.

“These l



atest findings are of significant public health importance to humans, domestic animals and

wildlife and urgent research is required to ascertain the effects this Borrelia species might have

on human health.” Senator Madigan said.

“The dev



astation and desperation that Lyme-like disease sufferers face should be enough in itself

to prompt further research and eventually, recognition. Unfortunately, it hasn’t and these people

remain medical refugees in their own country.”

Senator



Madigan called on the Federal Minister for Health, Sussan Ley, to initiate further research

and adopt a national Lyme treatment program as a matter of urgency.

“Once



this disease is accepted, it can be diagnosed. Once it is diagnosed, it can be treated. It is

time to end the unnecessary suffering of Australians who are inflicted with a Lyme-like illness.”
