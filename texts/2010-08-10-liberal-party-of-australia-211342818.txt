10 August 2010



TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   INTERVIEW WITH RYAN, MONTY AND WIPPA,  NOVA FM, SYDNEY

Subjects: Election 2010.



PRESENTER:

Small false start in speaking to Tony Abbott, we now have him on the line. Are you there, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

I hope so.

PRESENTER:

Yes you are. Fantastic. Good news. How are you, Tony, are you good?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, I’m in the middle of a tough election campaign, but it’s nice to be on air with you guys.

PRESENTER:

Well, it’s good to have you. Now I thought we’d start with just a quick, fun hypothetical. Have you ever  done hypotheticals before, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, yes, I’ve done them. They’re not always fun.

PRESENTER:

I don’t know if this one’s that fun.

PRESENTER:

Well, the thing about hypotheticals is they’re hypotheticals because they’re hard. Both ways they’re hard  questions but you’ve got to give an answer. That’s the rule.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok.

PRESENTER:

Here is your hypothetical. Ok, so you are given the chance to stop the boats, which is one of your promises,  that’s one of your big points in the campaign.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yep.

PRESENTER:

You’re given the chance to stop the boats. It works. Someone’s got an amazing way to do it. Don’t ask me  how, but it just works and the problem is solved.

TONY ABBOTT:

Excellent.

PRESENTER:

But, but, for that to happen, for the boats to stop, you have to legalise gay marriage. Would you do that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don’t think that’s a realistic either or.

PRESENTER:

No it’s not, it’s a hypothetical. Hypothetical. You’ve got to choose. You’ve got to choose which one you  prefer.

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t actually have to put a value on these things. I mean, I’m very keen to stop the boats and like Julia,  I’m very happy with the existing definition of marriage.

PRESENTER:

Yeah, but it’s a hypothetical, Tony. Unfortunately.

TONY ABBOTT:

I know, I know. But, you know, can I be one of those naughty boys who doesn’t go out to play on these  subjects?

PRESENTER:

Yeah, fair enough. I don’t think we’re going to get an answer here.

PRESENTER:

I’m going to have to move to the who would you do one, and I don’t know if you…

PRESENTER:

Marry, kiss or kill, Tony. You ready?

PRESENTER:

Tony, speaking of same-sex marriage. I mean you are quite outspoken saying that you don’t support same-sex marriage, but you’ve recently said that if one of your daughters was to come out and say that she is gay  you would support her. Could you honestly look her in the face and, when you know that she is in love with  somebody and say that she is not entitled to the same rights that you are?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, she is entitled, or would be entitled under those circumstances and we’re talking hypothetically  obviously, she is entitled to just as much love, just as much respect, just as much honour, all that, all that and  I’d do my best to give it to her.

PRESENTER:

Which is from a father to a daughter. But why are we not able to, in this day and age, to recognise same-sex  marriage when the love is very real, it’s no different between you and your wife?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not saying that the love is of a different quality. I’m just saying it is just by definition a different type of  relationship, not saying that it’s a worse relationship, not saying it’s a better relationship, not saying that it’s  not a relationship that I respect and honour, but it’s just a different relationship.

PRESENTER:

Don’t we celebrate difference in our country? Isn’t that what we’re all about, embracing different things, and  so why would a love be discriminated against?

TONY ABBOTT:

It shouldn’t be discriminated against but you can avoid discrimination without having to put the same label  on things.

PRESENTER:

Well, I mean, you could lead by example.

TONY ABBOTT:

I could, but on this issue I’m very happy to stick with the traditional definition.

PRESENTER:

Is that because, Tony, you don’t think a majority of the nation would be supporting of it?

4

TONY ABBOTT:

No, it’s because that’s just the way I am.

PRESENTER:

So that’s your views.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s my view.

PRESENTER:

Do we know if, you know, has it been out there to see how many people in Australia would actually support  something like this? Because these are very old-school, outdated views in my opinion, which you and Julia  follow and have these views. Is it not worth hearing what the Australian public would want? Like, taking,  you know, it’s just been legalised in California, you know, Iceland has a gay female Prime Minister who’s  just been married. It’s not something that’s out of the norm.

TONY ABBOTT:

When this matter was raised in the Australian Parliament three or four years ago there was a unanimous  support, I think, except for the Greens, I think everyone else supported the current definition. So, look, there  may well be one day, who knows, a change in mood. But that’s the way the Parliament felt and I shared that  position and I’m in no hurry to change it.

PRESENTER:

Tony, two questions in one here for you mate, changing the topic. We spoke about this yesterday, that  apparently the Liberal Party have gossip on Julia Gillard and they are picking their time to release it, that  will probably sway votes more your way. One, do you know what that is, and secondly is there anything in  your closet from your colourful uni days you’d like to get out now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my colourful uni days were very, very colourful.

PRESENTER:

Give us one story.

PRESENTER:

Did you ever smoke any dope, Tony? Did you ever smoke any pot?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that’s an old story, that one. But as far as I’m concerned the only things that are really relevant  in this campaign are first of all the policies of the respective parties and second the competence of the  respective politicians and that’s what this election should be fought on.

PRESENTER:

5

So you haven’t got any hidden goss on Julia, you haven’t got any hidden…

PRESENTER:

Scandals?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not.

PRESENTER:

You need a little scandal to come out. It helped Ruddy.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, no, no no. I think that we should do it on policies and competence, that’s what it should be fought  on.

PRESENTER:

Alright, we’re about to take some calls from listeners on 132410 who’d love to speak to you. One quick  question I’d like to ask you, Tony, this is another hypothetical and you owe me an answer.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok.

PRESENTER:

If you were married to Julia Gillard what would your pet name be for her?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t think Julia would ever consent to such a marriage.

PRESENTER:

You owe me an answer, Tony. What would your pet name be?

PRESENTER:

What’s your pet name for your wife?

TONY ABBOTT:

I suspect that it would probably be La Gillardine.

PRESENTER:

Oh, the guillotine. That’s what we called her. It’s not exactly a pet name, but…

TONY ABBOTT:

6

Well, look, it’ll do.

PRESENTER:

It will do.

PRESENTER:

It’d be an aggressive relationship.

PRESENTER:

Now, Tony, we’ve got one of our listeners on the line, Tony, who wants to ask you something. Tony meet  Tony.

CALLER:

Hi Tony, how are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good, Tony.

CALLER:

I’d like to wish you good luck, first of all.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well thanks so much.

CALLER:

My question to you is that how come whenever there’s an election it always seems to be the build up with  the two parties spent most of their time slagging the opposition off all the time and when all we want to hear  is what that party is going to do for us to keep our seat for the next three years?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a fair question and as far as I’m concerned it is important for the parties to have serious policies, not  just a negative attack and I think I spent three-quarters of my campaign launch on Sunday talking about what  we would do from day one. We’d stop the boats, we’d stop the waste, we’d stop the big new taxes and we’d  pay back the debt and I think that’s what the public wants us to do. They want us to end the incompetence  that we’ve seen over the last three years.

PRESENTER:

Does that answer your question, Tony?

CALLER:

Oh, I’d thought you’d beat around the bush actually. You’d probably call, you’d probably call her Tabby.

TONY ABBOTT:

7



Tabby, you reckon?

PRESENTER:

Oh, Tabby, ok. There you go. Tony, speaking of the boat people or stopping the boats which has been a  main thing that you are discussing, does it, just to me, feel so aggressive saying stop the boats when on those  boats are people who are fleeing absolute awful circumstances and then wanting to come and make a better  life for themselves. I know this is a huge problem, but in saying that, is it our major problem, is this  something that should be, you know, the main focus of your campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s not necessarily the biggest problem that we face but it is an important problem and it’s only a problem  because the current Government changed the rules and started the boats up again. That’s the difficulty. We  didn’t have this problem. The Government changed the rules and we’ve got the problem again and that’s the  point I make, it’s the ineptitude of the Government, the incompetence of the Government that’s caused the  difficulty. But my argument is not with the boat people. I accept that they just want a better life and who  wouldn’t. My argument is with the Government which has put the people smugglers back into business.

PRESENTER:

I’m still confused as to what you or Julia will actually do with the boats. It’s stopping the boats, but what is  your actual, what are you saying that you’re actually going to do?

TONY ABBOTT:

You’ve got to do a number of things, but essentially you’ve got to deny the people smugglers a product to  sell and that means temporary protection visas for people who come by boats rather than just giving them  permanent residency if they’re found to be refugees and you’ve got to have offshore processing and we had  offshore processing in Nauru and that was part of denying the people smugglers a product to sell. Julia says  that she wants to do it in East Timor, well that might be fair enough except that we’ve put a whole lot of  money into building a processing centre in Nauru, why should we waste more money by building a new  centre in East Timor, particularly given that the East Timorese don’t want one. I mean, the East Timorese  Parliament has voted unanimously twice.

PRESENTER:

So you want to re-open Nauru.

TONY ABBOTT:

Dead right and Scott Morrison, the Shadow Minister for Immigration, is just back from Nauru. He spoke to  all the people in the Government and in the Opposition there. He looked at the facilities that Australia built.  You could re-open it within a matter of weeks and everyone in Nauru on both sides of the political fence is  ready, willing and able to get the thing open again quickly.

PRESENTER:

But why not make Nauru, like, put like a rollercoaster in there or something, because as you said it’s not  their problem, but if they’re going to be put there at least make it fun or something?

PRESENTER:

8

It’s like a jail where these people are housed.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s not. You see, it’s not actually. When they were there before they basically had the run of the island and,  sure they were expected to have I think lights out and be back in the centre by a certain time.

PRESENTER:

And that’s not a jail like system, being told when to turn your lights off and be back in your room?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I think the worst you could say about it is that it’s a bit like school, boarding school. It’s  certainly not like a jail.

PRESENTER:

Tony, we’ve got Rory who wants to ask a question. Go ahead please Rory.

CALLER:

Hey Tony, I was just wondering when the last time you got really drunk?

PRESENTER:

Tony, we did ask this to Julia.

PRESENTER:

It’s true. I guess it’s what the people want to know, when you and Julia last boozed up.

PRESENTER:

And Tony, you do owe us an answer.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, look, I guess I was probably so drunk that I can’t remember when.

PRESENTER:

You must know. Christmas Day, I’m sure, Tony.

PRESENTER:

It can be stoned. When was the last time, drunk or stoned?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, once in India a long, long time ago.

PRESENTER:

9

Alright, tell us about that.

PRESENTER:

Here we go. We’ve got plenty of time if you want to share Indian travel stories.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, no. What happens outside of the jurisdiction should stay outside the jurisdiction.

PRESENTER:

Fair enough.

PRESENTER:

Tony, thanks so much for coming on the show.

PRESENTER:

Yeah, thank you Mr Abbott. We appreciate your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks for having me.

PRESENTER:

And all the best for the campaign. It’s going to be an interesting time.

TONY ABBOTT:

And, look, all the best to your listeners as well.
