NOMINATION OF AUSTRALIAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
TO THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, MANILA

Â

The Treasurer, the Hon Peter Costello, MP, today announced the nomination 
of the Hon. Justice John Lockhart, AO, Judicial Specialist with  
the World Bank, to the position of Executive Director of the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) in Manila.

Â

Justice Lockhart will be representing a constituency 
of countries within the Bank, the members of which are: Australia; Cambodia; 
Hong Kong, China; Kiribati; the Federated States of Micronesia; Nauru; 
the Solomon Islands; and Tuvalu. Following the formal election of Executive 
Directors at the ADB Annual General Meeting in early May, he is expected 
to take up the position in July 1999 for a three year period.

Â

Australia has been a member of the ADB since it was 
established in 1966 to assist the economic and social development of 
countries of the Asia Pacific. Australia remains one of the most significant 
shareholders in the Bank and attaches considerable importance to its 
work within the region.

Â

Justice Lockhart’s main duties will be to examine 
and provide advice on the wide range of policy issues considered by 
the ADB Executive Board, including ADB loan and budgetary proposals.

Â

As Judicial Specialist with the World Bank since March 
1998, Justice Lockhart has been assisting developing countries in legal 
and judicial reform projects. His extensive experience in international 
and commercial law will be invaluable to the ADB Board, and to Australia 
and the other members of our constituency.

Â

Justice Lockhart is on long service leave from the 
Federal Court of Australia, on which he has served since 1978. In this 
position he has had 20 years’ involvement, at a senior level, in matters 
relating to international legal issues; anti-trust; consumer protection; 
intellectual property; labour; native title; bankruptcy; refugees and 
immigration; commerce and corporations and the Australian Constitution. 
Justice Lockhart will retire from the Federal Court and the Australian 
Competition Tribunal, of which he has been President since 1982, before 
taking up his appointment at the ADB.
