Additional funding for migrant settlement services

The Government has maintained current levels o f funding for migrant and refugee settlement services  and will provide an additional $20.7 million over four years, the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

"The additional $20.7 million fulfills the commitment the Coalition made during the election campaign  and is a further indication o f our commitment to multicultural Australia," M r Ruddock said.

The Government will maintain the current funding o f $24 million for Migrant Resource Centres,  Grant-in-Aid workers and the Migrant Access Projects Scheme. In addition, funds for refugee  resettlement programmes such as the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme and On Arrival  Accommodation will total $6.1 million in 1996-97.

"Rather than taking an ad hoc approach to allocating the additional $20.7 million, it is important to  take time to identify the best combination of services, and how they should be delivered. Consequently, the first $5 million o f the new settlement funding will be allocated from July 1997," Mr  Ruddock said.

"This will give the Government and community agencies time to make informed decisions and is in  line with the Coalition commitment to involve the community in major decisions relating to  immigration policies.

"Successful settlement is a key to the long-term participation o f migrants and refugees in the  economic and social life o f Australia. It is critical that funded services work to ensure new arrivals  have access to and knowledge o f services.

"Communities and community organisations play a vital role in providing early support to new arrivals  who need immediate information on domestic issues such as educating children, finding employment,  and availability o f health and other services".

The Government will look at enhancing the consultation process with communities to identify the  initial priority needs for new settlers. There would be a particular focus on the special needs o f  refugees and elderly migrants, as foreshadowed in policy commitments.

Refugee settlement needs will be specifically identified in restructured advisory arrangements.

"The Government attaches a great deal o f importance to accountability and funded organisations will  be expected to provide services in areas o f demonstrable need," M r Ruddock said.
