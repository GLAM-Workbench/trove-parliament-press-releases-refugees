FIGURES CONFIRM LIBERALS WOULD MAKE DRASTIC  CUTS IF ELECTED



The Liberals continue to hide their plans from Australians, refusing to come clean on  what services they would cut if elected.

Yesterday, the Government released an Economic Statement that details the economic  outlook facing Australia, the challenges ahead, and the path to budget surplus in   2016-17.

We’ve detailed the responsible savings we will make so we can invest in important  reforms such as DisabilityCare and the Better Schools Plan.

Australians rightly expect transparency and accountability from the Government and the  alternative Government, especially in an election year.

Instead, the Opposition continue to hide their plans and their cuts from the Australian  people.

The Government has released its numbers in its Economic Statement, and Australians  deserve to know the Opposition’s budget bottom line too.

A detailed new analysis (see attached) shows that the Opposition's unfunded spending  promises would blow out the budget over the forward estimates.

This means that the Opposition would have to make $70 billion in cuts to match our  path to budget surplus, which they have repeatedly insisted they would do if elected.

The only way Tony Abbott can make his budget numbers add up is to cut deeply into  key services such as health and education, transport and infrastructure investment.

It’s time for Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey to stop hiding their plans and come clean with  Australians about the drastic cuts they would make if elected.

OPPOSITION BUDGET



The  Opposition  refuses  to  tell  Australians  how  much  their  policies  will  cost  and   what they will cut to pay for them. This is despite having already admitted that they  have a $70 billion budget hole which would need to be filled through drastic cuts to  services like health and education.

The  table  below  outlines  why  the  Opposition  will  need  to  cut  $70  billion  in  vital   services to return the budget to surplus, as they have repeatedly committed to doing.

THE ECONOMIC STATEMENT

The Economic Statement demonstrates that the Government is on track to achieve a  modest  budget  surplus  within  the  forward  estimates,  while  at  the  same  time   ensuring the economy is supported in the short term.

The  Economic  Statement  demonstrates  the  Government’s  plan  for  medium  term   consolidation and a path back to budget surplus in 2016-17.

The  Economic  Statement  includes  $17.4  billion  of  responsible  saving  decisions,   which have made a significant contribution to offsetting the impact of revenue write-downs in 2015-16 and 2016-17.

REVERSE GOVERNMENT SAVINGS IN THE ECONOMIC STATEMENT

This document assumes that the Opposition does not support any of the responsible  savings decisions taken by the Government, as recorded in the Economic Statement.

In  previous  Budget  updates  and  following  individual  savings  announcements,  the   Opposition  have  been  quick  to  criticise  the  Government’s  responsible  savings   measures while rarely putting forward their own. This is despite calling for savings  to be made.

REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES

The  Opposition’s  stated  policy  is  to  see  at  least  12,000  APS  employees  leave  the   public sector through natural attrition.

Unlike the Government’s expectation of departments and agencies that they focus on  non-staffing  efficiencies,  the  Opposition  puts  jobs cuts first. This is clear from their  commentary about the public service.

SCRAP THE SCHOOLKIDS BONUS

The Opposition has committed to scrap the SchoolKids Bonus. The costing assumes  this will occur from 1 July 2014.

REDUCE THE HUMANITARIAN INTAKE

The  Opposition  has  committed  to  unwind  the  additional  places  provided  for  the   Australian humanitarian intake. This would see numbers of asylum seekers accepted  via the UNHCR reduce from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.

Opposition Budget 2013

PRIVATISATION OF MEDIBANK

The  Opposition  has  committed  to  the  sale  of  Medibank  Private,  a  Government   Business Enterprise.

The  costing  are  Opposition  figures  from  the  2010  election,  adjusted  to  reflect  the   post-election  costings  update  undertaken  by  the  Department  of  Finance  and  the   Treasury.

Note, the sale receipts do not directly impact the budget balance as it is an asset sale  (the Opposition have claimed that the privatisation could raise up to $4.5 billion).

CUTS TO THE AUTOMOTIVE TRANSFORMATION SCHEME

The  Opposition  has  committed  to  reduce  assistance  to  the  automotive  industry,  by   cutting  $500m  from  the  Automotive  Transformation  Scheme  by  2015,  with  no   commitment of any assistance after 2015.

REPEAL OF THE EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME

The  Opposition  has  committed  to  repeal  the  Government’s  Emission  Trading   Scheme and several related programs.

The costing for the repeal includes the forgone revenue (on the basis of international  linking  and  an  ETS),  offset  in  part  by  unwinding  the  industry  and  innovation   programs introduced as part of the Clean Energy Future package. For example, these  include the Clean Technology Investment and Innovation Programs and Coal Sector  Jobs program.

The  costing  further  assumes  that  the  Household  Assistance  Package  is  retained,  as   the Opposition have retracted their previous position to remove this assistance.

It  is  assumed  that  the  repeal  cannot  occur  before  1  July  2014.   Were  it  to  occur  in   2013-14, the forgone fixed price permit revenue from this year would also need to be  included.

The  costing  also  includes  the  public  debt  interest  (PDI)  impact  of  abolishing  the   Clean  Energy  Finance  Corporation  and  revenue  forgone  from  not  proceeding  with   commercial  investments  in  clean  energy.  Although  a  budget  costing  typically  does   not  include  second  round  effects  (such  as  the  PDI  impact),  it  is  included  for   completeness.

Opposition Budget 2013

REPEAL OF THE MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX AND COMPANY TAX INCREASE

The Opposition has committed to repeal the Government’s Minerals Resource Rent  Tax and most related programs.

The costing for the repeal includes the forgone revenue, offset by abolishing most of  the  related  programs  and  measures.  For  example,  this  includes  cutting  the  small   business  instant  tax  write  off,  scrapping  the  Low  Income  Superannuation   Contribution, as well as deferring the increase in the Superannuation Guarantee.

PAID PARENTAL LEAVE POLICY

The Opposition has committed to replace the Government’s PPL policy with a more  generous scheme funded through an increase in taxes on big business.

Through  a  1.5%  tax  increase  on  Australia’s  biggest  businesses,  the  Opposition  has   committed to a PPL scheme that will provide 26 weeks PPL paid at the greater of the  National  Minimum  Wage  or  the  mother’s  replacement  wage  (up  to  a  maximum   salary of $150,000 per annum).

DIRECT ACTION

The Opposition announced a ‘Direct Action Plan’ as their main suite of programs to  respond  to  climate  change.  The  package  of  measures  included  an  Emissions   Reduction  Fund  to  purchase  abatement,  a  pledge  to  install  solar  panels  on  one   million houses and funding for Clean Energy Employment Hubs.

The costing was released by the Opposition.

CARBON ADJUSTMENT TO MEET 5% BIPARTISAN 2020 TARGET

The  Opposition’s  Direct  Action  package  of  measures  was  determined  by  the   Treasury  to  be  insufficient  to  meet  the  5%  2020  target.   Assuming  the  policy  could   access least cost abatement through the Emission Reduction Fund, forgoing cheaper,  internationally  sourced  abatement  as  committed  to  by  the  Opposition,  would   roughly double the economic cost of achieving the 2020 target.

The  economic  cost  of  direct  action  would  be  larger  and  less  efficient  than  the   Government’s market-based Emission Trading Scheme.

Therefore  the  costings  for  achieving  the  5%  2020  target  would  need  to  be  adjusted   upwards significantly, or the 5% 2020 target would not be achieved.  The estimate is  a lower bound, as it is extremely unlikely that a grant tendering scheme would yield  lowest cost abatement.

The  costing  for  the  adjustment  is  net  of  the  proposed  Opposition  spend  on  Direct   Action.

Opposition Budget 2013

GREEN ARMY

The  Green  Army,  a  conservation  workforce,  was  a  2010  commitment  of  the   Opposition.  The Opposition weakened their commitment in July 2013, by reducing  the financial commitment from $400m over the forward estimates to $300m.

Beyond the forward estimates, the Green Army is meant to increase to 15,000 young  people,  which  would  significantly  increase  the  annual  costs  above  the  current   forward estimates.

INDEXATION OF MILITARY SUPERANNUATION

The Opposition has committed to increase the indexation of military superannuation  pensions  (for  the  DFRB  and  DFRDB  schemes  only)  to  essentially  the  age  pension   methodology from age 55. The Government has recently committed to increase the  indexation  for  members  of  these  schemes  by  the  Pensioner  and  Beneficiary  Living   Cost  Index  from  age  65.  The  Government’s  commitment  is  more  modest  than  the   Opposition’s commitment.

The  costing  of  the  Opposition  policy  is  net  of  the  costs  of  the  Government’s  policy   (as recorded in the Economic Statement).

The Opposition’s policy has a fiscal balance cost of $1.7 billion over four years and  will increase the unfunded liability by $6.2 billion.

INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

The  Opposition  has  committed  to  several  infrastructure  projects  across  Australia,   from  major  projects  such  as  the  East-West  Link  Melbourne  ($1.5  billion),  to  minor   projects and feasibility studies.

The total cost of these projects exceeds $18 billion. As some of these projects (marked  with an *) replicate in full or in part Government announcements, the net impact of  these commitments would be lower.

Large  infrastructure  often  has  profiles  that  go  beyond  the  forward  estimates,   therefore  for  the  costing  assumes  that  just  over  half  of  the  funding  would  be   required in the four years of the forward estimates. This is consistent with numerous  comments from the Opposition that they will fast-track projects.

The projects included in this costing include:

Ã¢Â’ Bridges to Recovery  Ã¢Â’ Local roads in Blackwood

Ã¢Â’ Outback Highway (Outback Way) Ã¢Â’ Main Rd upgrade

Ã¢Â’ 500 rest stops - built over 10 years Ã¢Â’ 2nd freeway interchange at Mt  Barker

Ã¢Â’ Inland rail - Bris to Melb* Ã¢Â’ Upgrade of Gorge Rd and Fosters  Rd

UNWIND THE FBT CHANGES

The Opposition has committed to unwind the Fringe Benefit Tax changes announced  to offset the termination of the carbon tax.

UNWIND THE SELF EDUCATION EXPENSES CAP

The Opposition has committed to unwind changes announced to the Self Education  Expenses Caps.

Opposition Budget 2013

The  costing  incorporates  the  Government’s  decision  to  delay  introduction  of  this   change  until  2016-17  to  continue  consultation  as  recorded  in  the  Economic   Statement.

COMPANY TAX CUT

The Opposition has committed to business not paying any additional tax.  With their  PPL levy at 1.5%, a 1.5% tax cut would be required to achieve this objective.

The costing is an estimate of a 1.5% company tax cut.

DAMS AND WATER MANAGEMENT POLICY

The Opposition’s ‘Dams and Water Management’ policy was reported in The Daily  Telegraph in February 2013.  The total cost of the projects under consideration by the  Opposition was approximately $30 billion.

The costing assumes that 20% of the projects in the policy paper are funded, and that  the  Commonwealth  would  contribute  one-third  of  the  funding  required  for  each   project.

This  assumption  is  consistent  with  the  partnership  approach  lauded  in  the  report,   usually through a joint venture between the Commonwealth Government, the State  Government and private irrigators.

REMOVE MEANS TEST ON THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REBATE

The  Opposition  has  committed  to  remove  the  means  test  on  the  Private  Health   Insurance Rebate, introduced by the Government.

The  costing  is  based  on  the  figures  included  in  the  Fairer  Private  Health  Insurance   Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2012 Explanatory Memorandum, with the  costings assumed constant from 2014-15.  Note, this is a conservative estimate.

2010 SAVINGS NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO OFFSET OPPOSITION POLICIES

To  fund  policies  announced  in  the  2010  election,  the  Opposition  put  forward  a   number  of  savings.  The  Opposition  have  regularly  referenced  this  saving  effort  in   their budget comments.

However,  many  of  these  savings  are  no  longer  available  to  fund  Opposition  plans   and therefore further savings would be needed to meet the cost of their policies.

These  savings  are  no  longer  available  for  various  reasons.  For  example,  the   Opposition  committed  to  match  a  number  of  Government  savings,  which  are  now   incorporated in the budget estimates. Also, many savings were only possible in the  years  prior  to  the  current  forward  estimates  period  (i.e.  in  the  years  2011-12  and   2012-13), and therefore are no longer available to offset Opposition policy.

The costing of this item includes the $10.6 billion of errors made by the Opposition  in the 2010 election, and uncovered by the Department of Finance and the Treasury  post-election.

Other  savings  no  longer  available  include  the  discontinuation  of  the  Renewable   Energy  Future  Fund,  the  reduction  in  the  Green  Car  Innovation  Fund,  the   discontinuation of GreenStart, the discontinuation of funding for the retraining and  redeployment of Telstra Staff, and the discontinuation of the Global Carbon Capture  and Storage Institute.

Savings  that  matched  saving  commitments  made by the Government in the 2010  election, and that are now already accounted for in the estimates (and not available  for savings), totalled over $2 billion.
