CARRIE BICKMORE:

Now, Tony, we’re trying to get our head around this. So, this policy would mean if you’re a computer  engineer, you’re under 30 and you can't find a job and the only job available is fruit picking, I mean, how  are you meant to keep up your IT skills if you're busy picking strawberries?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Carrie, if you're under 30 under our policy there would be a relocation allowance for you to go where  there are IT jobs and I think it’s important that the whole thing be seen as a package, not just take any  particular measure in isolation.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony, a hypothetical. You're based in Canberra, you lose your job and there's plenty of, say, cleaning jobs  around, do you take the cleaning job?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you know, some people say opposition leaders have got to clean up the mess that governments make.  So, I guess I'm already doing some of that.

CHARLIE PICKERING:

Now Tony, a lot’s been said about this policy today. Do you think unemployed young people are lazy?

TONY ABBOTT:

No I don’t but I think it's easy for people to slip into a culture of defeat, just to assume that things aren't  going to happen for them and this is why I think it's important to stay engaged with them, motivate them,  and give them some carrots and some sticks, frankly, to do what's in their long term best interests.

DAVE HUGHES:

Now Tony, you may find this hard to believe but I was unemployed for a number of years.

TONY ABBOTT:

I do find that very hard to believe. An unemployed lion tamer, perhaps?

DAVE HUGHES:

You know what, I had, it was an advantage, it made me very attractive to women, but seriously, it’s very  hard to live on…

TONY ABBOTT:

You auditioned for the Chippendales and weren't given the job, that’s what happened wasn’t it?

DAVE HUGHES:

Alright, yeah, good one, alright. But it’s, I mean, unemployed people now have to live on $34 a day. That’s  under the poverty line. I mean, you do realize that people don’t enjoy being unemployed, don’t you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right and that’s why we’ve got to do whatever we reasonably can to get them off the dole and into  work because it's no life for people in the long run.

CARRIE BICKMORE:

Tony, just moving on to the disability side of your policy. You say today that maybe 60 per cent of people  on the disability pension could be treatable. Does that mean that you think a lot of the people on the  disability pension, this 60 per cent, are rorting the system?

TONY ABBOTT:

No I don’t. I do think that sometimes the system has a tendency to park people on disability pension. Older  blokes with bad backs, for instance, people who are having depression or something like that, I think the  system can park them on the pension when it's better to stay engaged with them and hopefully encourage  more of them to get work in the long run.

CHARLIE PICKERING:

So Tony, presumably you're suggesting spending more money on treatment of mental health issues and back  injuries, things like that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right and one of the policies that we took to the election was an additional $1.5 billion on mental  health because mental health is the silent epidemic. It's too easy to neglect mental health problems because  often it's not visible to the naked eye but, by gee, it's a torture for people who are suffering it.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony, we’ve got big issues on the national agenda - the mining tax, the carbon tax and the asylum seekers.  Why have you plucked out tough love on the dole out of all the issues you could be addressing right now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think I have been addressing all of those other issues and I've had a lot to say on carbon tax, I've had  a lot to say about boat people but it ought to be possible, Steve, to walk and chew gum at the same time and  an intelligent opposition is not just a one issue opposition.

CHARLIE PICKERING:

Tony, is walking and chewing gum a skilled profession or an unskilled profession?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s one thing I can do, mate.

CHARLIE PICKERING:

Thank you very much for joining us tonight, Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

I can even ride a bike and chew gum simultaneously.
