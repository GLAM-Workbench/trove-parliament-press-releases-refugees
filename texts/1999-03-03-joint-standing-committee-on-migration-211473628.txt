JOINT STANDING

COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION

Â

Refugee Council, ICJ to give

evidence on refugee review fee

Â

The Joint Standing Committee on Migration will hold a public hearing 
for its inquiry into Migration Regulation 4.31B on   Wednesday 3 March at Parliament House in Sydney.

Â

Regulation 4.31 B imposes a $1,000 fee on unsuccessful 
applicants to the Refugee Review Tribunal.

Â

“There has undoubtedly been some abuse of the refugee 
review process,” the Committee Chair, Mrs Chris Gallus MP said.

Â

“The Committee aims to find out whether the $1,000 
fee has reduced that abuse while not deterring genuine refugees.”

Â

“A number of organisations have expressed concern. 
We have already heard from them in Melbourne and we will be hearing 
from more in Sydney.

Â

On Wednesday, the Committee will hear evidence from 
the

Refugee Council of Australia, the Refugee Advice and 
Casework

Service and the International Commission of Jurists.

Â

The public hearing will commence at   10.45 am  in the   Jubilee Room.

Â

Gallus, on
