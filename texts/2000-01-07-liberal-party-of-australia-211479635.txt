Ruddock leaves on OverseasÂ   
Anti-People Smuggling Mission

Â

The Ministe  r for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, leaves on a five nation tour next week to discuss cooperative 
measures to address the global problem of people smuggling.

Â

Mr Ruddock will meet high level Government Ministers 
and officials in Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan to learn more 
about the experiences these countries have had in dealing with people 
smugglers and to provide information on Australia's tough new stance 
to curb the flow of people arriving illegally.

Â

"While Australia has taken a hard line to stop 
people smugglers a global approach is needed to stop the growing people 
smuggling industry - which affects many countries," the Minister 
said.

Â

"This visit is an important first step for Australia 
in this global approach. I believe that by sharing intelligence information 
on people trafficking we will be able to start building relationships 
that will enable an international response to be developed for dealing 
with this world-wide problem."

Â

The Minister said he would also be asking people 
to consider cooperation on identity fraud so that Government's could 
establish with some certainty the identity and origin of illegal arrivals.

Â

Mr Ruddock said that during his visit he would be 
explaining Australia's new legislation aimed at detering people from 
trying to enter illegally. He would be presenting a range of material 
outlining the new laws - including a poster, postcard and brochure - 
to the representatives of the countries he was visiting and asking them 
to consider the information's possible dissemination.

Â

The Minister said it was clear that a number of the 
countries he was visiting had suffered considerable economic and social 
consequences from people smugglers operating within their borders.

Mr Ruddock said many of these countries had been 
forced to provide direct and indirect financial and social support to 
thousands of people who had crossed illegally into other countries.

Â

He noted that in the 1999 calendar year more than 
1200 Iraqis and nearly 1100 Afghanis had arrived in Australia.

Â

The Minister said that during 
his visit he would be visiting many of the regions from which illegal 
immigrants began their journey to Australia.

Â

Mr Ruddock said he would also 
be meeting representatives from a range of key internatio  nal organisations including the United Nations High 
Commission for

Â

Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration 
and the International Federation of the Red Cross.

Â

During Mr Ruddock's overseas trip the Minister for 
Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Joe Hockey, will act as Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
