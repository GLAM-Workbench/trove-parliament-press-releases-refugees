TRANSCRIPT  THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP  SHADOW TREASURER

INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY  RADIO NATIONAL   RN BREAKFAST  THURSDAY 31 JANUARY 2013



E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

FRAN KELLY:

Joe Hockey, welcome back to RN Breakfast.

JOE HOCKEY:

Happy New Year, Fran.

FRAN KELLY:

Happy New Year to you too and it’s an election year - we all know that. Now we know the  date. Is this a gift? Should you be thanking the Prime Minister for this?

JOE HOCKEY:

I’ve seen much of the criticism this morning of the Prime Minister has come from within the  Labor Party and the fact that she consulted the Greens and Independents before consulting…

[Phone line drops out]



FRAN KELLY:

Are you still with us now?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yeah, I am. Are you there Fran?

FRAN KELLY:

Yes.

JOE HOCKEY:

Sorry, I’m just saying that I think the fact that she consulted the Greens and Independents  without consulting most of her colleagues says everything about the way she operates.

FRAN KELLY:

What do you think about this though? Are you thanking the Prime Minister? Because  yesterday I noted that you described it as trickery. I’m just wondering why it’s trickery for a  Prime Minister to reveal the election date early.

JOE HOCKEY:

I think it is trickery because it’s more about consolidating her leadership within the Labor  Party. I just don’t get the argument that they’re putting up that they don’t want a campaign,  that they’re (not) starting a campaign eight months early. It just turns her from being the  Prime Minister into being the leader of the Labor Party campaigning for re-election eight  months out. Frankly, it colours everything that the Government says and does now.  Everything is clearly within an election context.

FRAN KELLY:

And the same goes for you too, I suppose. Your boss is already out there with his mini  election campaign so the year was already set for electioneering.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well Oppositions do that Fran. Oppositions campaign from day one after the last election and  effectively that is what our job is - to hold the Government to account and to offer an  alternative.

FRAN KELLY:

Now Julia Gillard says the point of this is she’s going to spend the year governing, but people  know it’s an election year. She wants you to be held to account. We’ve got the election date  now. In theory, this gives all of us more time to judge the policies of both sides, which is  basically what you were just saying. If it doesn’t do that, what’s the use of any early  warning? So to judge what kind of government the Coalition would be, voters will need to  see your policies and to know how you’ll do what you say you will - which is deliver a  budget surplus every year. It’s fair enough, is it not?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yeah. Look, we’ve already released a vast number of policies including policies to repeal the  carbon tax and the mining tax. Just before Christmas, Tony Abbott announced $30 million to  juvenile diabetes research. We’ve announced that we’re going to not make any cuts to health  and medical research. We’ve announced infrastructure projects in Brisbane, Sydney and  Melbourne. We’ve announced the duplication of the Pacific Highway. We’ve announced our  policy on border protection and how to stop the boats. We’ve announced more than 40

policies already. Julia Gillard has done us a favour, because now people are going to focus on  the policies we’ve announced - give us a bit more air time - and gives us the opportunity to  get our message out there, whereas previously it was seen as being an election later in the  year and we’ll wait until then.

FRAN KELLY:

So it sounds like you’ve got no problem with getting all your policies out there including  major cornerstone policies I suppose - like matching the size and vision of cost of the PM’s  National Disability Insurance Scheme or Gonski scheme. You’ve got no problem then with  putting those out and details and costings in good time?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well Fran, we’ve always said we will and we have. I mean, we’ve been doing that.

FRAN KELLY:

No, you haven’t. In the last election we got the policy costings in the last few days of the  election.

JOE HOCKEY:

Hang on, hang on. The final policy costings will still be during the course of the election.  Why?  Because the Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook which is released ten days into the campaign  by the Government are the final numbers. So you’re not going to have different sets of  numbers presented to the electorate over the course of a number of months. I make this point  - we’re not going to cop a sanctimonious lecture from Labor about numbers. They have got  every single number wrong over the last five years and they’ve got it gigantically wrong for  promising a surplus for the last three years and now conceding just months after the official  figures are released that they can’t deliver a much promised surplus.

Now Labor says they can’t tell us how big the NDIS is. They can’t tell us how big Gonski is.  They can’t tell us what the funding is. They can’t tell us where the money is coming from and  they’re not going to tell us until May. So please, we are not going to cop this sort of lecture  for political purposes from Julia Gillard when in fact the government with all the resources of  the Treasury and the Department of Finance won’t tell the Australian people what the state of  the Budget is.

FRAN KELLY:

As the Treasurer said last night, the Government will of course tell how they’re going to fund  the NDIS and Gonski - two of their major election cornerstones.

JOE HOCKEY:

When? In May?

FRAN KELLY:

In May when the Budget is handed down.

JOE HOCKEY:

Exactly and we’ll start releasing the funding of our policies after the Government’s Budget in  May.

FRAN KELLY:

So from May - you agree with Wayne Swan - there will be no excuse then for the Coalition  to not release fully costed Budget policies after the Budget in May?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes, of course we’ll be doing that and Fran we’ve already been doing it. For example, we  said we would not be increasing the refugee intake to 20,000 which would save the Budget  $1.3 billion. So we’ve been doing it, Fran, we’ve been doing it. The problem is people  haven’t been listening. The government just runs the same old tired rhetoric about numbers.  We will not cop a lecture from a government that has never delivered a surplus and never  lived within its means.

FRAN KELLY:

Let’s go to one policy that I think has galvanised or interested a lot of people - a lot of the  nation and that is this promise of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It’s a major  change in Australia and both sides of politics have said it’s an idea whose time has come and  you’re both committed to it. If the money is there in the May Budget, if the government does  provide or outline the mechanism for funding the NDIS fully, will you at least then commit to  rolling out the National Disability Insurance Scheme?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we’ve already said we would. We’ve already offered to be part of a bipartisan  committee to work with the government. Tony Abbott’s offered to work with the government  to implement it, particularly as it involves a large number of Liberal states. We’ve offered to  work with the government on this. They’ve told us to go and get lost.

FRAN KELLY:

Yes, with respect though, I know you’ve offered to back the scheme, but in government are  you committing to funding the scheme if the funding is there in the Budget? In the Budget -  as outlined by Wayne Swan.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we’re prepared to be part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We support the  scheme. We want to see it rolled out, but you tell me Fran, how big is the scheme? Where is  the money going? Where is the money coming from?

FRAN KELLY:

At the moment we have the trials as you talked about - some of those are in Liberal states as  you just said and what the government is telling us and what the Prime Minister reiterated  yesterday is we will get that in the May Budget. We will get the funding.

JOE HOCKEY:

I look forward to that information. I mean for example, the government said that it was  committed to fast-tracking the National Disability Insurance Scheme, fast-tracking the  Productivity Commission recommendation which was about $3.9 billion over three years.  The government committed only $1 billion. They said they were fast-tracking it and they  underfund it. The interesting thing out of yesterday’s speech from the Prime Minister - she  guaranteed her political future by saying the election will be in September, but she also said  Australians aren’t paying enough tax. I couldn’t believe it when I heard it.

FRAN KELLY:

When did she say Australians aren’t paying enough tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

About six or seven paragraphs on her speech were about how Australia is not paying enough  tax and this is a problem that the western world has to face.

FRAN KELLY:

Do you accept it’s a problem if we’ve lost…

JOE HOCKEY:

Let me just finish. She went on to say that the government is going to be making “structural  savings” in the Budget. Now, the last time the government talked about structural savings,  they said they were saving $16 billion and, of that, 80 per cent were tax increases. So now the  government - the Prime Minister is saying Australians aren’t paying enough tax. We’re going  to have further tax increases in the May Budget. Well Fran, you tell me what they are,  because if you’re going to try and find $15 billion a year to fund the Gonski Review and the  National Disability Insurance Scheme, this government is going to end up taxing middle  Australia. It’s going to increase the tax take and there are not going to be any apologies from  the Prime Minister.

FRAN KELLY:

We’re speaking to Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey here on RN Breakfast. You don’t know that  the government is going to put up tax. What the Prime Minister was saying was that  corporate tax receipts in the wake of the GST had collapsed and the extent of that collapse…

JOE HOCKEY:

Well they haven’t collapsed.

FRAN KELLY:

Well they have collapsed - billions of dollars…

JOE HOCKEY:

I’m sorry, they have not collapsed. In fact the government is collecting tens of billions of  dollars more revenue this year than last year. What the government does is it forecasts a  massive increase in revenue and then when that massive increase in revenue is not delivered,  they suddenly say there has been a collapse. In fact, they’re collecting far more money today  than they did last year and the year before and what’s more, they are borrowing as well. So as  a percentage of GDP, the total hit on taxpayers - when you combine the debt they’re  borrowing with the revenue - is around 26 per cent which is, on average, far higher than any  previous government.

FRAN KELLY:

Yeah. We won’t go round and round this, but isn’t it true to say that the percentage of tax to  GDP is lower, (and) has collapsed?

JOE HOCKEY:

But the government is borrowing money as well. The previous Coalition government didn’t  borrow a dollar. This government is borrowing money which is future tax and when you add  that future tax to the current tax take and the government’s level of spending, they are, by far,  the biggest Government in Australian history.

FRAN KELLY:

Ok, before we go, let’s clear up the Coalition’s commitment to a Budget surplus, because  there’s been a lot said about this. Some of it on this programme over the last few days - is  there some confusion? You have…

JOE HOCKEY:

There is no confusion.

FRAN KELLY:

There is no confusion, so can you tell us now?

JOE HOCKEY:

We have said repeatedly and emphatically based on the published numbers from the  government, we’ll deliver a surplus in our first year and every year after that. It is Wayne  Swan who has walked away from his commitment to a surplus and we now again call on the

7



government to properly release the information about the state of the Budget. If the Budget is  in tatters, reveal it now, but do not go down the path of publishing numbers and then a few  weeks later walking away from them as this government is doing.

FRAN KELLY:

Well I guess we won’t know the real state of the Budget at least again probably until May,  but Joe Hockey thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you throughout this  election year.

JOE HOCKEY:

I look forward to it Fran on a regular basis.
