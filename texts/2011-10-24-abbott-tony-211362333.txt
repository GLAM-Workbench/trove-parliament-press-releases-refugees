TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here. I’m in the heart of Julia Gillard’s electorate of Lalor. I want to thank Nick Pitliangas  and his team for showing me around this important institution which keeps so many of the shops of Victoria  well supplied with fish. This is one of the tens of thousands of significant businesses right around Australia  which is going to be hit by the carbon tax. Pitliangas has got an annual electricity bill of about $100,000 a  year. Even on the Government’s own figures the carbon tax will hit them with a $10,000 a year increase and  that’s just for starters. Each year the carbon tax is going to go up and up and up. The Government likes to  say that it’s not going to hurt anyone but if it doesn’t hurt it won’t work. The whole point of a carbon tax is  to make electricity more expensive and the longer the carbon tax lasts the more expensive electricity will be.

I note today that the ACTU is proposing to establish a taskforce on job insecurity. Well, if the ACTU were  serious about trying to guard against job insecurity, the first thing they’d do is tell the Government to drop  this toxic tax; this tax which is going to hit every Australian’s cost of living and which is going to add to the  insecurity that so many millions of Australians now feel about their jobs.

Every day brings new and ominous headlines from Europe and other parts of the international economy.  This is absolutely the worst time to be introducing a carbon tax. It is never a good time to be introducing a  bad tax but this is the worst possible time and if the ACTU were serious, that’s the advice that they’d be  giving to the federal government right now.

I also notice today that the federal government is to spend $52 million promoting a website to identify waste  with charities. Well, this is a Government which is the gold medal winner for waste and now it’s spending  more money to identify waste in others. Well, really, this is a Government which should put its own house in  order before it starts worrying about other people.

Finally, let me just say that again the Government is blaming everyone but itself for its own mistakes. The  three boats that arrived over the weekend demonstrate that this is a Government which has totally lost  control of our borders and if you can’t control our borders you can’t govern the country.

QUESTION:

Are the Liberals considering running candidates in the Lyne and New England seats at the next election?

TONY ABBOTT:

There will be Coalition candidates in both seats. They’ll be good candidates and they will be candidates that  listen to their electorates.

QUESTION:

What’s your take on the poll on Oakeshott and Windsor?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think people should listen to their electorates and I think that’s the problem. I think that some of the  independent members of parliament haven’t been listening to their electorates and if you don’t listen to the  electorate you pay a price. Let’s face it, this is a government which lied to the electorate before the election  and it hasn’t been listening to the electorate since and if that’s the way you act, voters obviously will pass  judgment on you.

QUESTION:

Philip Ruddock said bringing back the Pacific policy won’t stop asylum seeker boats. Do you think the  Coalition needs to [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

The policy worked in the past, it can work in the future. It’s not going to be easy to stop the boats but it can  be done. All it needs is a government which has the intestinal fortitude to persist with offshore processing,  particularly at Nauru, to reintroduce temporary protection visas and to turn boats around where it is safe to  do so.

QUESTION:

So are you working on a new policy for asylum seekers or sticking with the existing one?

TONY ABBOTT:

We have been absolutely consistent for a decade. There are three elements to our policy: offshore processing  at Nauru, temporary protection visas and the option of turning boats around where it is safe to do so.

QUESTION:

So why wasn’t the Government’s offshore policy supported?

TONY ABBOTT:

The Government doesn’t have an offshore policy, the Government has an onshore policy. After the collapse  of the Malaysian people swap at the hands of the High Court, the Government could have adopted the  Coalition’s policy or the Greens’ and, yet again, it has chosen the Greens.

QUESTION:

On the NBN, under a Coalition government would parts still be built? We’ve got Malcolm Turnbull saying  it’s too expensive to stop building certain parts.

TONY ABBOTT:

The thing about the NBN is that it will cost at least $50 billion and it is going to be a massive white  elephant. Now, the essence of the Coalition’s policy is that we don’t support a government-owned  telecommunications infrastructure monopoly and we don’t think that all the Government’s eggs should be in  the one technological basket and the one thing above all else that we won’t do is throw good money after  bad.

Thanks so much.
