TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON JOHN HOWARD ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADF HEADQUARTERS AUSTRALIAN THEATRE

E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

Thank you very much General Mueller.  To Peter Reith the Defence Minister, Chief of  the Navy, Army, and Air Force, President of the Senate, my colleague Gary Nairn, other Members of Parliament, the Mayor of Queanbeyan, ladies and gentlemen.

Can I first of all say how pleased I am to have this opportunity of visiting the Australian Defence Headquarters here at Russell, to take the opportunity of, again as I frequently do, record my gratitude and I know I express the feelings of all of the Australian people, to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who in so many different ways have served this country magnificently and give great service and great distinction to Australia’s name around the world.

The purpose of my coming here today is to announce that the Government will construct a new joint operational headquarters for the Australian Defence Force, Headquarters Australian Theatre, at a site on the Kings Highway east of Queanbeyan in New South Wales.  I am informed by the Defence Minister, who’s comprehension of geography is impeccable, that it is 12 km east of Queanbeyan.  The Queanbeyan area was chosen for a permanent complex because of its proximity to Canberra, and the Kings Highway site between Queanbeyan and Bungendore has been selected on defence advice on security grounds.

In broad terms the new headquarters complex represents an investment of about $200 million in equipment and buildings.  The construction phase will inject an estimated $150 million into the Queanbeyan region creating up to 250 jobs in construction and related communications and information technology work.  About 1,000 service personnel are expected to work in the new Headquarters and if you factor in families there will be a requirement for local housing of in the order of 3,000 people.

The Kings Highway site offers greater flexibility to incorporate security safeguards in construction, the ability to control urban encroachment, and the fact that the site is not on a commercial flight path.  Queanbeyan was regarded as the most cost-effective option and also offered advantages in terms of back to back postings of senior military staff and their families, and minimising support costs.

A single joint command centre at the operational level will provide the Chief of the Defence Force with an effective and efficient means of commanding the ADF, ensuring more efficient allocation of resources and improve the information flow to the Government with more informed and responsive advice.  The new Headquarters will bring together for the first time joint maritime, land, air and special operations staff.  The Australian Theatre Joint Intelligence Centre and the first Joint Movement Group will also be housed in the building complex.  A permanent Joint Headquarters is the final stage in the development of a unified operational headquarters within the ADF three-tier command structure encompassing strategic, operational and tactical areas.

I’m very pleased to be able to make this announcment today, it does follow a very exhaustive process of assessment and discussion, not only within the Defence Department but also between the Department, the CDF and the elements of the ADF.  We think the choice balances the needs, certainly it was the site recommended to us and I know that bringing to a completion the process of establishing a location for the Joint Headquarters will bring a great deal of satisfaction to many people within the defence community.  And I want to thank all of those people involved in the Department and in the ADF who’ve committed time and effort and advice to enable the Government to make this decision.  And I thank my colleague the Defence Minister for his handling of the matter and the resolution of this issue.

Can I again say that it is a pleasure to be amongst you and to convey to all of you the respect of the Government and of the Australian people for the tremendous job that you are doing. The Defence Forces of Australia over the past few years have been required to undertake a variety of tasks, some of them in orthodox defence activities, some of them in less predictable circumstances. All of them have been conducted with a great professionalism and decency and humanity for which the ADF is regarded not only in Australia but around the world.  I know from comments made to me and my colleagues know from comments made to them that the esteem in which the ADF is held around the world, and in the councils of those who have an opportunity to compare and make judgements, has never been higher.  And that reflects enormous credit on the men and women who have gathered here today and I know I speak for everybody and indeed for all sides of political opinion in expressing those views to all of you and I thank you very warmly.

TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON JOHN HOWARD Q&A FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADF HEADQUARTERS AUSTRALIAN THEATRE

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE, CANBERRA

Subjects: defence; theatre headquarters; terrorist attacks; economy; illegal immigrants; CHOGM.

E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

JOURNALIST:

The US Administration apparently is briefing key allies on its case against Osama bin Laden. Have you received that briefing, do you anticipate receiving that briefing soon?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well at all stages since the 11th of September intelligence material has been available to me and to my senior colleagues in the normal course of events. Mr Downer had further extensive discussions in Washington a few days ago. I’ll be seeing the CDF when he returns to Australia. He’ll be returning late this evening, I’ll be seeing him tomorrow morning. But I’ve had the opportunity to look at quite a deal of material. In accordance with the normal prudence exercised in these matters I don’t go into the detail of it. But I certainly concur very strongly with the conclusions that have been reached and publicly enunciated by the President and by others in his Administration and by other leaders who’ve very strongly supported the American position.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard do you expect to make an announcment about deploying forces  before the election?

PRIME MINISTER

PRIME MINISTER:

I think what I can say in relation to that Michelle is that I’ll be talking to the Chief of the Defence Force when he returns and I don’t intend to say anything further than that. I will of course before any announcement were made if one is to be made, and I put it deliberately in those terms, I would of course in accordance with the undertaking I gave Parliament I will speak to the Opposition Leader before any statement is made.

JOURNALIST:

Do you endorse the message that Tony Blair gave to the Taliban overnight?

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes, I think he expressed views that have been put very powerfully and very strongly by the President in his address to Congress.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard last week there were something made of two people who were arrested in New Zealand over a plan to attack the Lucas Heights reactor.  Given the events late last week in New Zealand where those two were put into maximum security and they’re revisiting what was going on with that plan, are you able to elaborate at all?

PRIME MINISTER:

I don’t have anything to add at this stage to what’s in the public domain on that.

JOURNALIST:

Are you aware though that…..?

PRIME MINISTER:

I don’t have anything further to say.

JOURNALIST:

The original short list for the headquarters Australian theatre recommended among others the site, the Harman Naval Station near Queanbeyan, but not this highway site, on the grounds of cost, it’s cheaper to build it on an existing site. Why has that advice changed?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well one of the reasons was there’s no commercial flight path and the judgement was made and the preference was expressed.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] helping out Gary Nairn …..?

PRIME MINISTER:

No.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] the ADF to increase counter-terrorism activities. What prospect is there for increased resources being given to the ADF to carry out its work?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well if there is a need for increased resources that need will be met as always. I mean we have provided increased resources to the ADF via the White Paper and clearly over the medium to longer term if there is a need for further resources I can make it very clear if we are returned to government after the election that those additional resources will be made available. That’s self evident.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible]. Can you give a guarantee that if you are re-elected you’ll serve the three-year term?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look I’ve already answered that question.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] consider it probably about mid term.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well you’ve read my answer.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible]

PRIME MINISTER:

I’m suggesting that you read my answer. Read it very carefully.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister do you have a response to the latest interest rate cut - good news for the Government seeing as you’re about to go into a campaign?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well it’s very good news for homebuyers and small business. It means that our housing interest rates are the lowest since the 1960s. It’s also very good news for farmers and people in small business because nothing killed them off in greater numbers during the recession than very high interest rates. So of course I welcome it as being something that is very very good for people who are borrowing money. They are very low interest rates. I mean you’re about $350 a month better off now on an average mortgage than you were in March of 1996.

JOURNALIST:

But doesn’t it indicate that there’s a serious threat to the Australian economy that rates need to be this low?

PRIME MINISTER:

The Australian economy in common with all other economies around the world has had an additional cloud put over it internationally because of the negative impact on the United States and other major economies of the terrorist attacks on the 11th of September.  The good news though is that our economy is in better shape to withstand that additional pressure than most others because of what’s happened over the last few years.  The Governor of the Reserve Bank pointed out in his monetary policy statement this morning, announcing the interest rate change, that growth is still very strong in Australia and that was a very positive up beat statement. And it’s an accurate reflection of the fact that yes we are heading into more difficult times. There’s no doubt about that. Economically the next year is going to be a lot more challenging than the last two. But because of the underlying strength of the Australian economy we are better able to handle that. And of course at a time of greater economic uncertainty and challenge you need experience and strength and steadiness at the helm.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] extension of ASIO powers. Late last week there were reports of ASIO did raid some people’s homes, searching some people [inaudible] terrorist attacks.  Did you announce the extension of power because ASIO felt it needed or they haven’t been able to do things that they needed to do, or what’s the premise for the extension?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well the premise for the extension is that the Government concluded that that additional power, which is carefully and appropriately circumscribed, it’s for a period of 48 hours for questioning and only on a warrant that is issued by a Federal Magistrate. And that’s a very appropriate threshold of safeguard.  The view’s taken by the Government that in the general climate of needing to be more vigilant about terrorism or terrorist related activities you do need that additional power. It’s not specifically premised on any particular incident relayed or related to us or relayed to us by ASIO, but rather just a conclusion that in the different, more

5

difficult climate that additional flexibility is a reasonable ask of a Government that’s trying to do the right thing about security.

JOURNALIST:

Would ASIO be able to make arrests?

PRIME MINISTER:

No the arrests would normally be done by people who normally carry out arrests.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard can you give us an update on what is happening in Nauru?

PRIME MINISTER:

I was told that a further ten people have been taken off the vessel, off the Manoora, and that others are following. That’s the latest information I have and the Defence Minister nods his head so I must be right.

JOURNALIST:

Would you expect the disembarkation of all the remaining asylum seekers to be completed…?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well that’s the intention. But whether it’s going to occur today or tomorrow I can’t tell you that. But it is proceeding according to the original plan and we’re very pleased about that because it’s time for the people to get off. They’ll be well looked after on Nauru and properly cared for.

JOURNALIST:

Will CHOGM be held in Brisbane next year?

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes. The hope is that it will be held between the 2nd and the 5th of March. That’s a date that I agreed with the Secretary General of the Commonwealth when he saw me yesterday. I certainly hope that that date’s convenient to the British Prime Minister and others who weren’t able to come. We’re very keen and it’s an agreeable date to the Queensland Government and to others who have an interest in attending. I understand that it’s convenient to the head of the Commonwealth. So I certainly hope that we can get CHOGM on again. We didn’t want it postponed in the first place and we’re very keen because it’s an important part of our foreign affairs exposure and involvement to the rest of the world. Thankyou. [Ends]
