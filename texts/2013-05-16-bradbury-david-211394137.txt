SERVICES AND SUPPORT ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AS ABBOTT  CUTS TO THE BONE

Tony Abbott has placed billions of dollars of vital services and support on the  chopping block.

Mr Abbott has flagged that, unless he says otherwise, he will place vital services and  support on the chopping block.

By keeping, if needed, all Labor’s budget cuts - and - by not implementing any  of their budget spending measures unless specified

[BUDGET-IN-REPLY - 16 MAY 2013]

This includes funding for schools under the National Plan for School Improvement  and funding for cancer care.

Mr Abbott needs to come clean - as he cuts to the bone, will these programs be the  victims of Mr Abbott’s Commission of Cuts?
