Â

AUSTRALIA AND TURKEY COOPERATE AGAINST

PEOPLE SMUGGLING

Â

The Australian Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 
the Hon Philip Ruddock MP, said that today he had encountered a strong 
identity of views during his recent visit to Turkey on the need to combat 
people smuggling.

Â

During his visit, Mr Ruddock had met senior Turkish 
Ministers, including the Interior Minister, the Justice Minister,   
and the Minister of State responsible for Turks Abroad.

Â

Mr Ruddock said that Australia and Turkey already 
had extensive cooperation in a number of ways aimed at combating illegal 
people movements. These included exchange of operational intelligence 
and return to Turkey of nationals who have no legal basis for remaining 
in Australia.

Â

Mr Ruddock’s visit aimed to build on this cooperation 
and to discuss a range of further initiatives to counter the global 
problem of illegal movements of people. He had obtained a first-hand 
account of Turkish perspectives on the issue and had outlined Australian 
concerns about the growth in illegal arrivals over the past year.

Â

Mr Ruddock said that he had found the Turkish authorities 
fully committed to the importance of concerted international action 
to counter criminal activities.

Â

Me had outlined, both to the Government and to national 
and regional media, the new measures Australia had introduced to curb 
the flow of illegal arrivals. He had also given the Turkish authorities 
information on criminals involved in illegal trafficking. Agreements 
reached with Turkish Ministers included the following measures:

Â

Â· Â further exchange of intelligence on 
people smuggling and illegal movements; and

Â· Â continuing cooperation on return of illegal entrants;

Â· Â agreement by the Australian Government to fund a workshop 
for Turkish judges and prosecutors on the identification of people with 
refugee claims.

Â· Â agreement on a range of technical cooperation.

Â

Mr Ruddock said he had encountered during all his contacts a positive 
awareness of the strong links which decades of Turkish migration to 
Australia had forged.

Â

“We continue to welcome legitimate migrants and visitors from Turk ey 
as part of programs which serve both countries well,” he said. This 
contrasted with the strong concerns, in Australia and elsewhere, about 
the phenomenon of illegal movements of people.
