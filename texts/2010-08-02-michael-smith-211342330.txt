MICHAEL SMITH:

I’ve had plenty of calls on this Four Corners program last night on asylum seekers. Did you watch it?

TONY ABBOTT:

I did see most of it and I can understand why you’ve had a lot of calls because, really, the people smugglers are out of control; and the only way  to get that situation under control is to deny the people smugglers a product to sell, and that means bringing back Temporary Protection Visas,  and this is one thing that the Rudd-Gillard Government just won’t do. So, if we want to stop the people smugglers, I say we’ve got to change the  government because only a Coalition government will do what’s necessary to deny them the product.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Temporary Protection Visas by themselves, do you think that will do it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Not on their own. We’ve also got to have off-shore processing, preferably third country off-shore processing; and as I say, Julia Gillard, even in  the caretaker period, can pick up the phone to the President of Nauru today. I would certainly back her in doing that; and the first thing I will do if I  win the election on 21st August after being sworn in is to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru.

MICHAEL SMITH:

There’s another issue that I get plenty of calls on, but seems to have attracted very, very little debate in this national election campaign; and that  is our men who are fighting in Afghanistan. It was only last week that I took a number of calls from listeners who were very concerned about a  $7.5 million project that this Government won’t fund, soldier survivability, to give soldiers greater ability to survive an improvised explosive device.  You know the issue that I’m talking about?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not familiar with it in detail but I have at least some acquaintance with it and I just think it’s poor that the Government, which is spending,  rightly, a lot of money in Afghanistan, won’t go ahead with this trial because we’ve got to give our soldiers everything we reasonably can to protect  them in a very, very dangerous area.

MICHAEL SMITH:

$7.5 million seems such a small amount of money and it seems so poor form that Greg Combet would say to Defence, ‘well, you need to find that  from other revenue streams, we don’t have the money for you’, when they’ve got the money for advertising and what have you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there should be no question of that money being spent. It should simply be spent. Now, I am sure that in a $20 billion a year Defence

budget we would be able to find the money from somewhere to go ahead with this. But they should not be playing stick in the mud over this. They  should just do it.

MICHAEL SMITH:

If it was me, nothing’s too good for the soldiers. If there is something that provably is able to increase the survivability of soldiers in those  circumstances, you just do it wouldn’t you? Would you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m reluctant to use absolutely blanket language like this but plainly, if there is something that you can reasonably do that has a reasonable  change of helping, you must do it. You must do it; and look, to the Government’s credit, they have put, and the former Government’s credit, they  have equipped our forces with the Bushmaster vehicle which is apparently the most survivable of those military vehicles in the event of a roadside  bomb. So a lot has been done and that’s why it just seems so niggardly and so wrong and so counterproductive and wrong-headed of the  Government not to go ahead with this $7 million.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Would you say that they don’t support the troops wholly?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not going to say that they’re half-hearted in supporting our troops, that wouldn’t be fair. What I am going to say is that this is the sort of thing  that happens with arrogant governments. Common sense says something must be done. Some bureaucrat has said ‘no, we shouldn’t do it’ and  the Government believes the bureaucrat; doesn’t follow common sense.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Today Julia Gillard, in fact last night on the Seven Network, Julia Gillard said that she would like to debate you; and then she nominated the time,  this Sunday coming, which I understand clashes with your Party launch here in Brisbane. Is that true? The timing clashes with a pre-existing  appointment?

TONY ABBOTT:

It certainly is designed to take away all the oxygen from our campaign launch. If there is a debate on Sunday night, obviously, the following day’s  story won’t be about our launch and it was a very, very cynical ploy. Look Michael, Julia Gillard had the chance to agree to three debates. I gave  her a second chance to agree to more debates. She said no repeatedly; on at least seven occasions she said no. The fact of the matter is, based  on her commitment to one debate only, I’ve organised my campaign. It’s a carefully organised campaign. I don’t see why I should disorganise my  campaign because her campaign is in a mess.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Are you scared of a further debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course I’m not. I’m debating all the time. I’m debating with you; I’m debating with the press. I am in a constant debate. The last thing I am is  scared of a debate. I am not going to put my campaign at a disadvantage because Julia Gillard’s campaign has been taken over by the faceless  men and it’s a mess.

MICHAEL SMITH:

You also said to a reporter today, these are the words: ‘Are you suggesting to me that when it comes from Julia, no doesn’t mean no?’ Were you  joking around when you said that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Michael, look, the Labor Party spin merchants are running around saying, ‘this is terrible, this shows Abbott is insensitive to women.’ I’m not going  to cop this kind of vicious smear from the Labor Party. I’m the father of three daughters. No one respects women more than I do and this, frankly,  is typical of the kind of desperation that we will see more of from Labor in days ahead. We had Craig Emerson out there on the weekend  threatening a nasty personal campaign. This is the start; this suggestion that I am in some way insensitive to women. I announced today a  visionary, indeed a generational, reform in paid parental leave and they’re trying to run this kind of nonsense. I’m just not going to cop it from  them.

MICHAEL SMITH:

What did you mean then, when you say ‘When it comes to Julia, no doesn’t mean no’?

TONY ABBOTT:

I made the point that you just can’t be confident what she’s on about. First she said she didn’t want debates; now she said she does. First she  said she was one thing; now she says she was something different. The fact is, you just can’t take this Prime Minister seriously and I want the

real Julia to stand up.

MICHAEL SMITH:

It’s just after a quarter to four, if you’re happy to take calls, Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Mary from Chelmer. Tony, you’re speaking with Mary.

CALLER:

Hi Tony. I’d just like you to put more of an emphasis on what you’re going to do for mental health because you’ve been criticised for, that you’re  not going to implement the parental leave til 2012. Julia Gillard says she’s not going to implement her mental health plan until the second term.  John Mendoza just quit just earlier this year because they didn’t implement what they promised. So, she keeps putting it on the backburner.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Mary, thanks very much. On mental health, we’ve got a $1.5 billion plan which has been given a pretty substantial tick by John Mendoza  and Pat McGorry. On paid parental leave, look, the Government’s scheme starts on the 1 January next year. Our scheme will start on the 1 July  2012. So, it will start 18 months after the Government’s scheme has been in operation, and it will supersede the Government’s scheme.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Tony, may I pause you on that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Let me finish, Michael. I said when I launched the policy originally back in March that it would be implemented within two years of a Coalition  government taking office; and it will be implemented within two years of a Coalition government taking office.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Is it the case that the Government’s paid parental leave scheme that’s law, that’s going to happen next year, come what may.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, I mean the Government sat on its hands for most of the term. But it finally, belatedly, with our support, got a scheme in place to start  on 1 January. That scheme, it’s not a very good one, but it’s better than nothing. That’ll operate for the first 18 months and then our much better  scheme will take over.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Question from me based on questions from my listeners yesterday. Bob Brown, the Leader of the Greens, has made it very clear that he wants to  lock up about a third of our coastal waters and stop us from fishing in them. If you get the reins, if you head up the government, how are you  going to stop that from happening?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this whole marine protected area process, which has been quite rightly terrifying every recreational fisherman, or fisherperson, fisher I think  we’re supposed to say these days, I don’t want to be insensitive here.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Fisherman will do.

TONY ABBOTT:

Every recreational fisher, the diving industry, the charter industry, just about everyone who makes a living from or near the sea is rightly terrified  of this marine protected area process. We’re going to suspend the process because frankly it has been badly run under Peter Garret’s  stewardship. It does seem to be basically about locking up the oceans, and that’s wrong. Yes, we’ve got to protect the environment. But we can’t  destroy the livelihoods of the people who live off the ocean.

MICHAEL SMITH:

The local Greens candidate for the lower house in the seat of Moreton here says her policy is based on the animated movie Happy Feet.

TONY ABBOTT:



Well, that’s a very silly thing to say; and I think that it’s great to want to protect the environment, but your environmental protection has got to be  based on a) science, and b) respect for the human beings who need to live on this planet.

MICHAEL SMITH:

I’m speaking with Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition. It’s ten to four, and Kathleen [inaudible]. G’day.

CALLER:

Hi Tony. How’re you doing?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good, Kathleen.

CALLER:

Good. Tony, my question being, I have a child with a disability. He’s six, and he’s in a mainstream school. I noticed on the news a few nights ago  that if you are successful in coming into power your government will put on the table a $20,000 disability payment for students with a disability.

TONY ABBOTT:

You’ve got it pretty well right, Kathleen.

CALLER:

Yeah. I’m just wanting to know if, where, how, why, but, what is the criteria? Because the previous government, sorry, my apologies, the Kevin 07  Government, gave a $12,000 early intervention payment. We’ve used that up [inaudible] early intervention. The therapy for a child with a disability  doesn’t stop at six years old. [Inaudible] a lot of people say there’s nothing wrong with him. We do ADA therapy, which is $70,000 a year. $70,000  a year. We’re fortunate, my husband and I can afford it. But that $12,000 is now gone.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Kathleen, look, a) I want to say congratulations, all credit to you for the work you’ve done with your son. That’s really good; and the people,  the parents who work heroically with kids with disabilities are the absolute champions of modern Australia. I think that it was good of the  Government to put that $12,000 voucher down. Yes, it’s not enough, but nevertheless it is something, and it is a significant something. What I  promised, along with Christopher Pyne and Mitch Fifield my colleagues, was an education card for children with disabilities, which would provide  up to $20,000 for services to those children in the school; and the money would follow the child, so if the child changed school the money would  go with the child. Now, at the moment it’s only going to be for the 6,000 most profoundly disabled children in the education system, because we  don’t have a bottomless pit of money at the moment, with the $20 billion surplus turning into a $57 billion deficit. But it’s a start. It’s a significant  start towards looking after the educational needs of children with disabilities.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Tony, the Prime Minister Julia Gillard gave you heaps, called you ‘phoney Tony’ after your appearance on the 7:30 Report. In the last couple of  days she’s turned around and said ‘no, no, no, now you’re going to see the real Julia Gillard.’ Can you tell us who the real Julia Gillard is?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ll leave people like yourself and your listeners to make their own judgement. But it seems to me that we’ve had at least three Prime  Ministers in the last six weeks. First we had Kevin Rudd, then we had Julia Gillard, and now we’ve got someone called the Real Julia. Well, if  Julia today is different from Julia the day before yesterday, what the hell is going on here? Who’s trying to fool whom? That’s the question I ask;  and I think the real problem, Michael, is that she said five weeks ago, six weeks ago, that the Government had lost its way; and it had. But, you  know, things have gone from bad to worse since Kevin Rudd was so brutally politically executed. What she did yesterday was admit that her  campaign had lost its way. Now, it’s in the end a problem with this whole Labor culture; and the only way to get our country heading in the right  direction, I say, is to change the government.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Brian of Maroochydore, g’day.

CALLER:

G’day. How are you Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good, Brian.

CALLER:

Tony, we hear so much of Labor’s great economic management ability. My question to you is why you don’t make more of the fact that the last  Labor government gave the Howard Government an $80 b for billion debt, which the Howard Government retired, thus giving this Government a  $20 million credit.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Brian, look, it was even worse than that. It was a $96 billion debt that the Howard-Costello Government inherited, and the interesting thing is  that having paid that off and given the current Rudd-Gillard Government a $20 billion surplus and a $60 billion net asset position, within two years  the Government, the Rudd-Gillard Government, has given us a $57 billion deficit and an $80 billion net debt position. So you’re absolutely right,  Brian, Labor governments can’t be trusted with public money; and this is one of the reasons why we just have to change the government,  because if we don’t change the government, we’re going to have more waste, more debt, and ultimately more taxes. We’ll have more pink batts  programmes, we’ll have more school hall rip-offs, because Labor unfortunately can’t be trusted. They always ruin the fiscal position of the  governments that they take charge of.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Why is Queensland so important in this election campaign, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s important because it’s a big state. I think there are 30 seats here in Queensland. It swung hard to Kevin Rudd in the ’07 election, I think in part  because Queenslanders thought that Mr Rudd was one of them. Now, he was a Queenslander by birth and by representation. But he has been  brutally politically executed, basically by the New South Wales Right wing machine. The point I’m trying to make, Michael, is that this very day  with the news that $300 million has been asset stripped from Medibank Private, not only do we have the New South Wales Labor political style go  national with the political assassination of an elected Prime Minister, we’ve got the New South Wales Labor economic style go national, with the  gouging of money out of a government enterprise. I mean, one of the reasons why electricity prices, gas prices and water prices have gone up so  much over the last few years is because state Labor Governments have been asset stripping them. They’ve been extracting artificially high  dividends to try to rescue their budget position.

MICHAEL SMITH:

And it’s for that reason that this question of budget deficit and overall debt is so important to us at home. Why we pay more for things at home.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right. I mean, in the end all of the money that government spends comes from you the taxpayer, either in higher taxes or higher  interest rates, because the government is out there borrowing more, and it has to repay it eventually. So there’s no such thing as a free gift from  government. Government can only give what it gets from you. So what government gives you effectively its taken off you first, or it’s going to take  off you later; and that’s why government has got to live within its means. Now, you and I know as ordinary people that you’ve got to live within  your means. Labor thinks that government somehow doesn’t have to live within its means, and that’s why Labor gets governments into trouble.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Tony Abbott, thank you very much for coming in to the studio. It’s good of you to give us so much time. Good luck in the campaign.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, thanks Michael. It’s nice to be with you, and, look, I’ve been in Brisbane today, and least I could do was drop by.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Good on you. Good to see you.
