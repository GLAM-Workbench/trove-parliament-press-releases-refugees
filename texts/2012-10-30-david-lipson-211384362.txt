E&OE….

Topics: Climate Change, Hurricane Sandy, Asylum Seekers, Murray Darling Basin Plan,  Opinion Polls

DAVID LIPSON:   Well joining me on the lawns out the back of Parliament House is the Shadow Environment  Minister, Greg Hunt. Thanks so much for your time this morning.

GREG HUNT:   It’s a pleasure.

DAVID LIPSON:   While we’re just talking about Hurricane Sandy I just wanted to ask you, do you believe that  human induced climate change has anything to do with this storm that’s been described as a  once in a lifetime event?

GREG HUNT:   Well, individual storms of course I wouldn’t judge on. I have said for twenty years and more  that I believe in a human impact through increased CO2 and equivalent emissions - that’s not

in any doubt in terms of my own judgement.

I do remember living in the United States for two years, 20 years ago and there were three  storms of the century in the two years that I was there. So, that term gets used a lot. It’s a big  event. I’ve just had a text from a friend of mine whose in New York and said that his family’s  bunkered down and they’d had part of the building already ripped off and so I think we’ve  got to be very careful about politicising this and just focus on making sure that people are  safe.

DAVID LIPSON:   Okay, so let’s get to the politics domestically here. Reports this morning that Chris Bowen,  the Immigration Minister will today seek to essentially excise the Australian continent, the  mainland, from the migration zone to ensure that asylum seekers that do reach the mainland  can still be sent off-shore for processing. Is that something that the Coalition would support?  John Howard tried and failed to get this through.

GREG HUNT:   Well obviously there in a deeply desperate situation. Sixteen boats in a week, the highest  number of boats in any month in recorded history, 13,500 people for the year, the highest  number of people brought by people smugglers at any time since records have been kept.

So we will look at any details but at this point, there’s no plan that we’ve been given, there’s  been no attempt to engage the Opposition and there’s been no engagement in the process.

So if they’re serious, firstly they’ve got to show resolve, secondly they’ve should deal with  the Opposition but there’s nothing for us to respond to.

DAVID LIPSON:   On the reports this morning though, is that something, if they’re correct, is that something  that the Coalition would go for?

GREG HUNT:   Well we’d judge it if we see anything. At the moment it’s simply a newspaper report without  a plan. And what we’ve had repeatedly from this Government is over-promise and under-delivery and that’s the pattern right across the Government - over-promise and under-delivery and we’ve just had the highest number of boats in any month, the highest number of  people brought by people smugglers in any year and the year is still running with two months  to go. And so there’s a deeply desperate situation remembering always that it is human lives  that matter and we’ve had such terrible drowning’s and we’ve had such terrible levels of loss  of life at sea that it’s about resolve and we will support positive actions. We’ll judge anything  on the details when we see it.

DAVID LIPSON:   Also reports this morning on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan that several senior Liberals in  South Australia, Christopher Pyne and Jamie Briggs included, would potentially cross the  floor, if the Government, if the Opposition I should say, opposes the Government’s plan.  We’ve got a few more details out there now, still not a full plan. What is the Opposition  going to do?

GREG HUNT:

Well we’ll support a good plan which respects the rights of upstream and downstream users  and we won’t support a bad plan. As you say, we haven’t got the details but the history of this  has been five years of over-promise and under-delivery.

A classic example which is easy to understand: Six years ago the ALP said that they would  fix up the Menindee Lakes. They’ve been in Government for five years. They’ve announced  it on three occasions. That could save literally a hundred billion litres of water each year to  evaporation. The lakes are full at the moment, we’re going into summer, engineering works  could have made a huge difference and provided water downstream which would otherwise  simply evaporate if the dams had been dug out, deepened and the evaporation reduced. And  so we’re about practical things to reduce the loss of water.

The Government has talked for five years and delivered nothing.

DAVID LIPSON:   Well Tony Abbott does have a juggling act here in the Party room doesn’t he because he’s  got some Nationals in Victoria and New South Wales who are threatening to cross the floor if  he accepts the Government’s plan and others in South Australia are saying they’ll cross the  floor if he opposes it. So where’s he left?

GREG HUNT:   Look our goal is always to get a fair balance for both upstream and downstream users. We  can get a good environmental outcome and a good outcome for people. But the focus has to  be on engineering works and practical environmental works. The Menindee Lakes is just an  example of a pattern across the whole of the Government where they will make a big  announcement but then never deliver.

How can it be that after five years not a spade, not a shovel, not a back hoe has been moved,  for what could deliver 100 billion litres of real savings which would be of enormous benefit  downstream as well as a great benefit for the environment whilst not reducing the available  pool of water. So that’s a real example of the sort of thing that we’ll do to help the river and  to help communities.

DAVID LIPSON:   The Government has announced a more tangible plan to save water through irrigation  upgrades and the like. Four hundred and fifty gigalitres would be flushed down the Murray.  South Australia’s very happy about it. We’ve got a few details on that late last week, now  that you’ve had the weekend to pour over it where does the Coalition stand on that element of  the plan?

GREG HUNT:   We did get some details, you’re absolutely right. We now know that only 3% of the money  that was announced is actually funded in the budget. So, there is 56 million out of 1.77 billion  that’s been funded. That’s it.

So the Government has made a promise out to 2024, which it doesn’t have to deliver, which  somebody else is going to have to pay for. There’s 3% so less than one thirtieth of the amount  that’s needed that’s been provided and I think that’s just the pattern that we’re facing - grand  announcement, but under delivery. And whether it’s the Asian white paper or whether it’s the  surplus that is clearly disappearing, whether it’s border protection, whether it’s the fact that

they’d never have a Carbon Tax. It’s this grand announcement followed by under-delivery  that’s unfortunately the hallmark.

DAVID LIPSON:   And just finally before I let you go, the polls are back to fifty-fifty. Yesterday Tony Abbott  was back at a factory that he’s been to before, spruiking his anti-carbon tax campaign. Is he,  as has been suggested by the Government, running out of puff?

GREG HUNT:   No. And I say that because electricity prices, gas prices, refrigeration costs, fertiliser costs -  these are the things that are affecting farmers, small businesses and in particular families.
