LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP QUEENSLAND ALP CONFERENCE GOLD COAST INTERNATIONAL

MAY 31 2002

The result of the last federal election was disappointing.

We didn’t lose that election in Queensland.

We lost it elsewhere, right across the country.

But if we are to win the next election - and I am determined that we will - we need to win this state.

Before we can do that we need to face home truths.

Our performance in Queensland has to improve.  We must do better and hold better than only a quarter of the seats here.

But in saying that let me say also that the MPs who come from Queensland are playing a central role in the shadow ministry and caucus.  They are pivotal in taking the fight up to this Government.

The quality and calibre of the members of the front and back bench you have given us is tremendous and they form part of a great team.

We just need more of them.

So too there is great opportunity in partnership with the Beattie Government to deal with the many areas of overlap.

A new partnership for a real change.

John Howard sees the Labor states as a threat. I see them as an opportunity. Let’s seize it together

Reversing the political norms

What a weird last couple of weeks it’s been for the Howard Government.

2

They’ve managed to reverse all the accepted norms of good public policy and sound politics.

Shared sacrifice  for  the  war  on  terrorism  now  means  the  sick  and the  poor pay more for their medicines and the disabled have their pension cut, but the wealthiest three per cent get a tax cut for their retirement.

A Treasurer who once warned that a deficit Budget would wreck the economy and  drive  up  interest  rates,  now  delivers  us  a  deficit  Budget  that  he  says saved the economy.

Nick Minchin now complains that the National Party are a bunch of dangerous Lefties  and  need  to  be  merged  with  the  Liberals  to  drag  them  back  to  the Right  because  they  won’t  support  the  further  sale  of  Telstra.   Well,  they needn’t have bothered because Ron Boswell let the cat out of the bag - the Nats have already rolled over.

And  John  Howard  tells  a  Chinese  Communist  Party  training  institute  our country  is  a  democracy  because  we  resisted  Liberal  Party  pressure  in  the 1950s to ban the Communist Party in Australia, while back home he argues for new laws to ban, not just one party, but any organisation he regards as a threat.

What’s  next?  Tony  Abbott  defending  the  rights  of  workers  who  have  been unfairly dismissed?

Labor has also managed to reverse some of the accepted norms of politics.

Normally an Opposition criticizes the Budget and gets little attention from the media.

A  Rehame  report  just  out  has  come  up  with  the  amazing  finding  that  our response to the Budget has received more coverage and comment than the Federal Budget.

It’s because we’ve been positive.

Unusually for an Opposition, our ideas are the news.

And these ideas are differentiating ourselves from the Liberals.

Our agenda has caught the public’s imagination and that’s how we want it to stay.

Modern Labor

It’s  particularly  good  to  be  here  with  Peter  Beattie  tonight  because  he’s demonstrated the benefits of modernizing and reforming the Labor Party.

Peter strengthened the Party and the electorate rewarded him.

3

That’s why we need to improve the Labor Party - not for internal reasons, but because it’s the key to victory.

The Australian people look to Labor as the Party of hope.

We can’t deliver on that hope until we modernize and strengthen ourselves.

But let me address the unions issue first.

I don’t know anyone who argues that the union movement cost us the last election.

On the contrary, we wouldn’t have got as close as we did to winning without their efforts.

I can’t imagine a Labor Party that doesn’t have a strong relationship with the union movement.  We both stand for the interests of working people.

We stood together at the last election, in the most difficult of circumstances, to fight the Coalition’s anti-union agenda.

I  want  to  acknowledge  the  enormous  contribution  that  many  unions  and union members put in to that effort.

Regardless of any changes we make to our structures, Labor and the unions will continue to have a strong relationship and I believe that relationship can be improved even further.

Labor and the trade union movement share a common agenda to make life better for working families.

That’s  why  we’ve  put  forward  a  new  agenda  for  working  families  that includes:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Paid maternity leave;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A tax cut for working families so that together with the ACTU we can lift the living wage;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The protection of 100 percent of workers’ entitlements - for everyone, not just the people who work for Stan Howard;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A cut to superannuation contributions tax for every worker, not just the top 3 percent of wage earners Peter Costello wants to reward; and,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Opposing the Howard-Abbott unfair dismissals laws.  John Howard has threatened to make this a double dissolution issue - again.  Well if he

4

wants to fight an election over making it easier to sack people, bring it on, John.  Make my day!

Labor and the union movement will continue to have a strong relationship in the same way that we worked together to develop this policy agenda.

There’s no magic in the actual proportions of the level of union representation in the ALP.

It’s  the  quality  of  the  relationship  and  the  agenda  we  pursue  that  matters most.

And  I  think  we  should  use  this  reform  process  to  improve  that  relationship even further.

It can be made better.  Unions are one of our best assets, so let’s exploit our relationship to the full.

Let’s have new and better forms of consultation with the leadership and the rank and file.

Let’s get more rank-and-file union members joining the Party.

And let’s use the training and recruitment techniques mastered by the union movement to increase the size and activism of the Party’s membership.

But it’s not enough to just have a good relationship with the union movement.

We went to the last election and the one before with a good relationship, but we didn’t win.

No  matter  how  good  our  relationship  with  the  unions  is  and  how  good  our agenda is, we can’t implement it unless we win government.

The Government won’t implement Labor’s agenda. Only Labor can.  But to do it we have to lift our primary vote.

We won’t lift our primary vote unless we are more inclusive of other groups, other interests and other concerns.

We must get them to join us and vote for us.  They won’t do this until they get equal representation.  It’s as simple as that.

It has to be an equal partnership.

And that’s why I support the 50:50 proposition.

But the modernization doesn’t end there.

5

We  must  make  Party  membership  more  meaningful  by  democratising  our processes from top to bottom.

Every member who pays his or her membership fees must have an equal say.

We must make it easier to join and easier to participate.

And  we  must  build  further  integrity  into  the  membership  lists  if  we’re  to effectively counter the branch stackers.

Let me state one change I’d like to see: we must adopt the broad principle for our  party  preselection  that  if  you  can’t  vote  Labor  in  a  state  or  federal election, you shouldn’t be able to choose a Labor candidate.

We need to make arrangements for people who are not on the roll for valid reasons, like people under 18 years of age.

Peter  Beattie  and  I  used  the  integrity  and  standards  provided  by  the Australian  Electoral  Commission  to  verify  membership  to  create  a  better model of affiliation of unions in the Queensland Branch.

It’s a sensible solution that worked there and we should use it again.

Our opponents lecture us about our preselection processes.  But let me tell you how their Party operates.

The recent Liberal Party preselection in Ryan saw up to 500 members, most recruited in the last two or three years, vote to determine who would be the Liberal candidate.

Many  of  those  who  voted  aren’t  on  the  electoral  roll  -  well  not  on  the Australian Electoral Roll.

Under the bizarre constitution of the Queensland Liberal Party, branches can simply meet and vote by a two-thirds majority to declare someone eligible to vote in a preselection ballot.

In this way 50 people living outside of Ryan - on the Gold Coast, in Sydney, in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore - were able to vote in the Liberal Party preselection.

They weren’t bussed in.  They were flown in.

That’s an outrageous abuse of our democracy.

6

Now  I  know  why  Peter  was  so  successful  getting  Virgin  to  relocate  to Brisbane.   The  Liberal  Party  preselection  processes  have  created  a  bonanza for the airline industry.

We can’t reward the branch stackers and I challenge the Prime Minister to do the same in his party.

It is important that all political parties regain the trust of the Australian public.

It  is  not  enough  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  process  that  selects  our candidates,  we  must  make  the  Party  itself  more  attractive,  more  inclusive, easier to join and easier to participate in.

One of my objectives in pursuing the Hawke-Wran Review is to widen Party membership  and  the  decision-making  processes,  including  National Conference.

We need to significantly increase the size of National Conference to allow for the direct election of rank and file branch members to it.

I am delighted by the many submissions that have come forward and there are many constructive proposals about how this might be addressed.

We will continue to discuss these options.

As part of the process of getting our house in order we also have to ensure that disputes in the Party are resolved by the Party, not the courts.

I said from the beginning we need a more effective national appeals process. We will work this process through too.

What we propose

There’s one further element of modernization.

That’s adopting new policies.

I want us to be known for what we propose, not what we oppose.

I want people to vote FOR us because of our policies, not just AGAINST them because of theirs.

As you know, we’re conducting a policy review.

It will be thorough and every member will be able to put his or her views.

7

Whilst that Review is in process we have had to address a number of current issues as they arise.

One of these is the question of how to handle asylum seekers.

On day one I said that you can balance protecting our borders with a more compassionate approach to asylum seekers.

In Brisbane on Australia Day I called for the release of children and mothers from behind razor wire.

Following  the  first  shadow  cabinet  and  caucus  meetings  this  year  I  also released a detailed discussion paper and announced that a Labor Government would:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Mothball Woomera;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Return the management of centres to the Government;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introduce greater public scrutiny of centres; and,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Speed up the processing of asylum seekers.

I remain committed to mandatory detention because we must have a system whereby people who arrive without identity papers have their identity verified and have appropriate security and health checks.

I don’t know anyone who argues against this principle.

So let’s be honest with ourselves.

I  said  from  the  outset  that  we  must  review  the  length  of  time  it  takes  to process  asylum  seekers  and  improve  the  conditions  under  which  they  are held, and that’s what we are doing.

It’s not a matter of whether people should be detained, but for how long and under what conditions.

And there are a number of other things we’ve announced.

For a start, we’re going to fix Telstra without selling it.

Australians don’t want more privatisation; they want lower prices and better services.

That’s what Lindsay Tanner’s paper is all about.

8

The conservatives don’t want a solution to our telecommunications problems; they just want to sell Telstra.

Last year the Government made approximately $1.4 billion in dividends from the 50.1 percent public share of Telstra.

Its  dividend  is  higher  than  the  cost  of  the  debt  it  would  retire;  particularly after you pay the $654 million that the Government plans to give merchant bankers and management consultants to flog it off.

We want to spend that dividend on better schools and better hospitals, not an army of management consultants.

The Howard Government will try to tempt the other parties into the sale of Telstra with lavish spending promises to tackle salinity and other problems.

If these projects are so important, why not pay for them out of the dividends from Telstra every year, not just in once-off flog-off of assets?

Remember, once Telstra’s gone, it’s gone.

And  once  it’s  gone  the  Howard  Government  will  set  its  sights  on  the  next target - Australia Post.

We’re  going  to  amend  the  Howard  Government’s  anti-terrorism  bill  so  it targets terrorists and only terrorists.

And we’re going to introduce a plan to make our children safer.

We all know the circumstances surrounding Peter Hollingworth’s role in the child sex abuse scandal concerned a lot of people in Queensland.

Peter Beattie and I both said that something positive must come of the episode to ensure that our children are better protected in the future.

That’s why I’ve announced that I will create a new office that will be a national voice to protect children and young people and advise government on their needs.

And I will insist on checks on everyone who works with kids to ensure their good character.

Look also at our response to the Budget.

We  will  vote  against  Mr  Howard’s  30  percent  increase  in  the  cost  of medicines. We  will  vote  against  his  attempt  to  throw  people  with  disabilities  onto  the unemployment queues.

9

But we have proposals to rein in the cost to ensure the same Budget bottom line.

And we will vote against their super deal for the super rich.

Labor was the party that introduced superannuation for all in the workforce. It’s only ever been advanced under Labor and we are the only party that will introduce super for all - not just the few.

Costello’s Glass Jaw

Before I finish I want to make some observations about our opponents.

Modern Labor is about policies.  An agenda to give people hope.

The Coalition has no agenda.  They are a policy vacuum, and they’re filling that vacuum with the only thing they have left - leadership tensions.

Everyone expects Peter Costello to become the next Liberal leader about 400 days from now.

I wouldn’t be so sure.

He’s not a contender; he’s a pretender - with a glass jaw.

He thinks he’s tough in Question Time when people can’t answer back and when he picking on pensioners and people on disability pensions.

But as soon as he comes under any pressure he falls to bits.

He’s botched two election campaigns in a row.

He’s handed down the worst received Budget in a decade.

He gambled away nearly $5 billion of your money on currency swaps.

And now we learn that the Defence Department has lost more money on foreign currency deals than it has cost to fight the War on Terrorism.

What’s going on when our armed forces are playing the foreign currency market?  It’s bizarre.

And last week he was exposed again when he circulated to voters in his own electorate a pamphlet claiming to have produced a sixth Budget surplus when the Budget is actually in deficit.

10

He’s attacked us for misrepresenting his Budget, but he’s misrepresented it himself to his own voters.  Hopeless!

And then there’s the question of Peter Costello’s courage.

Last Thursday marked the eighth anniversary of him becoming Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party.

Is he ever going to make his move?

He stood aside for Downer.  And then he stood aside for Howard.

He’s the 90-pound weakling who’s always getting sand kicked in his face and getting pushed to the back of the food queue.

They call Costello “K-Mart Keating”, but could you imagine Paul Keating standing aside for a man who wears fishnet stockings?

The fact is, Peter Costello hasn’t got the courage to seize the moment and take the Leadership from Howard.

He’s the Hamlet from Higgins, always agonizing over his big chance.

“To be PM or not to be…”

Conclusion

Everything we have seen since the last election has confirmed this is a Government that has run out of ideas, led by a leader who is coasting toward retirement on his own Contiki Tour for over ‘60s.

They’re starting to fall out amongst each other as they jockey for the succession.

The main contender has been exposed as an incompetent pretender.

They’re recycling old and unpopular ideas like selling Telstra and getting rid of unfair dismissals laws.

They’re paralysed by indecision and can’t solve serious problems, like ensuring that Australia has a strong system of medical liability insurance.

It’s a vacuum.

The Australian people don’t want this.

11

They want a party that can give them hope.

A party that doesn’t pass the buck to the states and blame others for their lack of success but which will cooperate to solve problems and improve services.

We’re the only party who can provide that hope.

Lets modernize and strengthen ourselves so we’re ready to take on that responsibility.
