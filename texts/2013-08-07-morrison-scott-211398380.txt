GILBERT:

With me now from Canberra is the Shadow Immigration Minister Scott Morrison.  Mr Morrison, thanks for  your time.  Now apparently Tony Abbott wrote to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to seek  advice on whether the government had contravened the caretaker provisions by signing a Memorandum of  Understanding yesterday with PNG.  Prime Minister Rudd was asked about that this morning, he says that  they entirely respected the caretaker provisions and this was all to the letter of the law.  What’s your  response?



MORRISON:

Well whether it’s to the letter of the law we’ll find out ultimately, I think it’s very much against the spirit but  what it does show is the government was just rushing yet another  announcement, another decision through  the process and that’s what we’ve seen with this PNG arrangement the whole way, just ill-thought through.   The real issue is with the arrangement itself.  This arrangement does not back up Kevin Rudd’s claim that  anyone who gets sent to PNG won’t be back in Australia.  It’s just not true, it’s not backed up by this

arrangement, PNG has a right of veto over who is ultimately settled there and for those found not to be  refugees well they’ll end up being Australia’s problem because the agreement is completely silent on that  issue.  So once again, Kevin Rudd talks big and just doesn’t deliver when it comes to the text.



GILBERT:

Tony Abbott writing to the Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary asking whether or not this had contravened  the caretaker provision, that indicates that he’s not necessarily going to back the PNG deal after all.  You’ve  said previously that you would see how it works, if it works you’ll keep it.



MORRISON:

No that’s not what it means.  What it means is that yesterday we were trying to understand what the  government had actually agreed to and we were asking for copies of that arrangement and the government  refused to provide it to us.  Then we learnt something of the nature of the process, the very rushed process  the Prime Minister had entered into.  We simply wanted to see the arrangement.  We’ve seen the  arrangement now and it also includes additional financial burdens that weren’t there previously.  The  Australian government has now signed up to pay the cost for those who are coming across Papua New  Guinea’s borders as well under this arrangement.  So not enough that we have got to spend around $450  million in extra funds for roads and hospitals and universities and extra police in Papua New Guinea, now  we’re going to pay the cost of their illegal arrival problem as well.



GILBERT:

Now one of the concerns that you and other critics have raised is whether or not this has support across the  divide in PNG.  Peter O’Neill is a strong backer of it, he’s got a big majority in that parliament, if you  support it there’s no sign of that wavering in PNG, do you concede that?



MORRISON:

That’s not the point, Kieran, the point is the arrangement -

GILBERT:

Well it’s half the point, isn’t it?  You need them to back it.



MORRISON:

No - the arrangement that Kevin Rudd said he had was that anyone who goes to Papua New Guinea won’t  end up back in Australia.  That’s not what this arrangement says.  It’s a big bluff.  It’s actually not in the  arrangement and the problems that he will have when it comes to settling people in Papua New Guinea will  be all of those political issues and the Papua New Guinea government has complete right of veto and the  ability to pass laws that would prevent any number of people being resettled.  And the political issues -



GILBERT:

Aren’t you accusing the PNG Prime Minister of not being true to his word -



MORRISON:

No I’m not Kieran.



GILBERT:

He was there shaking the Prime Minister’s hand.



MORRISON:

No I’m accusing our Prime Minister of not being upfront with the Australian people.  There is no agreement  here and the Papua New Guinean Prime Minister’s certainly said there is no agreement.  He has never said  that everyone who comes to Papua New Guinea will be resettled if they’re found to be a refugee in Papua  New Guinea.  He has a right of veto.  Of course he would, we always said he would.  He always I’m sure

knew he would and he now has the difficult challenge of working through what conditions are going to be  placed on all of these arrangements and that’s always been the problem.  The other problem they have  Kieran is the capacity of getting people up into Manus Island and that is the other handbrake that Papua New  Guinea can put on this arrangement.  Kevin Rudd has created more beds in Australia for people coming on  boats in the last five weeks than he has established in Papua New Guinea and I think that tells the Australian  people where Kevin Rudd really stands on these issues.  He’s a fake, he’s not being fair dinkum with the  Australian people on this arrangement.



GILBERT:

Now one of the stories that was around yesterday, I want to get your thoughts on this and this is that two  percent of the Indonesian crew have been prosecuted, the vast majority sent back to Indonesia.  Now this is a  sensitive issue in Indonesia, because many of the crew are young men from fishing villages, naÃÂ¯ve to the  laws of Australia.  On the first offence, isn’t it appropriate that they be sent back if they’re, in many cases,  boys from poor fishing villages with no idea what the laws of Australia are?



MORRISON:  We’re not talking about children.  We’re not talking about minors.  We’re talking here -



GILBERT:  Some of them are.



MORRISON:  No, no.  The policy change which Nicola Roxon put in place was all first offenders, except those involved in  a serious incident or unless they were kingpin smugglers, would be sent back on the first offence.  Now  we’ve never raised specific objections about minors but when I was in Darwin last Friday, I visited the  Northern Immigration Detention Centre where the crews are held and I noticed that it was not as busy as it  used to be and I asked the question and it was confirmed to me, that this government has gone soft on those  who are running the boats to Australia.  I mean, what sort of a message does it send, Kieran, that if you  break Australian laws, our people smuggling laws, and you’re an adult, we won’t prosecute you.  But that is

the instruction it was reported was given by the Attorney General to the officials.  So, Kevin Rudd says he  wants to -



GILBERT:  Well this, as you know though, this is a very sensitive issue for the Indonesians.  You know that very well,  you’ve been there and you’ve had discussions with them.  They see that Australian law has been too tough  on many of the Indonesians involved in this who might have very little understanding of what our laws are  about.



MORRISON:  Well they’re our laws.  They’re our laws, Kieran, and they’re being broken, and our government has given a  leave pass to people who are breaking our laws.  And they say they’re tough on our borders but they have  brought charges on just 10 people of more than 500.



GILBERT:  But they’re not the kingpins are they?  They’re not the kingpins, these people.



MORRISON:  They’re breaking our laws, Kieran.  What are you saying we’re now not going to prosecute drug dealers  because they’re not the kingpins?



GILBERT:  No, I’m just saying - are you saying - they’re not the kingpins are they?  These are the, many of them young  people from poor fishing villages.



MORRISON:  Kieran.  They’re breaking our laws and our law must mean something.  That argument suggests that we  should say to drug dealers, well you’re not the Mr Bigs of the drug trade so we’ll just let you go.  Now that’s





Authorised and printed by Brian Loughnane, Cnr Blackall and Macquarie Sts BARTON ACT 2600

not how we run this country.  That’s not how you run your borders.  If someone has broken our laws, there  are separate processes for those who are minors, those who are under 18.  But we’re talking about adults  here who are breaking our laws.  They’re also breaking Indonesia’s laws because there are people smuggling  laws in that country as well.  And this was done in secret, it wasn’t advised to the Australian people and it’s  been running for about 18 months.  So  in the quiet, they’ve gone out there and they’ve said we’re not going  to prosecute first time offenders coming to Australia and I think that shows the real mettle of this  government when it comes to border protection.  And they’ve been exposed today again on the PNG  arrangement, the Nauru thing has unravelled and what the Australian people know is these guys just don’t  believe in it.  They’ll tell you something before an election and on the other side, they’ll go back to form.



GILBERT:   Only about a minute left, Scott Morrison.  I just want to get your thoughts on what John Howard had to say  yesterday regarding the need to take unilateral action, it was an endorsement of your view but does that also  mean aggravating the Indonesian bilateral relationship if need be?



MORRISON:  Well John Howard ran a very successful relationship with Indonesia for this reason; he had a relationship  built on respect, and if you’re going to have a relationship built on respect, you’ve got to respect yourself  and you don’t have a sort of sycophancy type relationship with your partners and your neighbours in the  region.  You’re very clear about your own interests, you’re very respectful of their interests but your own  sovereignty is something you always stand up for.  And I think that’s the sort of strength that you need in  dealing in countries, not only in our region but all around the world, that John Howard, Alexander Downer  certainly displayed and that’s the sort of strength you will see from a Coalition government under Tony  Abbott and with Julie Bishop in these important areas.



GILBERT:  Scott Morrison, thanks for your time.



MORRISON:  Thanks very much Kieran, good to be with you.
