GREG CARY:

The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. Welcome to you, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Nice to be here, Greg.

GREG CARY:

You’d feel pretty buoyed, I would think, after last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I do feel pretty good. It’s quite a challenge, going before a national audience, some critical journalists  and your principal political opponent for a full hour. But, I thought it went well. I thought I got a chance to  expose the chronic incompetence of this Government and the fact that the Prime Minister has no real  answers to the problems of the moment.

GREG CARY:

It is extraordinary pressure. Those of us on the outside, whether we are voters or whether we’re media, we  sometimes, we look and we get critical and the rest. But when you’re in the arena, up there, speaking last  night, an hour? You can’t afford one mistake. Everybody was waiting for one, that didn’t happen. So you’ve  got to be happy with that, too.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, that’s right, Greg. Look, I was a press secretary and a political adviser myself, some years ago, and  when you’re telling other people what to do, it’s very easy to always know exactly what should happen. I  have a very good team of highly professional staff and they’re always telling me exactly what I should be

2

doing and nine times out of ten, they’re right, but I sometimes think to myself, if it’s as easy as that, why  don’t you handle these questions?

GREG CARY:

What about the format itself last night? It seems very stodgy and I’d just rather see the two of you at it. What  would you like?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think David Speers did a very good job of moderating. He’s a particularly good journalist and he has  a lovely manner, but without being too aggressive or QC for the prosecution he does make you answer the  questions, he does put you on the spot, so I thought that David made the thing flow a bit better than might  otherwise be the case. Certainly, the one thing that I would probably suggest if I was asked, for future  debates, and you know Julia doesn’t want any more, I’d say that just keep the answers a bit shorter, I think  three minute answers can very easily become waffle.

GREG CARY:

Ok, by the way if you’d like to talk to Tony Abbott, you can. 13 13 32. Let me just ask you, just on last night  for a moment and then we will move onto other issues. What did you learn, what did your campaign learn,  perhaps, from what happened last night and the reaction from viewers and the inevitable deadly worm that  might influence you over the final weeks of the campaign, in terms of the issues you really highlighted?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, well, I guess when you’re a politician in Parliament, your main task is to destroy the argument of the  other side and yet when you are trying to appeal to the public, your main task is to explain how you are  going to solve their problems and, I guess, the right blend of being positive without letting the other side get  away with too much, that’s the challenge of those debates, to make your points about the utter  incompetence, the chronic waste that this Government has been responsible for, without sounding like  you’re just a carping opposition.

GREG CARY:

That’s a tough balance, isn’t it? Because every time you do start getting critical, the worm starts going  down. Is it even harder because you are up against a female Prime Minister? Is that gender issue an issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there’s no doubt that the Prime Minister did get an initial honeymoon and I think there were a lot of  people who were quite thrilled to see that there was no job in our country that a woman couldn’t get and do.  I mean, as a father of three daughters, Greg, I’m certainly pleased to have this demonstration of what we  always thought, this was a society that did not discriminate, but in the end, it’s competence, not gender that  people are interested in. And I think that the sad thing is that in that the month that Julia Gillard’s been the  Prime Minister, things have gone from bad to worse, it’s almost like bring back Kevin Rudd, the  Queenslander wasn’t so bad after all and didn’t deserve to be executed by the faction powerbrokers.

GREG CARY:

The point was made last night when you raised that point that you wouldn’t be the Leader of the Opposition  had not Malcolm Turnbull been removed, but they were clearly different circumstances.

3

TONY ABBOTT:

Very different circumstances. And it was about policy. But Julia Gillard made two points when she became  the Prime Minister, she said A that the Government had lost its way, which plainly it had, otherwise they  wouldn’t have sacked their leader, but B, she said there was no real differences between herself and the  Prime Minister on policy and she proceeded to prove that by completely mucking up the mining tax, the  boat people fix and the climate change fix.

GREG CARY:

Ok, we’ll get to callers in just a moment. One thing the worm did last night, it went up every time you  mentioned parental leave. So, it looks as thought you’re on a bit of a winner there, but to many of us, this is  one of your weakest policies and you’ve heard a lot about this, because it is a big new tax on business, it is a  government getting involved in a major way in people’s lives, up to $75,000 to stay at home for up to six  months. I’m just wondering how that gels with your personal philosophy of no big taxes and your party’s  philosophy of small government and personal responsibility.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well, the beauty of the paid parental leave scheme that we are putting forward, Greg, is that it is not  going to involve extra administration on business. It’s not going to involve that. There’s no paper work on  business. It will all be handled by the family assistance office, basically, all you need to go along, as  someone who is about to have a baby, you just need to go along to a family assistance office with a tax  return, a letter from your employer and a doctors certificate and the money will start to flow. So, no  paperwork on business, no real bureaucracy for government, so…

GREG CARY:

It’s still a tax though, isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s a levy.

GREG CARY:

That’s a tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

I accept that it is going to raise the costs for those businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $5 million a  year, companies with a taxable income of $5 million a year, I accept that, Greg. But, look, every benefit has  to be paid for and I think this is the least intrusive way of paying for a benefit which really is going to do an  enormous amount of good for families and, over time, it will be good for business because the beauty of this  is that it is an economic reform. It will boost population, it will boost productivity and it will boost  participation. So, over time, that will be very good for business.

GREGY CARY:

But does it pass the fairness test? Where somebody who is making $150,000 a year can stay at home and get  paid $75,000 a year.

TONY ABBOTT:

4

But if that person is sick, that person is paid sick pay at the rate of his or her salary. If you go on holidays,  you get paid at the rate of your salary. If you’re taking parental leave, why shouldn’t you be paid at the rate  of your salary?

GREG CARY:

Yeah, but coming from other people though, would be the obvious answer.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, my point is that, parental leave is a workplace entitlement, not a welfare entitlement. That’s why it  should be paid at the rate of your salary.

GREG CARY:

Does it not seem an anomaly to you though, that the Liberal Party, the free enterprise party, is going to end  up with company tax rates, for some companies, 31.7 per cent as opposed to Labor’s 29? So theirs will be  lower than yours.

TONY ABBOTT:

But the interesting thing about mine is this modest additional levy, it’s not going to cause any business to  change fundamentally what it is doing. Unlike the mining tax, which dramatically changes the profitability  of investing in Australia and therefore does change business behaviour. This is not a business behaviour  changing levy but it is a society behaviour changing levy and that’s what we want. We want to recognise  children, we want to help families and over time, we want a much more productive society.

GREG CARY:

Ok, this does feed into small business, too and I think many in small business, we’ve got thousands of those  listening to us now, probably figure they’re not hearing enough about small business, the engine room of the  Australian economy. Col has a question on that from Cairns, go ahead Col.

CALLER:

Hey mate, hey Tony, business is suffering mate. Can you tell me, do you think it’s fair that business has to  pay superannuation, after tax, and then that superannuation is added onto payroll and we get taxed again in  the way of payroll tax. Is that fair and reasonable to business?

TONY ABBOTT:

Col, I would be the last person to say that it’s easy to be in small business. It’s tough to be in small business.  And government does put big burdens on small business. What I want to do is not add to those burdens, I  mean I can’t necessarily change the market conditions you face, I can’t necessarily take lots of existing tax  burdens off you, but I don’t want to add to your burdens. One of the problems with the Labor Party’s  superannuation chance proposals, is they’re not going to be paid for by the mining tax, they’re going to be  paid for by every employer. Every employer over time is going to have to pay an additional three per cent in  superannuation, that is going to be a $20 billion a year slug on business, a $10 billion a year slug on small  business.

GREG CARY:

Small business, like a lot of others Tony, and you’re getting the same kind of feedback, are being strangled  by State charges and red tape and bureaucracy and the rest. Is there anything you can be doing about that?

5



TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I mean, we will certainly have more to say on small business in the course of this campaign, Greg. I  can’t say that we will entirely eliminate forests of paperwork, I wish I could, but as I said, my objective is  not to add to the burdens of small business and the Government will add to the burdens of small business, in  particular with this additional superannuation tax.

GREG CARY :

Tony Abbott, our guest, our telephone number 13 13 32. Shaun on the Gold Coast. Go right ahead.

CALLER:

Tony, good morning. Look, the question is basically, why isn’t the Opposition making more of a big deal  about the health system, given that, particularly in Queensland, it’s such a mess, I haven’t seen much  advertising about basically Kevin Rudd and now Julia Gillard’s promise of fixing up the health system.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, that’s a very good point and you haven’t seen enough advertising from the Coalition because,  unfortunately, we don’t nearly as much money to spend as the ALP, which are getting, which gets massive  funding from the union movement. I mean, we have to rely on a people’s campaign. They get massively  more funding than us, because of the rivers of gold pouring in from the trade union movement. But look, just  on the subject of health and hospitals, we will have a lot more to say about this in a week or so, but  essentially, the problem in the hospitals is too much bureaucracy, not enough beds. So what we’ll be  proposing is less bureaucracy and more beds and as I said, we’ll have more to say in a week or so.

GREG CARY:

Lot’s of talk, Tony, on immigration figures based on the Prime Minister’s notion, the sustainable future, but  it seems to be, and you’re both talking about it, sustainability is less to do with the number of people, but the  kind of infrastructure we have to service those people. Are you getting too bogged down with these figures?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the problem last week was that the Prime Minister wanted to talk about population and  sustainability , but she wasn’t prepared to talk about immigration and given that immigration contributes  two-thirds of our population increase, you can’t have a population debate, an honest one, and not also talk  about immigration. So what we did yesterday was inject some honesty into the debate by saying the number  that we would be having by the end of our first term…

GREG CARY:

But why that figure, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, because that would give us a population growth rate at about the long term average 170,000 migrants a  year would give us about a 1.4 per cent population growth rate and that’s the long term average.

GREG CARY:

Yeah. Does it resolve the problems, though, that we’re experiencing at the moment or is that coming back to  the question, is that an infrastructure problem, not a people problem?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, 170,000 is certainly a lot less than the 277,000 we had last year, and the 301,000 we had the year  before. I mean, immigration has gone up to absolute record levels under this Government, and they haven’t  been doing the hard work to receive such large numbers, because obviously the state Labor Governments  have not done the hard yards in infrastructure. We’re choking on our own traffic in cities like Brisbane, and  the other great cities of our country. So, it does have to be sustainable, and it does have to be firmly under  government control, and it does have to have the support of our public, and that’s what we were trying to do  yesterday. Let the public of Australia know that the government would run the immigration programme, the  government would set the numbers, and it would be done firmly in Australia’s national interest.

GREG CARY:

More of your questions in a just a moment. This ties in, of course, to the asylum seeker boat people question.  You said last night, categorically, that there will never be a processing facility on East Timor. You said that  with great certainty.

TONY ABBOTT:

Because the East Timorese just won’t have it. I mean, they have any number of leading East Timorese  politicians have said they don’t want it, and they won’t have it. And twice the East Timorese Parliament has  unanimously voted not to have a processing centre. Now, this was basically a Prime Ministerial thought  bubble. It was extraordinarily naive of the Prime Minister to make this announcement of the basis of a brief  late-night phone call to the President of East Timor, when it’s the Prime Minister of East Timor who  actually runs the Government. And she didn’t seem to know that.

GREG CARY:

Nadine from Ormiston. Question on education.

CALLER:

Yes, Mr Abbott. I was just wondering, I like Ms Gillard’s point regarding putting money into schools. I was  wondering, I’d rather see your rebate policy go into the schools. More teachers, refunds on tutoring,  improving the actual education, rather than sending the money back home. I would rather that go in to the  schools than refunding my child’s uniforms.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’s no reason why you can’t do both. I mean, the government puts many billions of money directly  into schools, and this is a relatively modest boost to parents. So, you know, we want to put more money into  schools where it’s affordable, but we certainly think that parents deserve some help as well, because just  about every family with kids is under cost of living pressure. And ok, it’s only a few hundred dollars, but  nevertheless I think parents find that very, very helpful. Particularly when you think that education costs  have gone up 17 per cent since late 2007.

GREG CARY:

Tony, one issue that hasn’t had a run so far, nuclear power. Can I ask you this question - at a time when  most comparable countries around the world are either introducing or expanding their nuclear power  facilities, both our major parties refuse to either debate the subject. Nick Greiner said last week that ruling  out nuclear power because of concerns about the impact on particular electorates was really juvenile. He  said it’s painfully obvious that if you wanted a rational approach, nuclear would have to be part of the  armoury. It’s just got to be part of it. Why won’t either of you show leadership on this question?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Greg, I’m perfectly happy to see a debate. I just, I’m not going to start a debate myself.

GREG CARY:

Why not?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because I don’t believe that we need it at this time. I mean, the reason why we don’t have a nuclear industry  in Australia is because we’ve never needed a nuclear industry in Australia, we have abundant reserves of  coal. We have large and increasing utilised reserves of gas. If we didn’t have the coal, if we didn’t have the  gas, if we were like France or Japan sure we would no doubt have a very large nuclear power generating  industry. But at the moment in Australia to generate power through nuclear would be quite a bit more  expensive, and let’s face it, electricity prices have gone up 35 per cent under the Rudd-Gillard Government.  The last thing we want to do is to put them up further, and if we were to change to nuclear that’s what would  happen.

GREG CARY:

And they’d run a hell of a scare campaign against you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, but, look, I am not theologically opposed to nuclear power. Never have been, never will be. If it’s in  Australia’s interest to have nuclear power, let’s have it. But at the moment we don’t need it, and if we did  have it, the price of power would go up even more than it’s already going up, thanks in part to the policies of  the Rudd-Gillard Government.

GREG CARY:

Terry in Auchenflower, go right ahead for Tony Abbott.

CALLER:

Good morning Greg, good morning Mr Abbott. Just checking in with you, if you would consider a dedicated  minister for small business, given that we make up 95 per cent of Australian business?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a very good question, and I can give you a categorical yes. In fact, I announced a few weeks ago that  there would be a dedicated small business minister in the cabinet. Bruce Billson is the Shadow Minister for  Small Business, he is in the Shadow Cabinet, and I very much hope that he will be the minister for small  business in a Coalition government after the 21 August. He will be in cabinet.

GREG CARY:

Tony, one of the issues, it wasn’t your fault it was that of those who were asking the questions I guess, and  the priorities last night. I was disappointed that so little time was spent on Afghanistan and our role there.  Writing in The Australian today Greg Sheridan, widely respected foreign affairs commentator, said this:  ‘We are a nation at war. Our young men in uniform are dying in battle. Hundreds of Australians are at direct  risk on the battlefield. Billions of dollars are being spent. But these realities could not penetrate the thick  wall of clichÃÂ©s and obfuscations both leaders erected around themselves last night.’ Can I ask you this  question. Both of you said pretty much the same thing, that we would stay the course because the cause is  worthy. But at the moment negotiations are going on with the Taliban to make them part of the new all party  solution there. And yet we’re fighting the Taliban to stop them getting back in to power. Now, if the Taliban  do get back in to power, and we are then gone, would we get back to get rid of them again, and if we  wouldn’t, why are we there now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we’re there now Greg, because Afghanistan was the international centre for Islamist terrorism. The  Bali bombers trained in Afghanistan, the September 11 bombers trained in Afghanistan, Osama bin Ladin  was headquartered in Afghanistan. So we are in Afghanistan, along with our allies, to stop Afghanistan once  again becoming a safe haven for terrorism.

GREG CARY:

But, with respect, they’re not there any more. Bin Ladin’s not there now, we are there now.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, that’s right. But, but if Afghanistan collapsed into complete anarchy, or if a Taliban government was  to restore itself, I think there is not the slightest doubt that international terrorism would once more use  Afghanistan as its principle base.

GREG CARY:

But, Tony, isn’t the logic of that that we should have an open-ended policy about staying there, when  NATO, the European countries, the United States, and by the sounds of it us, are already looking at exit  strategies?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the exit strategy is to win. That’s the exit strategy.

GREG CARY:

But no one really thinks we’re going to win. And what is winning?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’re not going to establish any time soon a liberal, pluralist, Western-style democracy in Afghanistan,  which in some respects is a pre-modern society. So, look, but we can get in Afghanistan a reasonably stable  government, which is not unduly monstrous to its own people, and which is broadly friendly to the West,  and which is resolutely opposed to allowing its territory to be used by terrorists.

GREG CARY:

But if we are negotiating with Taliban, final question on this for now and I’ll get one or two callers in before  you have to leave. If negotiations are ongoing to bring them into a government, and if once they’re in the  government they take over that government and assume control of Afghanistan, would we go back in to get  rid of them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think you can be confident, Greg, that there would be no negotiations that involved the replacement  of the Karzai Government with a Taliban government no negotiations to which Australia or the rest of the  Western alliance would be party to.

GREG CARY:

It’d be power sharing.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, look, breaking some people away from the Taliban is not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, if there are  people who circumstances have pushed into the arms of the Taliban who would prefer to join the right side,  that’s all well and good, surely.

GREG CARY:

Ian, final question from you this morning. Go right ahead.

QUESTION:

Hello, thanks Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, Ian, how are you?

QUESTION:

Not too bad, thank you, and yourselves?

TONY ABBOTT:

Not bad.

QUESTION:

Listen, I’m calling about the superannuation policy that the Howard Government had, probably the best  superannuation policy ever devised by any government. And the minute Labor got in they cut our salary  sacrifice from $100,000 down to $50,000 and from 2012 it will be down to $25,000. Will your government  restore a policy as good as that, or one that’s even better?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, it’s good to get that vote of thanks, and you’re right, I think that by the end of our term we did  have a very good policy on superannuation. Look, we will be putting out a comprehensive superannuation  policy well before the campaign is over. And look, there are lots of things, Ian, that we would like to do, but

10

a lot of it does depend on the fiscal position. Because benefits that you give, even tax concessions, do all  have a cost to the revenue. But look, thank you for being so generous about the Howard Government’s  superannuation policy, and let’s see what we can do for you in the course of the campaign.

GREG CARY:

You need to go. One final question, we’re four weeks away from the  -

TONY ABBOTT:

And look, just on superannuation. One policy we did announce last week was to ensure that all workers of  any age will get the superannuation guarantee levy. So if you’re a worker aged 71 or 72 you won’t miss out  on getting the superannuation guarantee levy money just because of your age.

GREG CARY:

Polls are much more encouraging today. What do you need to do over the next four weeks to get them going  in your favour?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, I think if every day I effectively point out what a hopelessly incompetent Government it’s been,  that doesn’t deserve to be re-elected, and if every day I can present people a credible alternative, doesn’t  mean we can change everything overnight for the better. But if people think that there are some important  things that will be better under us, well then I think we’ve got every chance of winning.

GREG CARY:

We’ll see you again before election day. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much, Greg.
