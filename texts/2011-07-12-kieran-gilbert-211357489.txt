E&OE

Subjects: Newspoll, carbon price, coal bid, asylum-seekers



KIERAN GILBERT: Let's go to our panel now. Deputy Opposition Leader in  the Senate, Senator George Brandis. And from Perth,  the Trade Minister, Craig Emerson.

Minister, first to you to ask you: the Prime Minister

obviously starts this fight well behind on every front. On  the tax you heard Martin saying 59 per cent of people  opposed to the idea. On the party support, well, this is  bottom, rock bottom, and on her own support, trailing.  So, on every front she's well behind.

CRAIG EMERSON: Oh well, of course, the criticism of governments in the  last few years is that they're poll-driven. We're not.  We're doing the right thing by the country and making  the transition to a clean energy future, Kieran.

But we were obviously under no illusions about the

size of the task, given the campaign particularly that Mr

Abbott has run. He has been telling people for months  and months, more than 20 times, that petrol will go up  by 6.5 cents a litre, and it's not true. And, of course, he  said that the coal industry will die under a carbon price.  And, of course, you've just said in your introduction,  Kieran, that there's been a very large takeover bid for  an important coal asset.

So Mr Abbott's scare campaign has obviously had

some effect, but now that the details are out, we'll be  explaining those very carefully to the Australian people.  So if I were the Coalition, I wouldn't be measuring up  the ministerial suites just yet.

GILBERT: Yeah, we'll get to that takeover bid because it does

seem the action doesn't match the coal industry's  rhetoric. But let's get Senator Brandis' view on this  Newspoll.

Look, Senator, obviously so far in front, the Coalition.

Is hubris the biggest risk at the moment?

GEORGE BRANDIS: Well, we understand that there's still probably more  than two years to go in this Parliament, unless the  Independents have a change of heart and decide to do  the right thing by their constituents, which they haven't  shown any sign of doing hitherto. So we're taking  nothing for granted.

It's early … it's early days yet as far as we're

concerned. I think what the polls obviously show is  complete collapse in public respect for Julia Gillard  because everyone in the country now knows that the  reason Julia Gillard is in The Lodge is because she lied  to them. Six days before the last election, she looked  down the barrel of a television camera and said there  Ã¢ÂÂwill be no carbon tax under the government I leadÃ¢ÂÂ.

And everybody now knows that this is a Prime Minister  whose word can't be trusted; they can't believe a thing  she says, and I think that's being reflected in her very  poor poll ratings.

GILBERT: Senator Brandis, what about this point that the Minister

referred to there: about Peabody Energy, the world's  biggest coalminer, launching a record bid for Macarthur  Coal? It hardly shows any concern about the future of  the industry under a carbon tax.

BRANDIS: Well, a couple of points to make about that, Kieran.

First of all, I don't think we should get carried away by  one market transaction, albeit a large market  transaction. Nobody ever said that the coal industry  was going to disappear overnight.

But, you know, this Government is held in power by a

political party, namely The Greens, whose declared  objective is to eliminate the Australian coal industry  over time. Some Green senators say that that should  happen within the next 10 years.

Now, the second point I'd make to you is that there

might be transactions between multinational coal  companies, but that's going to be of absolutely no  comfort to the 5,000 workers in the Australian coal  industry whose jobs will be lost, according to  independent economic assessments, as a result of the  coal tax; nor the 18 coal mines that will close because  of the carbon tax.

So I think that we need to make it … to make it

perfectly clear that this is a debate not about  transactions on the international stock exchanges; this  is a debate about the effect of the carbon tax on day-to-day Australians, on their costs of living, on their

livelihoods, and on their jobs. And one thing we know  for sure is that the coal industry will be massively  impacted as a result of this tax.

GILBERT: Craig Emerson, we obviously know the sensitivity on

both sides to this because yesterday the Climate  Change Minister went straight to the Hunter, coal-producing, coalmining area, and the Opposition Leader  and the Nationals Leader in the Senate, Barnaby  Joyce, both up in Singleton, similar area, making this  point.

EMERSON: Well, we've had George again saying, Ã¢ÂÂwell, the

coalmining industry is going to die over time; there's  going to be 18 coal mines closed…Ã¢ÂÂ

BRANDIS: No, no, I didn't say that, Craig. I said your alliance

partners wanted it to die over time.

EMERSON: Your leader did, your leader did. Your leader did, your

leader did. He said that the coal industry in Australia  will die over time. You've just said 18 coal mines will  close, thousands of people will lose their jobs. You've  got a major corporation that is voting with its

chequebook about the future of the coal industry in  Australia, and I'd rather believe actions of a major  corporation prepared to put up nearly $5 billion than  statements, George, from you and from Tony Abbott.

I'll remind your viewers, Kieran, that just a couple of

weeks ago - two weeks ago, on another matter -  George Brandis said that there'll be no live cattle  export import permits issued for three months. A  reckless statement, but in fact, they've been reissued.

Now, the point I'm making here is that the Coalition,

whether it be John … whether it be Tony Abbott or  George Brandis or any of them, will say anything and  do anything to try to scare people. The realities are  expressed in the marketplace. A very big vote of  confidence in the future of coal industry.

GILBERT: Okay, I want to ask you about something…

BRANDIS: I think it's fair enough for the Opposition to point out to

the public the consequences of your policies, Craig.  And the assessments that I've quoted were the Acil  Tasman assessments, an independent agency, not the  Coalition's assessments, that at least 5000 jobs will be  lost from the coal industry; up to 18 coal mines are at  risk of closure.

Now, you know, you might try and, you know, spin this

line, but you can't keep those facts away…

EMERSON: I'm not spinning any line. That's not spinning any line at

all.

BRANDIS: … from the families who are in the Illawarra and in the

Hunter and in Central Queensland and the Bowen  Basin who are going to be directly and immediately  impacted by your Government's policies.

GILBERT: Okay, let's look at another element of this.

EMERSON: This is not the only expression of confidence.

GILBERT: You've both had a good say on this. Minister, let me

finish this. Minister, please…

EMERSON: …there is a very large - can I just finish this? There is a

very large …

GILBERT: Minister, let me ask you the question, then you can

make your point.

EMERSON: All right, then I'll finish my answer. That's right.

GILBERT: Okay. You demand the Coalition provide savings. I

want to ask you a question, if I can get a word in on the  show. You demand the Coalition provide savings to  fund its $3.2 billion expenditure over the next four  years. Your package has found $4.3 billion. Where -  isn't that - doesn't that reflect double standards that  you're being so high and mighty about the Coalition's  $3.2 billion expenditure over four years, yet your  package has come up out of thin air with $4.3 billion.

EMERSON: Okay, I'll answer that, but I'll finish my previous answer.

What is the reality here for the coal industry is a  massive pipeline of new investment in coalmining in  Australia. That's the truth of the matter, and this $5  billion bid is just one example of that.

In terms of savings, budget savings, we have coming

up both a MYEFO, a mid-year economic fiscal outlook,  and also the regular Budget. In both of those, in both of  those you will see the return to surplus and you will see  how the Government is returning to surplus in 2012/13,  as we committed.

Now, Kieran, it's not $3.2 billion. The truth is Mr Abbott

has committed to a direct action plan that would cost  $10.7 billion, plus he has to buy $20 billion worth or  permits to hit the bipartisan target of a 5 per cent

reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with 2000  levels.

Now, that is a total of $30 billion, or $720 per

household. But it just got worse because on Sunday,  astonishingly, Mr Abbott said he would not under his  plan link any scheme to overseas carbon markets and  would not buy any permits from overseas. So he has to  now pursue even higher cost measures, which is an  even higher slug on taxpayers.

And of course, Mr Abbott won't say where the money's

coming from because he's already $11 billion in the  …  behind the eight ball…

GILBERT: Okay.

EMERSON: …as a result of unrepudiated election promises at the

last election…

GILBERT: Senator…

EMERSON: … as proven by Finance and Treasury.

GILBERT: Well, let's put this to Senator Brandis because he's …

the Opposition Leader is saying that he's not going to  back anything. But by the same token he's got to fund  his own commitments here, and that includes tax cuts;  that includes a direct action plan without buying the  cheapest abatement possible, overseas permits,  overseas abatement certificates.

And then on top of that, Senator Brandis, I want to ask

you … yesterday the Opposition Leader seemed to

claim credit for the steel assistance package, but then  says he's going to vote against it.

EMERSON: That'd be right. [Laughs]

GILBERT: Where's the logic in that?

BRANDIS: Well, Kieran, let's deal with each of those two issues in

turn. At the last election campaign, the Coalition took  $50 billion of expenditure reductions to the public and  …

EMERSON: Not true.

BRANDIS: Well, it is true - the $50 billion of expenditure

reductions. They were costed, they were documented,  they were independently verified. We will take a  package of expenditure reductions to the next election,  and that will be released at the appropriate time as we  come into the election cycle.

In relation to the carbon tax, we don't support it. I

mean, we don't support it. We don't support the  package, and what the Government is pleased to call  compensation is no compensation at all. I mean, as  Tony Abbott always says, compensation is what you  pay to people when you've injured them.

Now, and it doesn't wash with us. We think that this

carbon …

GILBERT: But he seemed to claim credit for the steel support

package and then says he's going to vote against it. It  doesn't seem logical.

BRANDIS: Well, I...

EMERSON: Weirder and weirder.

BRANDIS: … I didn't see the remarks of Mr Abbott to which you

were referring. But I can tell you this, Kieran, that the  Coalition's position is as simple as it could possibly be.  We will oppose this carbon tax. We will oppose these  measures because we believe they are very, very bad  for Australia. They are lethal for jobs, particularly in  sectors like the coalmining industry. They are lethal …

GILBERT: Okay, let's …

BRANDIS: … they are lethal for the cost of living. According to the

Treasury's own modelling, the Treasury's own  modelling, they'll increase the cost of living of the  average householder …

GILBERT: Okay, all right, we've got to take…

BRANDIS: … by more than $500 a year.

GILBERT: … we've got to take a quick break and we're going to

be right back. Stay with us on AM Agenda.

[Ad break]

GILBERT: Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me this morning,

the Shadow Attorney-General, Senator George  Brandis, and in Perth  the Trade Minister, Craig  Emerson.

Minister, let me ask you about something the Coalition

is making a lot of this morning, and this is the Finance

Minister, Penny Wong, was asked yesterday how  much will the carbon tax raise. The minister said about  $18 billion, from memory, over the forward estimates.  Christopher Pyne, the Opposition frontbencher,  corrected her to say it's $21 billion.

So the Finance Minister, you know, either a lapse of

memory or a mistake, a gaffe. But it shows you,  doesn't it, just how difficult it is for the Government to  not make mistakes in such a detailed policy argument  here?

EMERSON: Oh well, there's no doubt that this is a big reform and it

has a lot of detail around it. And obviously our task is to  explain to the Australian people how it would affect  them.

George finished his last comments there with cost-of-

living increases: 0.7 per cent is the cost-of-living impact  of this tax on the CPI. And on average, that would be  $9.90 a week. But the compensation on average is  $10.10 a week; for low-income earners, there's a 20  per cent buffer. So there's a few details that I think the  Australian people are interested in.

But I was really fascinated that George re-embraced

the $50 billion shonky savings figure that he says  justifies their move to scrap all of this and also,  interestingly, scrap the mining tax. Because you know  that $50 billion, Kieran, actually includes not  proceeding with income tax cuts for small businesses  and for corporations, but Tony Abbott keeps the mining  tax revenue. Isn't that curious? He keeps the mining  tax revenue, having pledged to get rid of the mining  tax, and yet counts as savings not providing tax cuts  for small business and companies across the board,

plus infrastructure spending, plus superannuation.  Shonky as all get-up.

GILBERT: We've had that debate. We have had that debate a few

times before.

EMERSON: Well, George keeps raising the $50 billion, and it is

shonky as all get-up.

GILBERT: Okay, let's move on. I want to ask Senator Brandis

about the promise to rescind the whole box and dice.  Once the tax is in place, the low-income - or the tax-free threshold - has increased, which most analysts are  saying that is a genuine reform - pulling people out of  the tax system. It's very hard to rescind, isn't it? It does  resemble the promise of Kim Beazley a few years ago  to roll back the GST.

BRANDIS: Well, I mean, that's our commitment. And can I just

make this observation, please Kieran? The  Government and the spin doctors keep calling this a  reform. It's not a reform. It's a setback. Anything that  forces up the cost of living; that throws people out of  work by their thousands in some of Australia's great  industries; which makes Australia less internationally  competitive, for no good purpose, for no environmental  impact …

EMERSON: George, two years ago you supported it.

BRANDIS: … with no environmental impact whatsoever is not a

reform, it's a setback. This is a redistribution of wealth  policy masquerading as a reform to improve the  climate. It's nothing of the sort. It won't have … make  one iota of difference on global temperatures.

Now, in relation to our overall attitude to this package,

we think that it is a package based on a lie,

constructed around a bad idea, and we are completely  un … we think we are … we're unashamed about  opposing it. And, in fact, we think we are doing what an  opposition should do in protecting the public interest  against a government that promises one thing and  does the opposite …

GILBERT: Okay.

BRANDIS: … in committing to rescind it.

GILBERT: Well, we are almost out of time. There's one last

issue…

EMERSON: George was one of the strongest advocates.

GILBERT: … I want to get to, and we've only got about a minute

each to respond to this, if I can keep the reins on this  one. The asylum-seeker issue.

It looks like the message might be getting through,

Minister. The … a group of Sri Lankan asylum-seekers  with signs saying, “we need New Zealand”, apparently  intercepted by Indonesian authorities on their way  …  hoping to get to Indo … hoping to get to New Zealand,  I should say. Is this a good sign?

EMERSON: Oh look, let's just wait and see. I do want to finish with

this remark on what George just said. Two years ago,  he was a very strong advocate of what he now calls a  bad idea. That is an emissions trading scheme …

BRANDIS: That's not … that is a lie, Craig.

EMERSON: …under Malcolm Turnbull. You were a very strong

advocate.

BRANDIS: I'm sorry, you can't …  you just can't, you just can't,

you just can't lie to people like that, Craig.

EMERSON: You were a very strong advocate of an emissions

trading scheme, as John Howard was…

BRANDIS: I've never been a supporter of the carbon tax at any

time.

EMERSON: …as he sought to introduce. It's an emissions trading

scheme and you know it is. And on the question … you  were a supporter of an emissions trading scheme, and  that's what this is. You supported it two years ago …

BRANDIS: No, it's not, Craig. It's not an emissions trading

scheme.

EMERSON: …your leader, John Howard, supported it…

BRANDIS: It's a carbon tax from a government who promised not

to introduce one.

EMERSON: … of course it is. Go and have a look; read it up. Read

up, read up a few documents rather than your  propaganda sheet.

GILBERT: Okay. Now Minister, if I can get you to answer the

question. I feel like Harry Jenkins this morning …

EMERSON: Yeah look, on the asylum seeker issue - sorry? Yeah,

you do. Mr Speaker! Mr Speaker! Order! Order!  Relevance! Relevance!

GILBERT: I feel like Harry Jenkins because you're ignoring the

question. Please, answer the question.

EMERSON: Look, we will do whatever we can to ensure that

people don't make this risky journey. People's lives  have been lost. There's an inquiry going on now. If the  announcements that we've made have provided a  deterrent effect, all the better. Because we don't want  people to risk their lives and pay people smugglers to  come across those oceans. And, you know, there have  been tragedies. And if this has had some effect  already, well, that's a good thing.

GILBERT: Senator Brandis, what do you make of that: the fact

that this group was heading to New Zealand? It seems  that the message might be getting through.

BRANDIS: Well look, you know, this is one instance. We don't

know all the facts. But I'll tell you what facts we do  know. There wasn't a problem before this Government  weakened the Howard Government's policies in 2008.  In all the years since, many lives have been lost. More  than 150 boats have arrived. Today there are more  than 6,000 people in immigration detention, including  1,000 children. This has been a monumental policy  failure because this Government didn't have the policy  courage to stick to the tough policies that the Howard  Government had introduced and had proven to be  successful.

GILBERT: Okay. Senator Brandis, …

EMERSON: How quickly they forget the SIEV-X  and the “Children

Overboard” affair.





GILBERT: …Trade Minister. Trade Minister and Senator

Brandis, thank you very much for a feisty  discussion, as always.

EMERSON: Okay, thanks, Kieran.

GILBERT: That's all for this edition of AM Agenda.
