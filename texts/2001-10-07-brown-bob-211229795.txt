Greens Condemn Howard and Ruddock

Greens Senator Bob Brown has condemned the Prime Minister and Phillip Ruddock for their handling of the latest boatload of asylum seekers.

“Howard’s One Nation policy of ‘turning the boats back’ is causing the situation to spiral ever further out of control,” Senator Brown said today.

“The latest incident, with people jumping or being thrown overboard, is a direct outcome of Mr Howard’s policies which have made refugees election fodder.

“Mr Ruddock’s pronouncements today are media manipulation of the worst sort. Nobody throws their children overboard unless they are desperate.

“Australia is being hugely damaged by a policy that has already cost $100M and the results of which would have been the same: cheats sent home with genuine refugees remaining in Australia.

“This is not an exercise in war it is an exercise in politics. Howard’s approach has snarled one third of the Australia Navy when they should be available for others uses,” Senator Brown said.
