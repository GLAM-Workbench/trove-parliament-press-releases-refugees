ALSF Address - "It’s Not My Fault"   Tuesday, 03 July 2012 11:00

Address to the Australian Liberal Students Federation Annual Conference 2012

University of Sydney, Sydney

Thank you very much, Christian. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s great to be back with ALSF. It reminds me of a misspent

youth. It also reminds me of some very worthwhile activities that myself and some others

engaged in because, you might find it surprising, that Liberal Students believed in Compulsory

Student Unionism until 1977. I know thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s not in your lifetime. But 1977 was when a group of

us took over ALSF Ã¯Â¿Â½ and might I say, since then it has always been in the hands of what we

describe as Ã¯Â¿Â½solid citizensÃ¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½ and I am sure it will continue to remain so.

So to those of you who are willing to identify on campus as Liberal Students, can I say thank

you and congratulations because it is tough, you do stand out from the crowd. But, can I tell

you, one Ã¯Â¿Â½ itÃ¯Â¿Â½s a great training ground; two Ã¯Â¿Â½ you meet some very good people, especially at

conferences like this and they will remain life-long friends and you will be surprised, after

university, you might lose contact with some of them and then they reappear 20 years later at

the same Federal Parliament as is the case with myself. Can I suggest, that you make every use

of the benefits that you have at this ALSF conference and at future conferences to build up your

networks, to make friendships Ã¯Â¿Â½ because they will last a lifetime and they will be undoubtedly of

mutual individual benefit but I would also like to think of real benefit of our nation as a whole.

It seems that we all need to grow up. As children, we often like to blame our siblings, the

family pets or some other intervening person, thing or event to escape personal responsibility.

Today, I want to celebrate taking personal responsibility. In celebrating personal responsibility,

we actually oppose the nanny state. We oppose the stifling notion that others owe us a living or

that we are never the architects of our own misfortune.

We also oppose the notion that we donÃ¯Â¿Â½t bear responsibility for the needs of others. That is,

why you will see the left-wing activist on the street corner with a placard demonstrating against

world poverty, whilst the conservative quietly donates some of his income to the less fortunate.

In recent years, there has been an unhealthy trend to outsource our responsibilities to the

euphemistic Ã¯Â¿Â½theyÃ¯Â¿Â½, or Ã¯Â¿Â½the governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½. How often have we heard Ã¯Â¿Â½theyÃ¯Â¿Â½ should do

something about it? Or Ã¯Â¿Â½the governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½ should do something about it?

The journalists regrettably never stop to ask the usually emoting person whoÃ¯Â¿Â½s all care and

concern what they are doing personally or where does individual responsibility cut in. LetÃ¯Â¿Â½s take

the scourge of gambling and especially poker machines, I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know how often IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve seen

people on the TV screen arguing against poker machines, Ã¯Â¿Â½they should be bannedÃ¯Â¿Â½, Ã¯Â¿Â½they

should be limitedÃ¯Â¿Â½, they should be all sorts of things, but not once, not once have I heard him

say people actually need to take control of their lives. The poker machine is static, it is the

individual that walks up to it and decides to put money into it.

Do I like poker machines, do I like gambling? No, but there is also the individual responsibility

aspect which is always airbrushed out of the arguments and never talked about.

It seems that we need to limit everything and everyone but the actual person responsible for

his or her gambling habit. In the media reporting, I still await the journalist asking Ã¯Â¿Â½what

responsibility do you take?Ã¯Â¿Â½, Ã¯Â¿Â½why is the situation not your fault?Ã¯Â¿Â½.

How can you blame the company which puts the poker machine there when the vast majority

of people gamble responsibly or within their means. So, is it the machineÃ¯Â¿Â½s fault? Or is it the

personÃ¯Â¿Â½s fault?

IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just waiting for the defence lawyer to come up with the idea of blaming the TV series Top

Gear for his clientÃ¯Â¿Â½s excessive speeding. Do we say that it was Top GearÃ¯Â¿Â½s fault because Ã¯Â¿Â½I

watched it too much, I tried to emulate it and therefore I got onto the road and started

speedingÃ¯Â¿Â½. Well, you are responsible when you get behind the wheel of the car. Similarly when

you get behind or in front of a poker machine, you are similarly responsible.

Regrettably, we have this victim mentality becoming firmly entrenched within our community

and it really does need to be debunked. My colleague, Joe Hockey recently gave a very good

speech about the Age of Entitlement, and ending the age of entitlement and he was right.

Because your entitlement is made available on the back of somebody elseÃ¯Â¿Â½s disentitlement and

of course you would be aware of that in relation to Compulsory Student Unionism and that is a

classic case in point. The compulsion for the so-called Ã¯Â¿Â½common-goodÃ¯Â¿Â½, as determined by the

elite is obtained by subjugating gating the individualÃ¯Â¿Â½s right from his money and access to an

education. SomeoneÃ¯Â¿Â½s right to social security is also obtained by forcing someone else to give up

some of their wealth that they have earned or created. That is why mutual obligation as

introduced by the Howard Government is such an important concept to ensure that safety nets

donÃ¯Â¿Â½t turn into hammocks or lifestyles.

When the Government supplies or indeed the company supplies or guarantees something, the

incentive to look after that thing supplied is seriously diminished. Take the use of company cars.

If you own it, if youÃ¯Â¿Â½re responsible, if you have to pay the excess on the insurance claims, you

look after that car a bit better than if you know itÃ¯Â¿Â½s just the bossÃ¯Â¿Â½ or the companyÃ¯Â¿Â½s car or the

governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½s car.

Now in an excellent book, Dambisa MoyoÃ¯Â¿Â½s How the West was Lost, explores how it was within

the US Government guaranteeing the mortgage institutions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that

meant bondholders were less robust in vetting peopleÃ¯Â¿Â½s ability to absorb their mortgage

payments. And of course, if you think about it, if big government guaranteeÃ¯Â¿Â½s the mortgages,

then those who are doing the lending donÃ¯Â¿Â½t feel as responsible because thereÃ¯Â¿Â½s that safety net,

that soft landing in the event things go haywire. And itÃ¯Â¿Â½s very interesting, she postulates about

the possibility of there not having been a sub-prime mortgage collapse and a GFC if there were

not these government guarantees.

So even in the corporate world, government guarantees to relieve people of their individual

responsibility creates problems and we are now seeing that with a former Geelong Grammar

School student seeking damages from her former school after she failed to qualify for her

preferred university course.

Of her time at Geelong Grammar, she said: ''I didn't ever feel I was getting the support I

needed to really excel.''

Her mother is also suing the school for lost income and other expenses.

We can all understand disappointment in not getting into oneÃ¯Â¿Â½s chosen university or choice of

course but surely this sort of court action is just ridiculous. The twist in this story is that the

student could have studied her chosen degree at a range of other universities, not to mention

that it appears she wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t the brightest student in any event.

In my own portfolio of Workplace Relations, I recently learnt courtesy of a Standards Australia

report that gender bias could occur when employees described, analysed, evaluated and graded

jobs. Indeed, some job titles imply a gender bias Ã¯Â¿Â½ like fireman or secretary. As a result, we have

more potential victims, more potential people who have been discriminated against.

In the GovernmentÃ¯Â¿Â½s harmonisation of Occupational Health and Safety laws, the Government

is currently developing codes of practice Ã¯Â¿Â½ one in particular, is the bullying code, and this

entrenches this culture of victimisation.

The code countenances the following scenario: where an employer unintentionally bullies me, I

don't consider it to be bullying but another sensitive employee has observed this and he actually

interprets this behaviour as bullying Ã¯Â¿Â½ albeit it was unintentional and it wasn't taken as bullying

but the sensitive employee did see it as bullying, he would be entitled to compensation,

counselling and all the rest.

If all that isn't bad enough, I trust that you may have heard of a recent Federal Court case

about the public servant injured on her work trip whilst engaging in some vigorous horizontal

activity. She engaged in this activity after hours in her free time and she injured herself in that

vigorous activity.

The Judge said words to the effect that if she was sitting in her hotel room playing cards and

got a paper cut she would have been entitled to workers compensation. As a result, premiums

go up. As a result, you have another statistic for workers compensation and a workplace injury

to show how bad Australian workplaces are and how unsafe they are.

It begs the question, if the employer is responsible, should the employer have a right to

supervise the activities. The Judge never allowed the logic of his conclusions to go that much

further.

But more seriously, what type of mentality is that encouraging? And to boot, the public servant

was a human resources manager. So what a fine example she sets to all those she is seeking to

manage. One would have thought that time off was your own time and if you were having time

off at home, playing cards, and got a paper cut you shouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t get workers compensation.

Similarly, if you are travelling and have time out, sitting in your hotel room playing cards and get

a paper card, it should not be workers compensation nor should the other injury.

One of the other problems we have is that we do have less than objective journalists in the

media claiming the government is the victim of a non-cooperative Opposition, I simply ask you

who did the deal for Government? It was Ms Gillard and for those of us who remember after

2010, Ms Gillard was touted as this wonderful, skilled negotiator that outfoxed Tony Abbott. That

she had undoubtedly honed those skills while an Industrial Lawyer at Slater and Gordon and she

was marvellous at being able to negotiate her way through. The fact is, she sold her soul on a

whole range of issues and those problems are coming back to haunt her and we as an

opposition should have cooperated!? Where are all these wonderful negotiating skills that she

allegedly had? Surely they could have been put to good use, yet an asylum seeker policy

couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t get through the Parliament.

Similarly, the alleged poll deficit from which the Government is suffering is from the

unrelenting negativity of Tony Abbott and the Opposition and a lot of the commentators say,

Ã¯Â¿Â½poor old Julia Gillard and the Labor Government, theyÃ¯Â¿Â½re suffering because&Ã¯Â¿Â½, never do they

ask Ã¯Â¿Â½are they the architects of their own problem, namely did they lie to the electorate? Did they

sell themselves out and as a result now no longer have the trust of the Australian people?Ã¯Â¿Â½.

Now, before I get too melancholy about this trend, the great thing is that you are present here

today because you are into the business of self-improvement, you are into the business of

having values and ideals and willing to stand up for them. It is the ideals and values of

Liberalism that says there is such a thing as individual responsibility. So what I would invite you

as individuals to do is, donÃ¯Â¿Â½t let victimhood seduce you if at first, you donÃ¯Â¿Â½t succeed at whatever

you try to achieve in life.

Similarly, donÃ¯Â¿Â½t encourage the victim status in others, well-meaning though it may be. Often

when people want somebody to hear them out, often they want you to say Ã¯Â¿Â½you were hard done

byÃ¯Â¿Â½. Rather remind them difficulties occur in life, and if we allow everybody that has a

misfortune in life be described as a victim, we will become a nation of victims as opposed to a

nation of innovators, a nation of people who are self-reliant, who want to achieve and it is

ultimately the sum-total of all self-reliance of all individual achievements that makes your nation

self-reliant, that makes your nation an achieving nation. A nation that is not in debt, a nation

that has a positive outlook in the world, a nation that can make a genuine contribution to the

world. If I might say, the Western civilisations have done exactly that for humanity and

victimhood has not been part of it until recent times and we need to fight against victimhood.

In short, outsourcing consequences inhibits the taking of responsibility.

So letÃ¯Â¿Â½s celebrate that great Liberal virtue of self-reliance, take on individual responsibility and

spread that message wherever you go because at the end of the day, that is whatÃ¯Â¿Â½s going to

determine our individual success, our societyÃ¯Â¿Â½s success and our nationÃ¯Â¿Â½s success.

Thank you very much for hosting me this morning.
