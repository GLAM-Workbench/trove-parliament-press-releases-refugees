PRESS STATEMENT BY PHILIP RUDDOCK MP SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

â€œThe decision to allow Vietnamese students to study in

Australia is yet a further example of the Hawke Government's

appeasement of Hanoi.

"Mr Hayden's decision shows a total insensitivity to the

local Australian Vietnamese community. At the very least

it is an unnecessarily provocative act.

"The Vietnamese in Australia are the victims of the

brutal communist dictatorship in Hanoi.

"It is not surprising that Australian Vietnamese should

regard Mr Hayden's latest gesture to Hanoi as a deeply

disturbing development.

"I call on the Foreign Minister to assure all Australians

that these Vietnamese students will not be allowed to

gather information on Australian Vietnamese for use against

their remaining family members in Vietnam.

"Unless a firm guarantee can be given, the programme should

be terminated immediately.

"The fact that the presence of these students has upset the

local Vietnamese community and presented unacceptable settlement

problems should be enough to make the Hawke Government think again

"It is outrageous that the Government should be assisting the

Vietnamese Communist regime in this way while Hanoi:

.  ... 2.  .

.2 .

.  Continues to pursue brutally repressive policies at home

including the incarceration of thousands of political

prisoners in concentration camps;

.  maintains a 200,000 strong army of occupation in Cambodia;

.  has encroached into Thailand;

.  is actively waging war on the refugee camps on the

Thai border - including those of the non communist

Sihanouk and the anti-communist Son Sann.
