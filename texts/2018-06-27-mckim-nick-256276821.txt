Cuts to services for people seeking asylum

June 27, 2018

The cuts to support for people seeking asylum in Australia are unconscionably cruel and designed to force people into  poverty, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

“Cutting the status resolution support service will force people into poverty, homelessness and exploitative jobs,”  Senator McKim said.

“Unfortunately, it is a continuation of Peter Dutton’s determination to punish migrants, particularly refugees and people  seeking asylum.”

“To retrospectively punish people in this way is unconscionably cruel.”

“While these are difficult times for people seeking asylum, it’s heartening to see so many Australians raising funds and  offering accommodation for people affected by the cuts.”
