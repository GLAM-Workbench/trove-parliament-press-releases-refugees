Australian Protective Service “AS YE SOW, 
SO SHALL YE REAP”

Â

“The plummeting morale in the Australian P rotective Service 
is no surprise,” Shadow Justice and Customs Minister, Duncan Kerr, 
said today.

Â

Mr Kerr was responding to reports that four APS officers 
have been suspended for allegedly drinking and sleeping on duty outside 
Kirribilli House.

Â

“Before the Howard Government began hacking away 
at APS funding and resources, the APS had consistently won awards, year 
in and year out, for being Australia’s best security organisation 
- but the Government’s slash and burn approach has changed all that,” 
Mr Kerr said.

Â

“Areas which used to be exclusively covered by the 
APS, such as the Port Hedland detention facility and some regional airport 
security operations, including Hobart airport, have now been opened 
up to public tender, creating retrenchments, loss of senior managers 
and decimating pride of service within the APS.

Â

“Where once the APS was regarded as Australia’s 
premier security and protection agency, we are coming to the 2000 Olympics 
with the prime anti-terrorism body on the brink of collapse.

Â

“The Federal Government loves to boast about savings 
achieved though outsourcing, but the reality is there are some aspects 
to national security that shouldn’t be allowed to run down. The reported 
incident at Kirribilli highlights what can go wrong.

Â

“The APS is not being allowed to have pride in its 
work. Its current size is below the critical mass required to sustain 
adequate training programs to allow career development.

Â

“And, yet again, who is the Minister responsible 
for this? Senator Amanda Vanstone.

Â

“With the ongoing fiasco over illegal boat arrivals, 
the bungled detention of two Federal Labor MP’s, attacks on diplomatic 
facilities in Sydney, and now guards at Kirribilli said to be found 
drinking and asleep, the Prime Minister must be running out of excuses 
for his Minister for Justice and Customs. Unfortunately, Australian 
security can’t wait,” Mr Kerr said.
