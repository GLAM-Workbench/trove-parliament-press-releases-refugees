Coalition’s demonising of refugees continues in  desperate race to the polls

The Coalition’s announcement today that it will alert the police when refugees are released into the  community is unabashed and unashamed dog-whistle politics, the Australian Greens have said.

“The Coalition’s shameful parade of asylum policy announcements has continued unabated into the  final week of the election campaign,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“It has been shown repeatedly that refugees are no more likely to commit crimes than the general  population, but that hasn’t stopped the Opposition from whipping up fear at every opportunity.

“It is reckless to incite tensions in the community in this way. There are already controls and  protections put in place, known as Australian law, which apply to everyone in Australia equally.

“When the Opposition first floated this policy, it was the Australian newspaper’s Dennis Shanahan  who said they had gone too far. In his words, “are they supposed to wear a scarlet letter ‘A’ for  'asylum seeker'?”

“This announcement has nothing to do with looking after the community or refugees. It’s all about  fear-mongering six days out from election day.”
