TONY ABBOTT:

It’s really good to be here in the electorate of Griffith. It’s great to be here in Queensland. This is a really  important state. Increasingly, it's - along with Western Australia - the economic powerhouse of our  Commonwealth and it is good to be with people who want to give Australia the better government that it  deserves.

Every day I am talking to my fellow Australians about the Coalition's plans to give us a strong and  prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. That is what I am on about every day. I think the  Australian public want the budget under control, I think they want our borders under control and the  Coalition has the plans to do precisely that.

But we can't win an election without really outstanding local candidates and Bill Glasson is the best of the  best. You could not find anyone who has served our country more enthusiastically and to more effect than  Bill Glasson. He's been a very senior ophthalmologist here in Queensland for a long, long time,  the President of the Australian Medical Association, President of the College of Ophthalmology, served in  the Army Reserve. The other day I was up in Queensland and I thought I should come out and do a bit of  campaigning with Dr Bill. I rang his campaign team and I found out that he was overseas helping people in a  refugee camp. Now, this is the kind of Australian, this is the quality of man who is representing the LNP  here in the seat of Griffith and without being in any way critical of the sitting member, I can guarantee you  that Bill Glasson does not see this seat as a stepping stone to anything else. He sees serving the people of  Griffith as a wholly honourable, wholly noble objective and that is what he will do if he is elected to  represent this seat.

I will ask him to say a few words and then I will take some questions.

DR. BILL GLASSON:

Thanks Tony, thanks very much indeed. First and foremost, I just once again want to thank the people of  Griffith for the opportunity to stand as the LNP candidate and as I have said to them, as I walk around the

electorate, I hear these issues over and over again. First of all it’s about the cost of living, the pressures on  families, the pressure in paying their utility bills, their electricity and gas etcetera, it's hurting young  families. It is also hurting our self-funded retirees. These are people on fixed income. These are people who  actually have put money aside to try to ensure that they're not a burden on the state; that they can fund their  future existence. They are hurting, ladies and gentlemen. They are hurting. If you go to any local business  and ask them how they're travelling: "Bill, it is tough. It’s tough. We get a bit of business on Friday and  Saturday but during the week there is very little.” So, the clear message out there: we need a change, ladies  and gentlemen. I want to be part of that change and I want to take the people of Griffith with me. So, I thank  you for the opportunity and I thank you, Tony, for your kind words and I look forward to becoming part of  your team.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Bill. Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the Newspoll shows your personal standing is not great at the moment. Do you think this is the  result of attacks from Labor and what are you going to do about it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I am just not going to stoop to engaging in the kind of nasty personal commentary that we have seen  far too much of. Every day I am talking to the people of Australia about what we in the Coalition can do to  improve their lives. I am talking about getting the Federal Budget under control because how can  Australians get their budgets under control if the Federal Government can't get its budget under control? I  am talking to people about how I can take the pressure off their cost of living by eliminating unnecessary  taxes such as the carbon tax. That’s what I am going to be doing every day between now and the next  election.

QUESTION:

Why do you think the Australian people have such a high disapproval of you at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, as I said, I am just not going to get into the business of responding to the endless personal attacks. I  will leave that to the Labor Party and I am going to talk about the things that matter to the Australian people.  I know that Labor has no positive policies for our country. I want to talk about how our country can be  better. I want to talk about how we can give a great people the better government they deserve.

QUESTION:

Senator Brandis has come out here this morning and talked about how well the Coalition is going in the  polls. Why do you think there’s such a vast disparity between the Coalition’s polling and your personal  polling?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, you can all see how this government conducts itself. You can see the relentless negativity of the  Government but I am just not going to get into the business of commentary on the Government. I just want  to talk about how we can be a better country, how we can give new hope to the Australian people, how  Australians can be their best selves in the years to come and I think the best years of this country are ahead  of us and I want to help to make that happen for the whole of the Australian people.

QUESTION:

Do you start to think yourself, do you start to wonder why the polls are so bad, why people don't like you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am not sure that I entirely accept the premise of that question, but suffice to say every day I am working as  hard as I humanly can for a better country, with a stronger government and come election day, people will  be focused on this government's record, not on its spin.

QUESTION:

Tony, what do you think of the Glass-Steagall proprosal to solve the problems with the banking situation  where the banks are handling both derivative and the commercial and mortgage side of things?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don't want to go into the technicalities of the former Glass-Steagall Act, suffice to say that banks in  Australia have always been much better regulated than banks in the United States and the good situation of  Australian banks is largely the result of common sense behaviour from Australian bankers and good  regulation, much of which was put in place by the former Howard Government.

QUESTION:

The Royal Commission has been announced by the Prime Minister. There seems to be some concern about  timelines and also the broad ranging nature of it. Do you have any idea about whether it should be narrowed  down, the terms of reference, or what the terms of reference should be?

TONY ABBOTT:

I support what the Prime Minister announced yesterday. I am pleased that we were able to say earlier in the  day that should any wide-ranging Royal Commission be announced, it would be wholly supported by the  Opposition and that remains the case. I understand that the terms of reference have yet to be finalised. The  Royal Commissioner or Commissioners have yet to be chosen but I think this is a step towards healing; an  important step towards healing. We support it. We encourage it. We want it to do its work well. We want it  to look at child abuse, the evil of child sexual abuse, wherever it has taken place.

QUESTION:

We have got an inquiry going in Queensland that has the powers of a Royal Commission. I think there is  another state that's having a parliamentary inquiry. Do you think there is a chance of some overlap here or a  possibility that maybe the Queensland inquiry can take on extra powers of the Royal Commission to save  costs?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s essentially a matter for the Prime Minister. I think the important thing is that tens of thousands of  people who have not been as well cared for as they should have been; who have been badly let down by  people in authority over the years will feel that their heartfelt cries for justice have at least been heard. I  think, as I said earlier, this can be a time of healing for our country and I very much support what has been  done.

QUESTION:

Do any of the revelations that have come out about the Catholic Church, do they at any point start to shake  your faith?

TONY ABBOTT:

There have been over the years some shattering revelations about a number of highly respected institutions,  including, of course, my own church. I know that the current leadership of the church is determined to get to  the bottom of this. I know that the current leadership in all of our great institutions are determined to stamp  out this evil wherever it takes place and to get to the bottom of any previous systemic failures. I know that is  the case and I fully support people in that.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you pushed for a serving Northern Territory minister to become a federal member. She would be  the first female MP to be an indigenous Australian. Why did you do that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Alison Anderson is a remarkable Australian, a truly remarkable Australian. She is charismatic. She is  inspirational. I would love to see the first indigenous female member of the Federal Parliament be a member  of the Coalition I lead. I would love to think that a highly traditional Australian Aboriginal who is  nevertheless charismatic and inspirational in modern Australia as well might enter the Federal Parliament  but who the candidates are is ultimately a matter for the lay party and, in this case, is ultimately a matter for  the Country Liberal Party.

QUESTION:

You made some comments about Ken Wyatt saying he's not a man of culture. What did you mean by those  comments in relation to what you’ve just said about Alison Anderson?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, I think it is very important that the Aboriginal people of Australia are represented in our decision-making institutions, including the national Parliament. Now, I am very proud that the first indigenous  member of the House of Representatives is Ken Wyatt, who entered the Parliament for the Liberal National  Party, for our Coalition. I think it would be terrific if, as well as having an urban Aboriginal in our  Parliament, we had an Aboriginal person from Central Australia, an authentic representative of the ancient  cultures of Central Australia in the Parliament but, as I said before, it is a matter for the Country Liberal  Party and whoever the Country Liberal Party determine their candidate to be will have my full support.

Thank you.
