STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE FEDERAL OPPOSITION, THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY 
MP

Â

Â

KOSOVO

Â

Â

The Opposition welcomes this afternoon’s announcement by the Prime 
Minister that the Government will accept 4,000 temporary refugees from  
Kosovo. I have already given the Prime Minister my in-principle support 
for passage of the requisite legislation.

Â

The Government’s response is an important development 
in light of the worsening situation and appalling conditions in and 
around Kosovo. However, in response to a formal request from UNHCR, 
the Government should also consider boosting the permanent humanitarian 
intake of refugees. Borrowing from next year’s program may be a consideration, 
as was the case in 1995-96 during the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis.

Â

We also welcome the $4 million boost in funding to 
aid agencies. There may be a requirement for further funding as the 
crisis escalates.

Â

It is important that President Milosevic not be rewarded 
for his actions and the actions of his Government and the military. 
A lasting solution whereby Albanians and Serbians can live together 
must be found.
