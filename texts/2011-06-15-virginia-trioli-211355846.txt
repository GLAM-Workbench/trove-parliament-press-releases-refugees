E&OE ONLY

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Now the Health Minister Nicola Roxon joins us now  from Canberra.

Minister, good morning. Thanks for joining us.

NICOLA ROXON:   Good morning.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Have you managed to establish how it was that Philip  Morris was invited to that fundraiser?

NICOLA ROXON:   Oh no, look and clearly it was an error. Clearly they  shouldn't have been sent. I can obviously confirm - and I've gone back and  checked all of the records - that they did not attend and no donations were  received because, of course, our party has had a ban since 2004. And so  clearly they were sent in error.

But obviously I need to make the point that none of this is going to divert our  government from taking action on plain packaging. But obviously there's going  to be a lot that's going to go in and out of this debate, some of it relevant and  some of it not.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        But clearly then, if you went back through your files  and you found that those invitations had been issued, clearly tobacco  companies had been on your general invitation mailing list at some point,  which still doesn't make the situation any better for you, given your stance  now on tobacco donations does it?

NICOLA ROXON:   I don't really agree with that. There's no suggestion that I  am in any way under the influence of big tobacco companies. They would be  feeling, if they spent any money on me that it was a very poor investment. But  it was part of the Labor Party, as it still is for the Liberal Party - a process

where we did, in the past, before 2004, invite them to events. It was part of  our rules that we were able to take donations. I don't believe that I did that  very often, but I have publicly declared, for example, attending the tennis.



I mean these - in 1999 - these things do not affect where our party and our  Government is now at. Since 2004 we have not taken donations. In contrast,  the Liberal Party has received millions of dollars in that time.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Yes, but this was after the then leader Mark Latham  banned tobacco donations, as you say...

NICOLA ROXON:   Well that's - well that's why...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        ...and the...

NICOLA ROXON:   ...the invitation...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        ...a year later.

NICOLA ROXON:   ...went out. That's why the invitations being sent were  absolutely an error and I've been very public...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Yes, but I - but I...

NICOLA ROXON:   ...about that.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        ...but I do want to ask, nonetheless, that those invitees  were still there in some way on that general invitation list and the letters went  out. In your mind then, in 2005, was there a difference between a direct  political donation and attendance at a fundraising dinner, was there a  distinction?

NICOLA ROXON:   No, no, there wasn't. It was absolutely a mistake. If they  had attended and donated that would have been a breech and they shouldn't  have been sent. And obviously that's embarrassing for me. I mean obviously  you don't want to make these sorts of mistakes. In politics you spend - and I  certainly spend - a lot of time being very careful about the way I conduct  myself and the way that we prosecute our policies. So, of course, this is  embarrassing, but it does need to kept in perspective. Six years ago an  invitation was sent, that was not accepted. A donation was not made. And in  that time the Liberal Party have continued to receive millions of dollars of  donations. And they're the ones who are wavering on whether they'd support  us for plain packaging.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        How do you plan then to live down the claims of  hypocrisy that are being made against you now?

NICOLA ROXON:   Well I think claims can always be made. Ultimately the  fight that we're in at the moment is not about me. The fight is about whether or  not we should take all steps to reduce the number of people who take up  smoking as a habit. That's what we're doing with plain packaging and I only  heard a part of your earlier interview, but clearly there are going to be some  very big interests that oppose it.



Nevertheless, we think that this groundbreaking step is one that will mean that  we will have lower smoking rates in Australia. And if we can do anything to  reduce the 15,000 people that die every year from tobacco related illnesses,

well it will be worth it. And people can call me what they like, but I reckon that  would be a pretty good idea if that works.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        We'll get to the substance of that next, but just one  last question on this issue. Do you concede though, to some extent, given the  atmospherics around this and the impression created, and as you can  concede yourself, it is embarrassing. This then...

NICOLA ROXON:   Oh, absolutely.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        ...this then blights your attack on Tony Abbott's call to -  for him to kick the habit.

NICOLA ROXON:   No, I don't think it blunts any of the attack. Of course, it's  embarrassing, of course in politics people never want to make mistakes. But  my philosophy has always been if you make them, you own up to them and  you keep focused on what it is that you're trying to achieve. And what we're  trying to achieve here is a world first. We think it will assist in reducing the  number of people that smoke and, therefore, reducing the harm that's caused  - reducing the burden on the health system. That's ultimately what this is all  about and there will be a lot of distractions and fights around.

I still believe that it's very difficult for Mr Abbott, when millions of dollars have  been received and when he's been wavering on whether he will support this  approach. I think it is difficult for them that they still receive donations. And  last night Julie Bishop said on television look, this is nothing to do with Mr  Abbott, he has no control over this. So I mean they run around saying he can  stop the boats and stop the taxes, but they can't stop the donations. This is  not consistent.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        All right. Well, look, let's get to the substance of what  the - that interesting Coalition of American Business Groups and  Manufacturers had to say about the proposed plain packaging legislation that  you're considering at the moment. It includes groups such as the US Chamber  of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the United States  Council for [indistinct] Business and others. And they're basically saying that  Australia will be in violation of its commitments given to international trading  partners, in addition to the criticism that in their view there's no scientific  evidence that this plain paper packaging would even work anyway.



First of all, are there any fears in the government that the government is in  breech of its international trade obligations and commitments?

NICOLA ROXON:   No, there isn't. We, of course, take legal advice on the  actions and decisions that we make. We're very confident that we're on solid  ground. And the reason that we're so confident of this is that governments are  always able to take actions to act in the public interest, or in public health, or  public protection. Now there's always been fights about how far that should  go, but it's very clear in international treaties and others, that governments are  able to make laws to protect the health of their communities.

The World Health Organisation recommends that states consider taking this  plain packaging measure. That was inserted into the Tobacco Control  Convention in 2004, or 2005.

So, you know, this is a step where we believe we've got very strong grounds.  And ultimately, I think most Australians believe that the Australian  Government should be able to make laws for the Australian people.  Ultimately, international organisations can have views, but we have to be the  masters of our own destiny.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Well, indeed, but this is not just about an international  view. They're calling Australia very clearly to account in terms of your  international relations that you have - the commitments that have been given,  under international trade agreements. And they're specific. They say the WTO  agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights - and that's  really been the sticking point with this one - states very clearly trademarks  can't be required to be used in a special form, as they would be with plain  packaging.

The Australian Government would be dictating to these companies how their  trademarks can be used and you can't do that.

NICOLA ROXON:   Well I disagree with that. We've been able to restrict the  way tobacco companies promote their products in Australia for many decades  - governments of both colours. People haven't argued that that, you know, is a  restriction, or they haven't successfully argued that's a restriction of their  intellectual property rights.

Look, I mean, ultimately this could be a wonderful festival for lawyers and  people could argue the toss in both directions. That's not my job. My job is to  make sure...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        It could turn out to be that way though couldn't it? This  could be a long...

NICOLA ROXON:   Well - well my...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        ...lawyer's picnic.

NICOLA ROXON:   Well my job is to make sure that we get proper advice;  that we act according to that advice. That we make sure that if we're going to  take world first action that we are on strong ground. We're comfortable that we  are. And ultimately, I don't think that any other businesses need to buy into  this argument. Tobacco is a very unusual product. It's the only legal product in  the world where there is so much known about the harm it causes and there is  no safe amount of product that can be consumed.

So this sort of scaremongering, that it's going to lead to chocolate being sold  in plain packaging is really just part of a campaign to try to blur the lines.  When it comes to tobacco, there's a very clear message - there isn't a safe  amount and our government will do all we can to reduce consumption of

tobacco and to make sure there is a smaller possible number of people who  are getting hooked into this new addictive and dangerous product.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Nicola Roxon, just a final question on a separate  subject.  We're starting to hear now from disquieted government members on  the issue of asylum seekers, where they might be sent to - the places that are  very much disturbing some Labor backbenchers about where asylum seekers  might end up - just as we did from Coalition members during John Howard's  government.

Is this an issue on which you might find your voice of objection in the end?

NICOLA ROXON:   Well ultimately our party, of course, whether it's through  Cabinet, or through the Caucus, is able to argue through a whole lot of  issues.  I'm very comfortable that my role is to have views and express them

within the Cabinet.

I think what the government is trying to do with our deal with Malaysia, is  actually really innovative and has the potential to provide enormous benefit,  not just to the extra people who will be able to come and settle in Australia,  but also to make sure that people smuggling, which is inherently so  dangerous for people, does actually have that business case broken.  Of  course, the aim that you've heard the Prime Minister talk about very often...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Sure, but just - but just...

NICOLA ROXON:   ....so I'm comfortable...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        ...but just to jump in there and we hear that you're  comfortable with that and you've made that point on this program before.  Still,  as Health Minister, you don't have any qualms about the state of mental  health that you might be engendering in some of these people, in the places  that you could be ending up sending them to?  You have no qualms there?

NICOLA ROXON:   Well I think that it is more accurate to say that as a  government we properly discuss all of those issues within the Cabinet or  within the Caucus.  That's the place to do that.  I'm not the minister  responsible for this when the negotiations are still underway with Malaysia.   But...

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        [Indistinct] Opposition members who are very happy to  hear from dissenting Coalition members at the time when they, according to  some, very bravely found their voice and spoke out about a policy that they  couldn't agree with.  The then Labor Opposition was pointing to those people  saying; ah ha, you see; brave people.  I mean you don't think that's actually

the position of government members who disagree to do that publicly too?

NICOLA ROXON:   Well I think that, you know, we're a party where people  express their views strongly in lots of different forums.  But you're asking me  for my view and my view is that Minister Bowen is very careful in negotiating  with the Malaysian Government, to ensure that appropriate protections are

going to be in place.  I am very confident that he's doing that job well and  ultimately that is what our government needs to do.

It's a serious issue.  It needs to be done carefully.  And I'm confident that he's  doing that.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Nicola Roxon, good to talk to you.  Thanks for making  time available.

NICOLA ROXON:   Thank you.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:        Thank you.

Ends.
