ANDREW O’KEEFE:

Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott joins us from Melbourne. Thank you Mr Abbott for joining us this  Saturday morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Nice to be with you Andrew.

ANDREW O’KEEFE:

Are there parts of this budget that you support?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ll carefully consider the measures that the Government announced yesterday but the fact is there  are three new taxes and if the Government hits you with new taxes before an election, just think what they’re  going to do to you after an election. We’ve got unemployment soaring towards 800,000. We’ve got the debt  soaring towards $400 billion. Unfortunately Andrew, it’s just going to get worse under Labor because Labor  has no plan to grow the economy. If you want to grow the economy you’ve got to get taxes down, you’ve  got to get regulation down, that will get productivity up and that gets economic growth up.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE:

Mr Abbott were you surprised, like I guess the rest of the country yesterday, when you heard about this $30  billion black hole? Did you think it would be that big?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sam, look, it was a shock at one level because the budgetary position has been deteriorating by $3 billion  every single week just since the budget was brought down in May, but this is a Government which

consistently gets its figures wrong. It hasn’t got any of its forecasts right. Every time they tell us the deficit  is going to be a particular figure, it turns out to be much, much worse and I think this is something to bear in  mind as we roll into an election; you can’t believe this Government’s figures.

ANDREW O’KEEFE:

Mr Abbott the economists are saying that really this blowout is to be pinpointed at three things; number one,  there has been significant downgrade in forecast tax collections; number two, there’s been a bigger than  expected drop in export prices; and number three, there is generally a weaker global economic outlook, but  particularly in China. Now, of those three major factors contributing to this, how can government policy  really affect positively the outlook for Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Andrew, this Government is always making excuses for its own poor performance and sure the  situation overseas leaves a bit to be desired, but that means it’s more important than ever that we get our  house in order here in Australia and that means reducing unnecessary government expenditure, it means  getting taxes down so that the economy can grow; and there was no plan for growth in what the Treasurer  had to say yesterday and that was the big problem. Sure, there were all these additional taxes: the company  car tax, the cigarette tax, the savings tax, but where was the plan for growth? And that’s the problem with  this Government, they don’t have one.

ANDREW O’KEEFE:

You talk about reducing unnecessary expenditure. Now, a couple of weeks ago on the show you told us that  you would keep the carbon tax compensation whilst scrapping the carbon tax. We’re also reading that you  will match Labor’s school funding pledges, dollar for dollar, I quote, without forcing the states to contribute  anything or asking them to cede any control. How is that reducing unnecessary spending?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because we’re not going to continue the school kids bonus which is a cash splash with borrowed money,  we’re not going to continue to grow the public service the way this Government is, we are going to delay the  superannuation guarantee levy; all of these things mean that we’ve already identified some $15 billion in  savings over the forward estimates. Andrew, look at the record of the Coalition in government; in  government we turned a $10 billion budget black hole into consistent one per cent of GDP surpluses, we  turned $96 billion of net commonwealth debt into $70 billion of net commonwealth assets - we’ve done it  before, we can do it again because surpluses and savings are in the Coalition’s DNA.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE:

Mr Abbott I want to ask you about this new levy on bank accounts, which of course customers will end up  paying for. What do you make of that and would the Opposition rule out introducing a similar tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Sam, the GFC, when the banks were under a bit of pressure is five years ago now. So this isn’t to  protect bank deposits, this is just a revenue grab; just like the cigarette tax isn’t about health, it’s just a  revenue grab. This Government will dress things up as one thing but they’re not and I think the public are  sick of being played for mugs by the current Government.

ANDREW O’KEEFE:

With something like the cigarette tax, I mean yes, I think most people would agree with you that whilst it’s  being sold as a health measure it’s in fact a revenue measure, but if the outcome is the same, does it matter?

TONY ABBOTT:

Andrew, they only raise the $5 billion in revenue because people keep smoking. So it’s not about preventing  people from smoking, it is just about hitting smokers where it hurts in the hip pocket to help the Government  and this is what always happens under this mob Andrew; they’ve got a problem, they make the public pay.  We’ve got a problem because this is a Government which is addicted to spending and if you’re addicted to  spending you’re addicted to taxing.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE:

Ok. Look, there are reports in all of the papers today that Kevin Rudd will call an election or announce an  election probably tomorrow, maybe Monday for September 7. What are you hearing?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sam, there are all these rumours around, in the end Kevin Rudd will do what Kevin Rudd wants, that’s what  he always does; but plainly much of what he’s done in the few weeks since he became Prime Minister is  already unravelling. He told us a fortnight ago, for instance, that every illegal arrival by boat was going to  PNG, he snuck into the statement yesterday that they’re actually building a new detention centre at  Singleton. How can he tell us that everyone’s going to go to PNG when yesterday he admits that they’ve got  to have a new detention centre at Singleton? Plainly he wasn’t being honest with us a couple of weeks ago.

ANDREW O’KEEFE:

Well it seems everyone is making this policy up on the go. I mean, the Coalition saying that they’re going to  open up 5,000 new beds on Nauru, and yet we’re stopping the boats, so why do we need the beds?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what we’ve said is that we aren’t going to be intimidated by the people smugglers. Our will is greater  than theirs. We will send all arrivals offshore for processing but unlike Labor, there’ll be temporary  protection visas for anyone who does get to Australia and we are prepared to turn boats around where it’s  safe to do so, Andrew, and we’ve had the same policy for four years.  We’ve had the same clear plans;  we’ve had the same strong team for four years. Labor don’t believe the same thing from one week to the  other.

SAMANTHA ARMYTAGE:

Ok, look, Mr Abbott we have to leave it there, but thank you for your time this morning and I’m sure we  will chat to you again very soon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sam and Andrew, look, it’s terrific to be with you and thank you for having me on the programme.
