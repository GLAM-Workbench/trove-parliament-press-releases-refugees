Asylum seekers’

legal rights must be protected

Â

The arrival by ship of fifty-two foreign nationals on Christmas eve 
in the Northern Territory,  could be a test of the Government’s 
commitment to the legal rights of asylum seekers, said Senator Andrew 
Bartlett, Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration.

Â

Senator Bartlett said, “If these people are seeking 
asylum they already have three strikes against them — they are doing 
it on-shore, in a remote location where it will be more difficult to 
get adequate ongoing legal assistance, and to a Government seemingly 
determined to be tough on migrants and asylum seekers.

Â

“Minister Ruddock must guarantee that if these people 
are seeking asylum in Australia that they can access adequate legal 
advice to assist them through the highly complex and bureaucratic immigration 
process.

Â

“The fact that these people may make on-shore application 
for refugee status must not disadvantage them in comparison to off-shore 
applicants, who the Immigration Minister appears to favour.

Â

“A lack of access to adequate legal facilities can 
delay or lengthen legal proceedings, which is not in anyone’s interests.”

Â

The fifty-two foreign nationals have been transferred 
to the Port Hedland detention centre.

Â

“While Port Hedland may have better facilities for 
housing illegal immigrants, Amnesty and refugee lawyers have pointed 
out that asylum seekers in remote locations can be disadvantaged by 
a lack of access to adequate legal facilities,” said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“The Government should not attempt to keep asylum-seekers 
out of sight, out of mind.

Â

“Recently the Government has made a point of criticising 
the judiciary about immigration decisions and has taken steps to restrict 
access to legal advice and judicial review for would-be immigrant applicants 
and asylum seekers.

Â

“Since July 1998, asylum seekers appealing immigration 
decisions as refugees are not allowed to work or to access Medicare. 
The Government is basically trying to starve would-be refugees out of 
the country while a proper legal appeal is under way.

Â

“The Government says it is ‘streamlining’, the 
Democrats say they are curtailing proper legal processes,” concluded 
Senator Bartlett.
