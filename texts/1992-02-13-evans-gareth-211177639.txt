DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND

Mr John McCarthy has been appointed Ambassador to Thailand,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth  Evans, announced today.

Senator Evans said Australia had a wide-ranging and growing  relationship with Thailand involving extensive cooperation on  bilateral and multilateral issues.  Senator Evans said the increasing links between Australia and  Thailand reflected geographic proximity, mutual economic  interests, shared strategic perspectives and increasing social  contacts.

He said the commercial relationship between Australia and  Thailand had become increasingly important to both countries.

He said Thailand had achieved one of the highest economic

growth rates in the world in recent years and this presented  Australia with great commercial opportunities.

"Strategically located in the vibrant Pacific Rim, Thailand's  growth has been founded on a traditionally strong agricultural  sector coupled with a rapidly expanding manufacturing and  services sector.

"Mr McCarthy will seek to continue the expansion in the

Australia-Thailand relationship, building particularly on the  economic and trade potential."

Mr McCarthy is a senior and highly experienced diplomat who  joined the then Department of External Affairs in 1968 and

served in Vientiane, Washington (twice) and Damascus and has  been Ambassador to Vietnam and Mexico. He was Principal

Private Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr

Peacock, between 1978-80 and is currently head of the

International Organisation and Legal Division with the

Department in Canberra. He was educated at Cambridge and

holds a Master of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Law degree.

He is expected to take up his appointment in April.
