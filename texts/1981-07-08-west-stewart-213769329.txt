- U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission

- Enviromental Protection Authority

Talks concentrated on U.S. Federal role in

- Clean Air Legislation

- Assesment of Enviromental effects new industrial projects

- Nuclear Regulation and future Nuclear Power

"I have been informed that the U.S. Nuclear Power Industry is in rapid decline ‘   due to three factors,"

- .nscaluting construction cost of now stations

- Possibility of Nuclear accidents and necessity fur massive  regulation and Surveillance by governments.

- Problems of high levels of Nuclear waste disposals

"I am informed despite President Reagans' desire to stimulate the industry, no  U.S.  state is willing to allow deep geological disposal of nuclear waste." The Department of Energy is pessimistic about successful permanent disposal before  1995-2000, A.D."

Also, Capital costs are rocketing. In the state of Washington, the cost of providing  6000 megawatts of new nuclear power has increased to $20 Billion U.S. due mainly  to interest rates of 12-15% and construction time 12 years.

"N.R.C. has developed a comprehensive plan of requiring immediate notification of  at least 17 types of possible nuclear accidents. The plant at Three Mile Island  still faces a $2 billion clean up that up one is willing to pay for. '  Ã¢ÂÂ

I am informed by the N.R.C. that no one knows how to decontaminate the ruined reactor.

I am convinced the U.S. is set to rely on providing increased power from coal and  natural gas, not from Nuclear Reactors. :  :  "
