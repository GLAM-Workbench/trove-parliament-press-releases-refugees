Federal Police Should be Called In - Greens to Take Action



The Australian Federal Police must investigate claims that officials were involved  in the use of false passports to have asylum-seekers removed from Australia to  Syria, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.



"The Passport Act carries penalties of 2 to 7 years for making, using or accepting  false passports," Senator Brown said.

"These are serious crimes.  Immigration Minister Ruddock and Attorney-General  Williams should mount an immediate police investigation.

"While the Government is talking tough about new Australian passport security  measures they can not let these allegations go unchecked.

"The fact that Mr Ruddock's office is indicting that no action is going to be taken  is astounding. I will now ask the Federal Police to investigate the allegations.

"These allegations add fuel to the Greens' ongoing call for an independent  judicial inquiry into immigration and detention centres," Senator Brown said.
