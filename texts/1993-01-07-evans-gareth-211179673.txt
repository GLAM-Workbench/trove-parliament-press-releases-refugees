Australian assistance for Irian Jaya border crossers in PNG

Australia will provide $300,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) program for Irian Jaya border-crossers in Papua New Guinea,  the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, J9hn Kerin, announced today.

"At present there are 3,500 refugees from Irian Jaya receiving assistance from  UNHCR in Papua New Guinea," Mr Kerin said.

''During the corning year about 2,000 refugees will be relocated from border areas  to a settlement at East A win.

Since 1984-85 Australia has been the major donor to this UNHCR program  providing a total of $7.7 million. In the past Australia has provided about half of  the program's annual budget. Through the program, the UNHCR has assisted  the refugees with food, transport, household needs, education, agriculture and  livestock, and income generation projects.

"Australia welcomes the move by the Government of Papua New Guinea to  assume greater financial responsibility for the refugees. Ã¢Â‘

"The PNG commitment will now enable the UNHCR to wind down its  operations by June.

With the winding down of UNHCR operations Australia has been enabled to  reduce its financial commitment to the program.

Australian assistance for the UNHCR border crossers program is provided  through AIDAB, Australia's overseas aid agency.
