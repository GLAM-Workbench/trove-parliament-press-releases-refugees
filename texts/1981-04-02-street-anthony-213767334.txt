FOOD AID FOR AFGHAN REFUGEES

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Tony Street MP,  announced today that the Australian Government was providing  additional food aid worth $6,2 million to alleviate the plight of  the Afghan refugees in Pakistan and to ease the burden on Pakistan

of providing temporary asylum to 1.6 million displaced people  from Afghanistan.

The Minister said that the additional allocation was  prompted by the rapid increase in refugees,  notably an inflow of  143,000 in January 1981.

Both the Pakistan Government and the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have appealed to donors to provide  more aid quickly.

Mr Street expressed concern at reports that the number  of refugees could grow to two million by mid-1981, and may even  reach three million. He said the main problem would continue to be  finding sufficient food to feed this large number of people.

To relieve hardship and suffering amongst the most  vulnerable groups, Australia would provide UNHCR with an immediate _  shipment of 100 tonnes of skim milk powder valued at $120,000. In addition, Australia would provide 7,500 tonnes of wheat,  worth  $1.6 million, including freight, to UNHCR for distribution to the

Afghanistan refugees, and 25,000 tonnes of wheat to Pakistan worth  $4.4 million.

The Minister added that this total of 32,500 tonnes of  wheat would be available to UNHCR and Pakistan for shipment in July.  The Government would review the situation in mid-1981 to determine  whether to make further allocations of food grain, non-grain food

or other humanitarian assistance.

Part of"Australia1s 1980-81 pledge to the World Food  Program Ã¢ÂÂ¢will be used, to purchase 800 tonnes of Australian sugar , Â·   valued at $500,000 for projeqt.s in Pakistan, including relief  for refugeesÃ¢ÂÂ '

The Government's contributions to the Afghan refugee  situation now totalled about $7 million. Currently,  about 100 tonnes  of high-protein biscuits supplied by Australia were being distributed  to supplement feeding programs in the refugee- camps.

The Minister said: "By these prompt donations, Australia is seeking to show practical compassion for the welfare of those  innocent people who have been forced to flee from invading and  occupying foreign forces".
