Citizenship for 20 Refugees

19 June 2005

Nearly 20 refugees will celebrate World Refugee Day by becoming Australian citizens at a special ceremony at Hobart  Town Hall on 20 June.

The Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said the conferees were  refugees who have built new lives in Australia.

‘Our newest citizens have come from Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and Rwanda. I am delighted they are taking the final step in  becoming full participants in the Australian community,’ Minister McGauran said.

‘The theme for World Refugee Day 2005 is Courage and this citizenship ceremony is a celebration of the spirit, courage  and determination that characterises humanitarian entrants.

‘The ceremony will be followed by cultural entertainment and a short film called ‘Courage’, based on the lives and  experiences of refugees.

‘Australia has one of the largest dedicated refugee and humanitarian resettlement programs in the world. In the past year  Tasmania has welcomed 349 arrivals under the Refugee and Special Humanitarian programs,’ Minister McGauran said.

‘Citizenship is the unifying force in our culturally diverse society. I encourage all those who are eligible to apply for  Australian citizenship.’

Citizenship information is available at www.citizenship.gov.au or from the Citizenship Information Line on 131 880.
