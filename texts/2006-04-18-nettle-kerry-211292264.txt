Australian officials should ensure West Papuan mother's safety



Senator Nettle, 18th April 2006

Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the federal government  to ensure that Australian officials in Papuan New Guinea work with local  authorities and the UNHCR to ensure the safety of Siti Pandera Wanggai,  mother of 4 year old West Papuan refugee Anike Wanggai.

"Australian officials should do all they can to ensure the safety of Siti Wanggai,"  said Senator Nettle

"The Greens are greatly concerned that this family has been caught up and  exploited in the row between Australia and Indonesia over West Papua.

"I call on the government to do all it can to ensure Ms Wanggai safety and  facilitate her being reunited with her four year old daughter in Australia.

"Clearly she has come under pressure from the Indonesian military and now  needs protection. The best result would for her to be reunited with her child in  Australia.

"Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: "The family is  the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by  society and the State."
