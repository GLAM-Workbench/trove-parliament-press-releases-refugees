We are in the second half of 1979. Statistics show that Australia .  i

since 1975, has accepted 30,000 refugees from Indo-China of which

approximately 2,400 are the so-called "boat people". Mr McKellar

has just returned from an international Conference in Geneva where

he pledged that Australia will increase "its quota of refugees to

reach 14,000 people per year". However, Mr McKellar* s statement in

Geneva did not in fact constitute neither a ypolicy nor a new approach,   but merely administrative changes in the handling of refugees.

A Ministerial Statement to Parliament on 14 May 1977 outlined the   Liberal philosophy. The statement outlined four "principles" and   proposed six new "mechanisms” whereby the Government should be able   to respond more quickly to refugee problems. Mr McKellar outlined

six "problems" which the Government recognises in relation to refugees.   These in fact constitute a reassertion of existing immigration criteria,   especially in so far as they placed emphasis on reuniting families,   and accepting those refugees with skills appropriate to Australian

needs.. He also made clear that while many refugees would not choose to   come to Australia nor easily settle he re , such people might be accepted   on purely "humanitarian grounds"-Â·as in the case of handicapped people.

Combine this philosophy with Mr McKellar * s recent statement that   "we are not part of Asia, ... we are a European settlement" and one can   have a clearer picture of the attitude of the Liberal Government in

finding a just solution to the South-East Asian refugee problem.

It needs to be emphasised that it is from a history of political and   economic turmoil and warfare that today's refugees emerge. The movements   of people in Indo-China is not a new phenomena. What is new is that   the movement is now away from Indo-China and poses problems for surroundÂ­

ing countries in South-East Asia, as well as for the West. These   refugees are victims of not only the present situation but of a grim   history of warfare through which they have all lived.

In June 19.79 there were 3 80,0.00 Indo-Chinese refugees in South-East

Asia with, a strong indication that this figure could reach as high as

one and a half million. The number of refugees waiting resettlement in

each country are: Ã¢ÂÂ  !  ‘  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   "

Indonesia:

210,000 in 15 camps

77.000 in 3 camps

53.000 in a number of temporary camps

31,200 in 2 camps.

These figures are subject to rapid change and there were nearly 70,000

new arrivals in June. It has been estimated that there are nearly

one million ethnic Chinese still living in Vietnam and another half

a million of potential Vietnamese nationals wishing to leave their

country.

The reasons for this mass migration are complex, ranging from racial

tensions to political persecution, but there are two predominant

contributing factors:

1. Shortage of food in Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos, and

2. The instability caused by war.

Thailand, the country sheltering largest number of refugees,is under

a four-fold problem; in the north from Laos, in the east from Kampuchea,

in the south from the boat people and within its own borders the presence

of huge numbers of displaced persons ÃÂ ÃÂ· ÃÂ²generating strong local conÂ­

flicts. Market prices are rising in local areas in a country where

the average yearly per-capita income (in certain provinces) is $US195.

On the 8th June 1979, Thai patience ran out.  After inviting third

countries to increase their intake of refugees the army started, to push

40,000 refugees back across its borders.  And it is now history that

other countries of first asylum have intimated that they will follow

suit unless something immediate and drastic is done in the international r . Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ

arena about an international problem.

THE BOAT PEOPLE *  1  2

These people are the product of a number of internal problems in

Vietnam and it is these refugees with their shipwrecks, that have

attracted the world's attention. At the end of the war in 1975, Vietnam

was devastated. Over half the population was left homeless, nearly

201 of the population killed, communications destroyed, cities and

industries destroyed by bombings. Economic difficulties were further

agravated; by two major natural disasters - first a drought andÂ·then a

flood which destroyed the bulk of the rice crop, and there has been

a serious shortage of foreign exchange due to widespread hoarding of

gold and the refusal of Western countries - especially the USA to

provide aid. Â·

’  ; .

In an attempt to remedy food shortages, urban people were transferred

to "ne,w economic zones", a move which was strongly resisted by the

qualified tradesmen, technicians and professionals. In 1978 "private

commerce" and.private businesses were halted and this marked the

beginning of a large scale ethnic Chinese migration. Basically there

are three groups of people leaving Vietnam: .

1. Ethnic Chinese: who are "assisted" out of Vietnam by the

authorities paying an average of $US 2,500 in gold for each

member of the family. They usually leave Vietnam in.ships or large

b oa t s.

2. Political Refugees: There are approximately 250,000 Vietnamese .

who worked for the previous regime in South Vietnam. These people

h^ive usually been sent to "re-education camps" and have proved

to be incooperative with the new regime. They are also allowed

to leave after payments of gold.

3. The "Boat People": Many Vietnamese are leaving in small boats

lured by Western images of richness and wealth. They include

single men who risk being shot if caught leaving the country

while obviously they do not pay the authorities ,  it costs a lot

to arrange a passage out of Vietnam.

After the retreat of the USA from South Vietnam and the north Vietnamese

taking control of the South, many people have converted their money

into gold. This has had a serious effect in internal liquidity and

foreign exchange. It has repeatedly been suggested that the Vietnamese

Government, under economic pressure, is using the "false migration" to

extract this wealth from citizens who are most likely to have accumÂ­

ulated gold.

WHAT 'IS THE SOLUTION?

Current responses in Geneva by the wealthy Western countries, including

Australia, were seen by the Governments of South-East Asia as cosmetic

attempts to avoid responsibility for the welfare of refugees. There

are two issues that require immediate attention:

1. There is a civil and economic dislocation caused by the influx of

refugees into Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia. These

countries are unlikely to be influenced by any solution other than

o.ffers of economic aid and a precise commitment to resettle large

numbers of refugees.  Plans by Western countries without correspondÂ­

ing economic offers or commitments for resettlement,  are seen by

these countries of first asylum as tokenistic and unrealistic, in

as much as the latter disregard the domestic problems of the former.

2. Economic and industrial hardship as well as famine in Vietnam,

Kampuchea and Laos are a prime cause for the departure of many people

There is an immediate need in these countries for food and econoniip

aid which would allow them to rebuild and restructure their war

shattered economies.

Australia can and must play an important role in finding a solution to

the refugee problem. There ;are a number of options available and we

must bear in mind that although our continent and our country is called

Australia, our neighbours, partners and our trading resources lie in

Asia and with the Asian countries.

It is our role to point out that the refugee problem is an international

problem and not only "adversity" facing some "unfortunate" selected

countries. Countries of first asylum cannot be expected to continue

to carry the full burden of the settlement of refugees together with a

selected few of the '  Western countries. .  Ã¢ÂÂ

Unfortunately, the present Liberal Government does not have a clear

policy aimed at finding solutions in an international context. Perhaps

it is worth noting that the Liberals withdrew aid from Vietnam after

the invasion of Kampuchea in an attempt to bring diplomatic and economic

pressure to bear on Vietnam. The withdrawal of aid and indeed the.  . 1 ye Wc/te/ice*  earlier^to grant it, is a contributing factor in the exodus of people

from Vietnam. ’
