The Hon Richard Marles MP   Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs



ABC 774 Melbourne — Interview with Jon Faine  Transcript, E&OE

17 October 2011

JON FAINE: Well, after last Friday's debacle in the national capital with the Labor Party, on  the one hand, claiming a huge victory on its carbon tax legislation, then kicking an own goal  and finishing the week on a low by abandoning the Malaysia solution, stories emerged over  the weekend of instability and argy-bargy behind the scenes in the federal Labor Party.

Well, the shutters have come down in many quarters this morning, but Richard Marles,  Parliamentary Secretary in the Gillard Government and member for one of the Geelong seats  for the Labor Party, is prepared to speak this morning about Labor faction fighting.

Richard Marles, good morning to you.

RICHARD MARLES: Good morning, Jon; how are you?

JON FAINE: Well, I'm well, but how are things within the right wing faction of the Labor  Party? Are you all now at each other's throats?

RICHARD MARLES: No, of course we're not, Jon, and I think things are fine within the  Labor Party.

Look, we did have a great week last week in seeing the carbon price go through the  Parliament. This has been a big issue that this country has had to face and I think the Prime  Minister has shown tremendous leadership in dealing with the issue and getting it through the  House of Representatives is a huge moment. It's a huge moment for this government, but it's  a huge moment for the country.

JON FAINE: So, why the extraordinary own goal, the absurd almost contrast between, on  the one hand, that, and then the failed strategy on the Malaysia solution to chalk up one of the  biggest — if not the biggest — success of her prime ministership, and then immediately  undermine yourself on asylum seekers.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, firstly, the government hasn't abandoned the Malaysian  arrangement. What we've seen is an Opposition which has done an enormous backflip and an  act of rank hypocrisy.

Having supported offshore processing for a decade it is now so hell-bent on wrecking  government policy that it doesn't mind if it wrecks its own policy along the way…

JON FAINE: Yeah, okay, so they set a trap…

RICHARD MARLES: Just using its numbers to — well, didn't set a trap, but using its own  numbers to stop…

JON FAINE: They set a trap and the Labor Party walked into it.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, they didn't set a trap. What they've done is completely trashed  their own views about how to deal with asylum seekers and are preventing the government  from walking down the path of pursuing the Malaysian arrangement.

Now, that's what we think should still be done. We haven't shelved that and we'll keep the  pressure on the Opposition to try and put that in place. But so long as the Opposition are  taking the stance they're taking, it means that this legislation won't get through the House of  Representatives. So, we're working on onshore processing and, obviously, we'll do what we

can to make that work.

JON FAINE: But Mr Marles, surely, the distinction here is that governments are there to  govern and to lead, oppositions oppose. Now, what's happened here is you're saying that the  government's failure has exposed the Opposition. But that's not what it's about. It's about the  government delivering solutions to problems that confront the nation and here, self-evidently,  they've not done so.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, we all know what the numbers are in the House of  Representatives. This is a finely-balanced Parliament and we are a minority government.  There's no news in that.

And I think what the Australian people expect of their politicians is that they act with  consistency and that they approach these issues on the basis of what their well-held beliefs  are, what the beliefs of the Opposition have been for a decade. And to see them trash that in  an act of rank hypocrisy, so that they will do whatever they can to wreck government policy,  even if it means wrecking their own, is something that the Australian people are going to  condemn.

And now we've got this situation where offshore processing, be it Malaysia or even if in a  day the Opposition were in government, the Nauru arrangement are now not possible….

JON FAINE: All right.

RICHARD MARLES: … by virtue of what's happened in the High Court.

JON FAINE: Is it true that the factional leaders, Bill Shorten, Stephen Conroy and Mark  Arbib, who were instrumental in knocking off Kevin Rudd, went and had a meeting with  Julia Gillard late last week?

RICHARD MARLES: Oh well, I'm unaware of that and that's a question that you would  need to…

JON FAINE: I don't believe that.

RICHARD MARLES: … put to them.

JON FAINE: I don't believe you're unaware of it. You'd know if it had happened.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I'm telling you I am unaware of it, and it's a question that you  would need to put to them.

JON FAINE: I've tried this morning, they're not returning calls.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, all…

JON FAINE: Bill Shorten, we're told, is on a plane, Stephen Conroy's not replied and Mark  Arbib I've not heard from either.

RICHARD MARLES: Right. Well, I'm sure they are on planes but in my conversations  with them, I know that they support Julia Gillard. And Julia Gillard is going to lead the  government in the next election.

She has done an amazing job in what are very, very difficult circumstances. And you can see  that in terms of the carbon price legislation. I mean, this country needs to put a price on  carbon. It was a difficult debate from day one — you know that Jon — and you know all the  centimetres of news copy and the hours that have been debated on radio around this issue.  But she's pursued it with vigour and, as a result, we've now got a bill through the Parliament,  and this country is going to address something which it's always needed to do.

JON FAINE: Okay, but then…

RICHARD MARLES: That's a real sign of leadership.

JON FAINE: You didn't deal with the specific question on the timing and strategy. Who is  the genius who thought it was good to undermine that success the next day with the Malaysia  solution?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, that's a function of what was a scheduling within the  Parliament. That debate was coming up on the Thursday. It had been listed to be…

JON FAINE: So why not defer it?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, it had been listed in the Parliament for a long period of time.  Any alteration to the scheduling of that debate was going to end up being news and that's

what occurred on Thursday. Indeed, you know, it was deferred for a bit of time on Thursday  and that, in turn, ended up in the news.

So, these are difficult things. This is a difficult issue in terms of asylum seeker debate and  you know that.

JON FAINE: Yeah, running the country is a difficult job. I think we all know that.

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, but it's made more difficult when people come to the  Parliament with what have been consistent views over the course of a decade, and then they  absolutely trashed them in acts of rank hypocrisy, and that's what we've seen on the part of  the Opposition.

When the Australian people put in place a minority government and a finely-tuned  Parliament, they expected that people would take to the Parliament the beliefs that they have  held over the course of a decade. They would expect that people would at least pursue their  own policies…

JON FAINE: Yeah.

RICHARD MARLES: … with vigour. But what we are now seeing with the Opposition is  that they are prepared to trash their own policies in an effort to wreck the government…

JON FAINE: All right.

RICHARD MARLES: … and that is not what the Australian people voted for.

JON FAINE: All right. And the latest opinion polls show that Kevin Rudd is still twice as  popular as Julia Gillard, but Stephen Smith, who some of your right-wing colleagues —  maybe even you — think as an alternative to Julia Gillard, is about as popular as she is,  which means he's also only half as popular as Kevin Rudd.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, just so that I can clarify the assertion that you put in the  question, I support Julia Gillard, the Caucus supports Julia Gillard and she is going to lead the  government to the next election. It's not about…

JON FAINE: Even with these figures. Even if she's doomed to fail?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, it's not about opinion polls, Jon. And, you know, if you were  going to focus on opinion polls, there's actually some good news in there. But I actually don't  think that's the relevant thing here, because what we're doing is difficult issues in the midst of  government.

I mention a carbon price. We knew that's not going to be a popular thing in the context of  opinion polls, but we also knew that the country needed a price on carbon to secure our  economy for the future. And so, that's why we've walked down that path. And I think, in the  long term, and these things are measured over the long term, the Australian people will mark  that very highly, as I think they will the way in which Julia Gillard is dealing with the  asylum-seeker policy.

And frankly, there is much more talk in the media amongst you and your colleagues in  relation to leadership than there is within the Labor Caucus.

JON FAINE: All right. Well, let's put that to the test of talk back as well.

I'm grateful to you for your time this morning and thank you.

RICHARD MARLES: It's a pleasure, Jon, thank you.

JON FAINE: Richard Marles, the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, which  means he's kind of like a junior minister in the Gillard Government.
