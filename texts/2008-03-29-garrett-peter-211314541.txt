GOVERNMENT TAKES EARTH HOUR LONG TERM

The Australian Government today announced new steps to deal with climate change and  sustainability, as more than 100 of its departments and agencies sign-up to switch-off for  Earth Hour 2008.

A whole of government taskforce will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  waste, energy and water use in Government operations, as well as the sustainable use of  Commonwealth land.

Known as the Inter-Departmental Committee on Government Leadership in Sustainability, it  will report to the Prime Minister in June, with an ongoing role in overseeing the  implementation of Government action on sustainability.

“The Australian Government is leading by example on climate change, not just by  participating in Earth Hour tonight, but also by finding long terms ways to reduce  emissions,” Senator Wong said.

“That Government action starts tonight, with thousands of lights in hundreds of government  offices across the nation will be extinguished for Earth Hour 2008,” Mr Garrett said.

The Department of Climate Change and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage  and the Arts are among 110 departments and agencies that have registered to participate in  Earth Hour. [The full list is attached.]

“The lights across more than 2220 buildings occupied by government departments and  agencies, with a floor area of 3,738,113m2, will be off for Earth Hour 2008,” Minister Garrett  said.

“This accounts for 97 per cent of Australian Government buildings across the nation that  have signed up and will be participating in the first global Earth Hour,” Senator Wong said.

The High Court of Australia, National Library of Australia, Australian War Memorial,  Parliament House, National Museum of Australia, National Science and Technology Centre  and Royal Australian Mint are among the iconic buildings in our nation’s capital that will be  switching off their lights.

The Maritime Museum of Australia in Sydney and Federal Courts of Australia around the  nation have also committed to Earth Hour.

“Even with a function scheduled on the night, the National Gallery of Australia has signed up  to switch off as many lights as possible, to conserve energy for the benefit of our environment,”  Mr Garrett said.

“The Australian Government is throwing its full support behind the efforts of WWF in  organising Earth Hour. It is vital that we raise awareness that we can all make a difference by  saving energy in our homes.”

The Interdepartmental Committee will examine a range of options to increase government  sustainability.

“It will consider all options including setting targets and powering Parliament House and  electorate offices with renewable and clean energy,” Senator Wong said.

“Importantly, we will investigate using the Government fleet to drive the market for low  emission cars, Senator Wong said.

“Minimum 5 star ratings for government office buildings and leases will be on the table, with  the most efficient and cost effective appliances used for Commonwealth operations,” Mr  Garrett said.

“In parallel with the Committee’s work, the Australian National Audit Office is undertaking  a performance audit across Government agencies to assess and report on the progress being  made in achieving better practice in green office procurement and sustainable office  management; completion anticipated in early 2009,” Minister Garrett said.

Senator Wong and Mr Garrett urged all Australians to participate in Earth Hour.

Participants should register online at www.earthhour.org then switch off all unnecessary  lights and unplug unnecessary appliances, from 8pm until 9pm.
