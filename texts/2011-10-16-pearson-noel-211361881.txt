TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MR NOEL PEARSON   AND MR ALAN TUDGE MHR, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR ASTON,  HOPEVALE, QUEENSLAND

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

NOEL PEARSON:

We are between 40 and 50 kilometres north of Hopevale and we’re on land here that was allocated in the  1980s to the family under legislation that Bob Katter had enacted in the Queensland parliament. The family  had been waiting since 1989 for the lease papers to arrive - that’s 25 years ago now they’ve been waiting,  but this is also their traditional country, this is the land of their grandmother. But the state legislation that  Katter passed promised to give them a perpetual lease over the country that they wanted to build a house on  and conduct tourism and other enterprise on. So, it’s been a history of great disappoint that they still don’t  have the title deeds in their hands.

Anyway, the family approached me a year ago and expressed their interest in working with the Bush Owner  Builder programme. I got contacted by an old saw miller from Victoria who had very sustainably managed a  timber operation down there and he was a grey nomad with his wife in Cape York and he offered to help the  families mill timber on their country and help them build their own homes. It’s an idea that I was very keen  about and Mark Carnegie, a philanthropist from Sydney, has put up a loan facility for the families to buy the  hardware and corrugated iron and other things but otherwise the whole project is based on the sweat equity  of the families.

So, I’m really pleased that Tony’s come to join the families up here, to continue the 10 year tradition we’ve  had of Tony visiting us and working on some aspect of our reform programme up here. I think we talked a  while ago about how it would be good to get Tony on to a housing project and I particularly wanted to show  him this one because it’s self help housing. That’s the idea I’m trying to push: self help housing. You put  your own sweat in, you pay a loan back, you know, and that pride and achievement is palpable amongst the  families here. So, I’m really pleased that Tony could join the family this week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Noel.

Look it’s terrific to be here. I’m really looking forward to the next few days. As Noel said, I’ve tried to come  to Cape York for a decade now. I really admire the work that Noel is doing. I think that it’s so important that  indigenous people don’t just rely on government for their own flourishing. I think that Noel’s work to try to  get people more active in their own advancement is so important and I’ve been coming up here again and  again because I want to give it all the support I can.

In 2008, I spent three weeks as a teacher’s aide in Coen. In 2009, I spent 10 days on the truancy team in  Aurukun. I’m going to be out here for a few days helping the Bush Owner Builder scheme here and I’m very  looking forward to getting my hands dirty and to helping and also, let’s be honest, learning some new skills  myself because there’s a lot to be learnt up here by anyone. So, I’m looking forward to learning up here.

But most of all I want to support Noel Pearson’s efforts, the efforts of the people of Cape York, the efforts  of the Cape York Partnerships, the Cape York Institute, to try to demonstrate that there is a different way  forward for Aboriginal people. This can be a model for Aboriginal people right around Australia but it can  actually be a model for all Australians everywhere. If you wait for government to save you, you will wait a  very long time and what you might get might not be what you want but if you engage in serious self help, if  you put your own skin in the game, it’s amazing what you can achieve. Government should be facilitating  that, not thinking that it has all the answers.

ALAN TUDGE:

Let me just say it’s great to be up here. I’ve been involved with the Cape for over 10 years now, including  having been the deputy director to Noel Pearson for three years, several years ago and it’s great to be up  here with my new boss now, Tony Abbott, as a member of parliament. I mean, this part of the world is a real  source of both inspiration and innovation and Noel Pearson’s work is something that we should all be  looking very closely at, not only for applicability in other indigenous areas but I also think applicability in  other disadvantaged areas in Australia. The particular project which we’re working on here is a self help  project which is exactly the philosophy which underpins a lot of the Pearson agenda which I think is a model  for elsewhere.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you have said that businesses shouldn’t buy carbon permits because you intend to rescind the  Government’s clean energy policy. Will you compensate them if they do?

TONY ABBOTT:

What I’ve said is don’t buy any permits that you don’t need now. That’s what I’ve said. Don’t buy forward  permits. Now, that way I think we can close down the scheme expeditiously, at least cost to the taxpayer and  with least disruption to business.

QUESTION:

But is that an acknowledgement that you will pay compensation because there will be a cost to taxpayers?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to make it very clear to business that they should not buy permits that they don’t need now and if  they don’t buy permits that they don’t need now, we can close down the scheme as quickly as possible with  as little cost as possible to taxpayers and as little disruption as possible to business.

QUESTION:

Is it responsible, now that the tax has passed through parliament, to still be telling businesses not to buy  permits? Does that create an unhealthy level of business uncertainty?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I’m just warning business that we are serious here. We will close this scheme down. We need to close it  down to take the pressure off prices and to protect Australian jobs. So, we will close it down and that’s why  I say don’t buy any permits that you don’t absolutely need now.

QUESTION:

So there’s no uncertainty for business?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s the best way of resolving any uncertainty and the other point I should make is that this scheme will  actually cost taxpayers $4 billion over the forward estimates period. So, it’s not as if this is just a free gift  from businesses as things stand.

QUESTION:

Can I ask about Nauru? It’s emerged that Chris Bowen urged Nauru as a solution to the immigration  impasse and was rolled by the left faction while other right figures backed him. What’s your response to  that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is a government which is slowly dying of shame. It really is. It’s a government which has lost  control of our borders. If you can’t control our borders, you can’t govern the country. Now, in the wake of  an extraordinary policy disaster with enormous ramifications for our country, the Cabinet is literally leaking  like a sieve. Now, it’s shambolic, it’s embarrassing, it’s bad for our country and, frankly, the sooner we have  an election better.

QUESTION:

Would you still negotiate with Chris Bowen and the Government on Nauru?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am very happy to see offshore processing at Nauru or at Manus Island and if the Government wants to pass  legislation to do that and that alone, it can be passed tomorrow. What I’m not going to do is to connive at the  Malaysia people-swap which was a cruel deal for boat people and a dud deal for Australia.

QUESTION:

So you would work with the Government towards a Nauru…

TONY ABBOTT:

If they want to open Nauru and Manus and dump Malaysia I am very happy to work with the Government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister has basically said if a whole lot of boats turn up as a result of last week’s  impasse, that it will be your fault. Do you accept that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, if the Prime Minister is incapable of stopping the boats she should accept that she’s not capable of  governing the country. Simple as that. It’s the Government’s fault if the boats start up again. It was the  Government that changed policy, that started the boats again in the first place and more boats just mean  more failures from this Government.

QUESTION:

Is Mr Bowen’s position untenable now, given that he pushed, or he’s the architect of the Malaysia solution  and now he’s…

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, no, the Prime Minister was the architect of the Malaysia solution. Chris Bowen was just the errand  boy for the Prime Minister on the Malaysian solution. So, I think it is the Prime Minister who’s in trouble  here, not just Chris Bowen. It is the Government which has failed here, not just Chris Bowen. Yes, Chris  Bowen’s position is untenable but so is the Prime Minister’s position.

QUESTION:

But it is conventional with debacles like the one we saw last week, for the portfolio minister to take  responsibility. Peter Garrett resigned for decisions in the insulation programme that were effectively Kevin  Rudd’s. Don’t you think Chris Bowen has an obligation to accept responsibility?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think someone has an obligation to accept responsibility but the responsibility here is much more the  Prime Minister’s than Chris Bowen’s and Peter Garrett, I should remind people, did not resign. That was the  whole point. He did not resign. He did not take responsibility. This is a government which never takes  responsibility for its mistakes, which always blames its mistakes on others and as we are now seeing so  clearly, the Government’s plan B is the blame game.

QUESTION:

Immigration Department head Andrew Metcalfe said that the end of offshore processing could lead to, well  obviously, an increase in boats, a tear at the fabric of society and European-style unrest. Do you think that  European-style unrest is a possibility in Australia now that onshore processing is the only…

TONY ABBOTT:

Two points. First of all, Australia is very different from France and I do not anticipate anything happening in  our country analogous to the kind of things we’ve seen in France and to a lesser extent in Britain over the  last few years. That’s the first point. Second point I make is that yes, we should have offshore processing.  The Coalition absolutely supports offshore processing. We invented offshore processing. We have the patent  on offshore processing. The Government can have offshore processing if they accept Nauru. They can have  offshore processing if they accept Nauru but, you see, the Government had a choice this week. It could have  accepted the Coalition’s policy or the Greens’ policy. It chose the Greens’ policy. The Government has  chosen onshore processing, so all of the problems that Andrew Metcalfe pointed to, the Government has  embraced. Andrew Metcalfe’s testimony shows how wrong the Government is to be now onshore  processing when it could have Nauru.

QUESTION:

But didn’t Mr Metcalfe say Nauru wouldn’t work anymore?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it worked in the past. I see no reason why it can’t work again in the future, particularly in conjunction  with temporary protection visas and the option of turning boats around where it’s safe to do so.

QUESTION:

Mr Pearson spoke to you about Wild Rivers. You’ve reintroduced your private member’s bill. How could it  possibly succeed without the support of Labor and the Greens?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I accept that it will be very difficult to get it through the Senate without the support of the Labor Party.  I deeply regret that the Labor Party has basically filibustered on this bill, past the 1st of July when there was  more hope of getting it through the Senate but, look, it’s the right policy and I’ll keep pushing it. That’s my  job, to keep pushing good policy and hope that one day we have a good government that will implement it.

QUESTION:

You accept that it is very difficult. Is it now time to speak to Campbell Newman? Is he your great white  hope to get Wild Rivers overturned?

TONY ABBOTT:

Campbell Newman is committed to a new deal for the people of Cape York. Campbell Newman has  accepted that the Wild Rivers legislation has to go. Yes, we need environmental protection on Cape York,  everyone accepts that, but Campbell Newman will repeal the Wild Rivers legislation should he form  government.

QUESTION:

No, he - well I asked him that the other day and he said he could change the existing legislation or he could  replace it with something else. He’s still equivocating.  Have you spoken to him about that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right. He is going to change the Wild Rivers legislation so that it does not interfere with the  legitimate rights of Aboriginal people to have economic development on their land.

QUESTION:

So, you’re comfortable with his position? Have you spoken to him about…

TONY ABBOTT:

I have spoken to him. I have spoken to Campbell. Campbell thinks that the Wild Rivers legislation was put  in place to appease the Greens. It’s been an attack on genuine land rights for Aboriginal people and it’s got  to go.
