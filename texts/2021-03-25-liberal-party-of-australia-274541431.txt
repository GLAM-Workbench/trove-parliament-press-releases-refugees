STATEMENT ON FIRE AT COX’S BAZAR

I am deeply saddened by the news of the devastating fire in the Kutupalong Balukali  refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. I offer my sincere condolences to those who  have lost loved ones. The impact on over 120,000 people and the extensive damage to  food distribution centres, health clinics, learning centres and essential facilities is of  great concern to Australia and the international community.  I commend the response of the Government of Bangladesh and Rohingya volunteers  who assisted with bringing the fire under control and the initial rescue operation, and the  humanitarian agencies delivering food assistance, emergency shelter, and water and  sanitation services for those affected.  Australia is committed to sustaining our humanitarian assistance for the Rohingya and  host communities in Cox’s Bazar. In light of this devastating event, I announce today an  additional $10 million in emergency assistance from the existing humanitarian budget to  those affected by the fire. Our additional support will be provided through the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration,  the World Food Programme and the United Nations Population Fund.  This funding is in addition to the over $260 million Australia has provided to the  humanitarian response for Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh  since 2017.
