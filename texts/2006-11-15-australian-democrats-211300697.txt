High Court Decision on TPVs Leaves Refugees in Limbo

The Australian Democrats have expressed dismay at today's High Court decision making it easier for  refugees to be returned by governments.

"The decision seems to be an exceedingly narrow and unrealistic interpretation of the Refugee  Convention," Senator Bartlett said.

"This decision will make it easier for the government to leave refugees in limbo.

"Once an asylum seeker has been assessed as a refugee they should be allowed to rebuild their lives  here, not be under constant threat of repatriation to unstable or unsafe situations.

"It is impossible to have confidence in the government's ability to assess the risk in returning a refugee to  their country of origin when according to well researched reports from the Edmund Rice Centre, the  government has failed to accurately assess the risk in returning people in the past.

"I have introduced a Private Senators' Bill into parliament to remove the unfair and harmful Temporary  Protection Visas from the Migration Act. I hope that the High Court's decision will spur my Liberal  colleagues to take action and support the Bill in the interest of fairness and to uphold human rights,"  Senator Bartlett concluded.
