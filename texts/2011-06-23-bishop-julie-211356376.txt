Your Excellency, friends from the Indonesian Embassy and diplomatic corps, distinguished  guests, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to the Association this evening.

As Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I acknowledge and appreciate the tireless  work that your organisation undertakes to further awareness and understanding between our  countries.

The work that you do comes at a crucial period in Australia’s relationship with Indonesia, and  with the Asia Pacific more generally, for what we are witnessing in our region is nothing  short of the dawn of a new era in international relations - a fundamental change in the  international system that has the potential to rewrite the way the world, as we currently know  it, operates.

The impact of this development will reach down into Australia’s domestic political  environment, altering the basis of our economy and presenting us with a unique set of  opportunities and challenges.

To speak of Asia’s rise however, with no mention of its once dominant position in the  international system, fails to fully capture the transformative nature of what is now  happening.

Rather than Asia’s rise, what we are seeing is Asia’s re-emergence after centuries of  dormancy.

The observation that a country’s population determined its economic output, and therefore its  power and influence on the international stage, is again coming to the fore.

The industrial revolution now underway in Asia is returning the region to its traditional  position as an economic powerhouse.

While the world’s focus has been fixed on North and South Asia, Indonesia has quietly  undergone an even greater transformation over the last decade.

Unlike some other emerging powers, Indonesia’s economic development has been matched  by political reforms which have granted greater levels of freedom and opportunity to its  people.

Consisting of close to 245 million people, speaking hundreds of languages and spread over an  archipelago of over 17,000 islands, the success of its democratic revolution has been a  leading light for other peoples throughout the world.

At a time when much of the Middle East is in turmoil, Indonesia has shown the world what is  possible.

At the start of the 1980s, per capita wealth in Indonesia was on average US$644. Forty per  cent of Indonesians were living below the poverty line of US$1.25 per day.

Since the low point of the Asian Financial Crisis, Indonesia has benefited from a decade of  sustained economic growth, averaging close to 5 per cent per year.

By 2008 the Indonesian economy was twice the size of its pre-crisis peak, with the average  wealth of Indonesians doubling over this period.

Figures from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) show that Indonesia’s  gross domestic product will exceed $800 billion for the first time in 2011.

According to the International Monetary Fund, growth in ASEAN-5 countries “will be led by  Indonesia, where strong consumption and a recovery in investment will raise growth to 6 ¼  per cent this year and 6 ½ per cent in 2012”.

This strong level of economic growth has enabled Indonesia to capitalise on its ‘demographic  dividend’.  With a youth ratio of 36 per cent, Indonesia still has huge reserves of human  capital upon which to draw.

The success of Indonesia’s economic transformation is evident in the fact that it is a highly  valued member of the G20, the world’s premier forum for international economic  cooperation.

Indonesia’s economic achievements coupled with its continued strong rate of economic  growth will quickly transform it into a major centre of power.

In the same way that Asia is now in a pivotal period in its history, Australia’s relationship  with Indonesia has reached a crucial turning point.

With economic growth comes increased influence and responsibility.  With its size, Indonesia  is a natural leader in South East Asia.

As history has shown us, changes in relative power between nations present both  opportunities and challenges.

As Michael Wesley, Executive Director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy, has  pointed out, Indonesia’s superior rate of economic growth will propel its economy past  Australia’s within a decade.

Should Indonesia achieve its growth targets, it will be become one of the world’s tenth largest

economies by 2015.

The result of this will be a shift in the broad issues which have largely defined the  relationship up to this point.

As President Yudhoyono stated in his address to the Australian Parliament in 2010, a key  challenge to our future partnership will be how to address the issues brought about by a new  strategic reality.

Australia must use the time now before it to work with Indonesia to develop the framework  within which our relationship will mature and evolve in the coming decades.

I had the opportunity to meet with President Yudhoyono during his visit to Parliament House  and he observed that the average Australian appeared to know little of Indonesia, beyond  Bali, and the average Indonesia knew little of Australia.

We must improve mutual understanding and respect between our people so that the  relationship overall can prosper.

This includes building up the economic ties that bind and mutually benefit our two countries.   At present, this economic relationship falls far short of its potential.

According to DFAT, two-way merchandise trade in 2010 was valued at $9.8 billion, with  trade in services worth a further $3 billion.

Indonesia was Australia’s 11th largest export market.

That New Zealand with a population of only 4.4 million - or less than two per cent of  Indonesia’s population - ranked higher says much about the state of Australia’s trade  relationship with Indonesia.

Australian banking, construction, mining and transportation companies have led the way with  sizable investments in Indonesia.

The Commonwealth Bank for example has operated in Indonesia for almost the last 15 years,  operating more than 80 branches across the country and employing more than 1,500 people.   It now provides financial services to more than 84,000 customers.

BlueScope Steel, Leighton Contractors Indonesia and ANZ Bank also have a strong presence  in the country.

While there is a good base from which to work, much more needs to be done.

In 2007, Australia - under the Howard Government - and Indonesia launched a joint  feasibility study to examine the merits of a bilateral free trade agreement.

The study showed that “an ambitious FTA, encompassing goods, services and investment”  would “deliver real trade and economic benefits to both countries”.

The Coalition supports an Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership as a  way to boost investment and productivity, encourage greater levels of competition and build  on efforts to promote economic integration between our two countries.



Rather than strengthening our economic relationship, the Gillard Government has dealt it a  heavy blow by suspending Australia’s live cattle exports to Indonesia.

Figures released by DFAT reveal that live animal exports to Indonesia were valued at $320  million last year.

According to reports, an estimated 520,000 head of cattle were to be shipped to Indonesia this  year, supplying approximately 25 per cent of the country’s beef needs.

The close relationship that Australia enjoys with Indonesia should have enabled the  Australian Government to have an open dialogue when faced with issues, such as that  presented by the ABC’s Four Corners program on the live cattle export trade.

Sadly, in what has become a customary practice for this Government, this decision to impose  a ban on cattle exports to Indonesia was made without any warning or consultation with the  Indonesian Government.

Understandably, the Indonesian Government has registered its frustration at being kept in the  dark and there are credible reports of increasing diplomatic tensions between our two  governments.

The situation has not been helped by the fact that Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd and Trade  Minister Craig Emerson appear to have chosen to distance themselves from the issue in the  hope of avoiding being tarnished by the Government’s latest political and diplomatic blunder.

It is well past time for the Foreign Minister to become personally involved by travelling to  Jakarta to take control of negotiations to restart the trade and to seek to head off the looming  trade and diplomatic disaster.

I have called on him to do so without delay. The Foreign Minister should travel to Jakarta and  must be at the forefront of this critical issue. His lack of involvement in the negotiations to  date is unacceptable.

The Australian Ambassador to Indonesia Greg Moriarty has opined that live cattle exports  will not return to their previous level for a considerable period, even if there is an early  resumption in trade.

Indeed there is such a lack of confidence in the competence of the Gillard Government that  the Western Australian State Government has dispatched its own state minister to Indonesia  to deal directly with the Indonesian Government to see what can be done to resolve this issue.

The cattle industry in Australia is in crisis, jobs in Australia and Indonesia are at risk and the  livelihood of thousands of people has been damaged.

Given the way the Australian Government has managed the relationship with Indonesia over  this issue, one is reminded of the Government’s failure to consult Indonesia over the  proposed regional processing centre mooted for East Timor and its failure to consult  Indonesia over the proposed Malaysia asylum seeker swap.

Further one cannot help but be reminded of the ineptitude with which the same Labor  Government caused tensions with Indonesia over the Oceanic Viking standoff in 2009.



Turning to a more positive note, building an effective framework for future engagement also  requires that we address issues here at home which affect our ability to broaden and deepen  the relationship.

A key aspect of this is language education.

A recent audit undertaken found that 99 per cent of high school students who study  Indonesian have dropped it by their final year.

This is trend is matched at the tertiary level.  According to reports, enrolments for Indonesian  courses across the nation have plummeted by 30 per cent between 2002 and 2009.

Under the Howard Government, federal funding agreements were leveraged to prevent  Australian universities from closing down Indonesian language course without the approval  of the federal government.

As Minister for Education, I recognised the strategic importance of building up our  Indonesian language capacity if Australia’s national interests were to be advanced.

I therefore noted with concern Julia Gillard’s decision as Education Minister to approve a  request from Curtin University to abandon its Indonesian language program in 2009.

Given the importance of our relationship, the proximity of our shores, and the shared set of  challenges and opportunities that confront us, Australia should aspire to lead the world in  understanding the issues that drive Indonesian society and its government.

The decline in Indonesian language skills in our country limits our ability to maximise our  engagement across a wide range of areas including limiting new opportunities for Australian  businesses and exporters.

A recent report commissioned by Asialink and the Australian Industry Group found that 74  per cent of Australian businesses surveyed indicated an interest in expanding into Asia.  Indonesia, along with China, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, all rated highly as  popular markets for Australian businesses.

When asked about the skill factors required for doing business with Asian countries, an  appreciation for different political and legal processes; local cultural knowledge; and local  language skills all featured prominently.

In its education and training blueprint, Skills for a Nation, the Australian Chamber of  Commerce and Industry argued that if Australia was “to effectively participate in a  globalised world there should be the compulsory learning of a foreign language from 7 years  of age or earlier”.

This position was strongly supported by groups such as the Asia Education Foundation and  the Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations.

I strongly believe that we should heed this call from the business community. It is a common  practice across the world to make foreign language tuition compulsory and it was recently  introduced into the UK curriculum.

I believe a laudable aim for an Australian Government is to ensure all school children learn a  second language in addition to English. As Education Minister I championed a national  curriculum for core subjects - the time has come for a mandatory second language to be  incorporated into our national education system.

Throughout my time as Minister for Education I was also acutely conscious of the small  number of Australian students choosing to study abroad.

From my own experience, I understand and value the benefits that come from the opportunity  to live, study and learn overseas.

As Asia continues its re-emergence, and its importance to our national prosperity grows,  Australia must work to increase people to people links within the region.

The Coalition has a distinguished record in this regard, having established the Colombo Plan  under the Menzies Government.

In the lead up to the last election, I announced that a Coalition Government would promote  greater international student exchange opportunities.

In an era of increasing interconnectedness between nations, it is essential that the Australian  Government encourage students to do everything they can to learn from other cultures and  political systems.

Student exchange is a vital form of soft diplomacy - think of the United States in that regard.  Having a critical mass of young people who have spent time living and studying in another  country is a valuable asset for developing future relations with that country.

I recognise that student exchanges have added the benefit of fostering greater understanding  of Australia, our values and interests.

There are a number of cases where students have studied in Australia and have become  decision makers in their own country - such as Dr Marty Natalegawa, Indonesia’s Foreign  Minister and ANU alumni - and their understanding of Australia is invaluable.

This framework must also include increased opportunities for government to government  interaction and twinning in key development areas.

While international development assistance will continue to feature strongly in our  relationship, its importance will diminish over time as the benefits of Indonesia’s economic  growth filters downwards.

Like all areas of Australian Government expenditure, we must ensure that this assistance is  applied efficiently and to maximum effectiveness.

Ultimately however, it will be Indonesia’s economic development and the employment  opportunities it creates that will lift the living standards of its citizens, not greater levels of  Australian aid.

As Indonesia’s economy grows, so too will calls for it to play a more active role in regional  security and economic affairs.

As close friends and strategic partners, Australia and Indonesia are well placed to work  together as equals to promote regional cooperation and policy coordination, bilaterally and as  well as through existing institutional architecture.

This comes at a crucial point in time in the region.

As Rod Lyon and Will Clegg, analysts at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, have  written “Southeast Asia is approaching a strategic moment that might well define its place  for the next few decades”.

As economic and strategic power shifts to further Asia, our region will become more  contested than it has in its recent history.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, arms deliveries to South  East Asia nearly doubled in the period 2005-2009, when compared to the previous five years.

Arms deliveries to Malaysia, for example, increased by over 700 per cent, to Singapore by  146 per cent and to Indonesia by 84 per cent.

The world’s attention focused on the region last year, following the Chinese Government’s  declaration of the South China Sea as a ‘core national interest’.

This statement caused considerable concern throughout the region, particularly in countries  with competing territorial claims.

With an estimated $1 trillion of its trade passing through the South China Sea each year, the  United States has a strong stake in maintaining the openness of sea lanes of communication  in the region.

India’s long-standing Ã¢ÂÂLook EastÃ¢ÂÂ policy, designed to deepen its economic interests in East  and Southeast Asia through closer integration with ASEAN nations, means that it will also  have a strong stake in future direction of the region.

The growing importance of the Indian Ocean Region will require littoral states like Australia  and Indonesia to work closely together to resolve issues such as illegal fishing, people  smuggling and piracy.

Working together to promote security and development in the Indian Ocean Region will  become increasing critical for Australia as an ever greater share of our national prosperity  comes out of Western Australia.

Much of this wealth is located on the west and northwest coasts of Australia.  According to  the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, 90 per cent of our recoverable  reserves of natural gas are located in these waters.

This point was picked up by the analysts at ASPI in early 2010, who believe that “the huge  economic importance and vulnerability of this area seem underappreciated in our national  strategic planning”.

The Coalition therefore welcomes the review of Australia’s defence force posture as long  overdue.  In particular I have long called for there to be consideration of a defence presence  in our north west and note that at last this is under active consideration.



We do not pretend that our relationship is perfect or will be free from challenge in the years  ahead.  No relationship is, or could ever hope to be.

From the challenges of East Timor’s independence in 1999, our relationship has grown into  the close friendship than now exists.

The tragedies of Bali - where so many young Australians and Indonesians died at the hands  of an intolerant few - will forever be etched in our collective memories.

We remain deeply appreciative of the joint co-operation efforts of the Australian and  Indonesian authorities on counter terrorism and bringing the perpetrators of terrorism to  justice.

For all of Indonesia’s successes in recent years, perhaps the hardest part of its development  lies ahead.  As a friend and strategic partner, Australia is committed to help Indonesia find its  way through whatever challenges the future has in store.

I would like to suggest an initiative that I believe would do much to enhance our relations -  the establishment of an Australia-Indonesia Leadership Dialogue, along the lines of the  highly successful Australia-US Dialogue.

Bringing together influential decision makers from our respective countries from  government, business and industry, academia and the media on an annual basis, rotating  between Jakarta and Canberra, would be a welcome addition I suggest, to the strengthening  of our relationship - Ambassador we must get together to discuss in more detail!

While there are many pressing issues throughout the world - and some which require urgent  action - it is within our region that Australia can do the most good.

Australia’s influence with our friends and allies in the United States and Europe is at its  greatest when our standing in the region is strong.  That must be the first priority of any  Australian Government.

In his recent book, Ã¢ÂÂThere goes the NeighbourhoodÃ¢ÂÂ, Michael Wesley sounded a warning to  Australia to prepare for the fundamental changes that are currently taking place in Asia.  Its  economic re-emergence will alter the foundations upon which Australians view and interact  with the world.

Preparing for this change will require action from the Australian Government both here at  home and abroad.

Central to this will be strengthening our relationship with our partner to the north, Indonesia.

Building and securing a framework for future engagement will be an essential part of  Australia’s foreign policy in the years ahead.
