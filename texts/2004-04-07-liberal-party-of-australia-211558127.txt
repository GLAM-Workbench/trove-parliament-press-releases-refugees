DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO EAST TIMOR

I have today announced the appointment of Margaret Twomey as Australia’s Ambassador to East  Timor.

Ms Twomey will replace Mr Paul Foley who has been Ambassador since July 2002.  Ms Twomey  is expected to take up her appointment in July 2004.

Ms Twomey’s appointment comes at a time when the ties of friendship between Australia and  independent East Timor are stronger then ever.  The opening of the interim East Timorese Embassy  in Canberra late last year was an important milestone in the deepening community, business and  government links between our two countries.

As a close neighbour and good friend, Australia will remain at the forefront of international support to  East Timor and will continue to be a strong advocate of the new nation in the international arena.   Our significant development, defence and police cooperation programs will continue to assist the  government and people of East Timor to build a secure and prosperous future.  Australia is also  encouraging the UN Security Council to agree to another security-focused successor UN mission in  East Timor after May 2004 to safeguard stability and the important gains made to date in nation-building.

Ms Margaret Twomey is an experienced career diplomat with the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Trade and is currently Assistant Secretary, Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe Branch.  Other  positions held include Executive Officer, Strategic Assessments Branch (1994-95); and Desk  Officer, East Europe Section (1988-89).  Ms Twomey also served as an analyst in the Office of  National Assessments (1992-94).

Overseas, Ms Twomey has served as Deputy High Commissioner in Suva (2000-2002); First  Secretary and Counsellor in London (1995-2000); and Third and Second Secretary in Belgrade  (1990-92).

Born in 1963, Ms Twomey has an honours degree in Arts (Russian and French) from the University  of Melbourne.
