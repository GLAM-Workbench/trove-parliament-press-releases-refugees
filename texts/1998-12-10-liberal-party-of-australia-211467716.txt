50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS

Â

The 50th an niversary today of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights provides an opportunity to reflect on Australia’s significant 
contribution to the cause of human rights both overseas and at home, 
the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
said today.

Â

The Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly 
of the United Nations 50 years ago today following the end of World 
War II.

Â

“The Declaration of Human Rights is regarded as 
the cornerstone of the international human rights system upon which 
the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and other human rights standards have been 
developed,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“Throughout the past 50 years, Australia has been 
at the forefront of international efforts to prevent, alleviate and 
respond to the many humanitarian and refugee crises and situations which 
continue to arise around the world.

Â

“Australians can be proud of the very practical 
approach we have taken in the last 50 years by offering the opportunity 
in Australia to some 600,000 refugees and people in refugee-like situations.

Â

“We plan to take another 12,000 people in 1998-99, 
and are proud of the fact that on a per capita basis, this country operates 
one of the largest refugee and humanitarian resettlement programs in 
the world.

Â

“Australia is recognised internationally as a world 
leader for the high levels of settlement services and post-arrival care 
we provide for refugees and other humanitarian settlers.

Â

“For example, we provide subsidised temporary accommodation 
on arrival, and, for people who have suffered torture and trauma, counselling 
services.

Â

“We are also assisted by the support of the volunteers 
in the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme who help new arrivals to 
settle and ensure they know how to obtain various mainstream services.

Â

“The Coalition’s commitment to assisting those 
people that may have suffered torture or trauma is also reflected by 
the provision of $20.8 million over four years for a national program 
to coordinate and consolidate humanitarian settlement services for this 
vulnerable group.

Â

“The Government is committed to continue to support 
refugees who are in need of the protection and services that resettlement 
in Australia offers”.
