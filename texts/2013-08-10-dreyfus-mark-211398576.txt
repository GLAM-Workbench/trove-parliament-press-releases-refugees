LIPSON:       Another busy day on the road for our reporters, and of course the  leaders as well. Joining me now, the Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus in our  Melbourne studio. Thanks for your time. I want to start with the polls this morning. Is  the honeymoon for Kevin Rudd finished?

MARK DREYFUS:   We always knew, David that the election was going to be tight.  We're the underdog. And we also know that Tony Abbott's got to where he's got on  massive negativity.

We can expect to see a lot more of that. But what I'm looking forward to, particularly  in this debate tomorrow night, is some detail from Tony Abbott and the Liberal Party.

Some detail on where they're going to cut, some detail on their plans for the  economy. I'm very confident in our plans. I'm very confident we've got positive plans  for the future, we've got detail. We've seen precious little of that from Tony Abbott up  until now, which is why I think the debate tomorrow night on the economy is very  important.

LIPSON:       Well, why don't people trust this Government when it comes to the  economy, according to this poll?

MARK DREYFUS:   Well, I think that the polls move around, and I don't accept that  premise that you've just put to me.

I'm looking forward to the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook next week,  that's on Tuesday.

Because finally, we've got Tony Abbott, who was refusing to accept the Charter of  Budget Honesty framework set up by John Howard and Peter Costello. Now, he is, it  seems.

I'm looking forward to that PEFO announcement next week. That's going to provide a  framework by which we can judge the Liberal Party's policies. I say again to you  David, this is about detail.

This is about what the Liberal Party is going to do, what they are going to cut, where  they are going to find the $70b of cuts that they've talked about. That's the important  thing, because-

LIPSON:      What about in Queensland? Just before we move on, I just want to  direct you to Queensland, where Kevin Rudd, well, the Kevin Rudd effect, you could  call it, hasn't been as great as the ALP surely would have hoped. Are you  disappointed that he hasn't had more of an impact in his home state?

MARK DREYFUS:   We've got 29 days to go in this campaign. Finally, itâ€™s crunch  time for Tony Abbott and the Liberals, they can't just keep talking in three-word  slogans.

I'm very confident that Kevin Rudd is able to explain a very clear vision, a positive  vision for our country, positive economic policies

And I don't think that the Liberal Party, what they've got to offer, which is cuts, where  in Queensland in particular, where we've had a curtain-raiser from the Newman  Government of what a conservative government looks like, where they don't tell you  about their cuts before the election, and immediately after the election it's into slash  and burn. That's what Tony Abbott would deliver to the people in Queensland.

LIPSON:       Okay. Well as Special Minister of State, your role there, you have  approved the continuation of this asylum seeker ad campaign. Not just overseas, but  in Australia. Now the Shadow Attorney-General has described this as a scandal,  because it has happened without the approval of the Opposition.

Why is it that these ads are needed in Australia, and that you have broken the  convention of not having the Opposition on board to actually run these sorts of ads  during caretaker period?

MARK DREYFUS:   Well, just to deal with that last point first, David, I haven't broken  any convention. There's a political practice of consulting the Opposition. I've  consulted the Opposition. George Brandis's claims have been absurd.

But more to the point, this advertising is needed. It's a ridiculous suggestion from this  Opposition, when they have been saying for years and years that there are people-smuggling syndicates operating in Australia.  That people are making contact with  people-smugglers here in Australia to try and get their friends and relatives from  other countries.  That we shouldn't be advertising in Australia just as much as  overseas.

And it's consistent, however, with this Opposition that said that they supported the  Papua New Guinea Regional Resettlement Arrangement, but have done everything  they can since the 19th of July to undermine that arrangement.

LIPSON:       But in your correspondence with the Shadow Attorney-General, there  was reference made to the ad campaign not continuing unless it had the approval of  the Opposition. They haven't approved this ad to run in Australia. They have  approved it to run overseas, but not in this country. So why was that written in the  correspondence, if all that was needed was consultation?

MARK DREYFUS:   As usual David, George Brandis has misstated and  misrepresented what the situation actually is. My letter said nothing of the kind. It  sought the views of the leader of the Opposition on this advertising campaign, and in  no sense does the Opposition have a right of veto.

So George Brandis talking nonsense as usual.  But we expected that the Opposition  would want to try and interrupt and undermine the advertising, just as much as  they've tried to undermine a whole lot of the details of this Papua New Guinea  arrangement.

I think it should be dismissed for what it is: Party political game-playing, not putting  the national interest first.

This is a national security matter, David. We need to continue with the whole of this  campaign, because we've got to get the message out that if you come to Australia by  boat without a visa, you will not be settled in Australia.  That message needs to go to  all points of the pipeline.

LIPSON:       If it's all above board, can you tell us then how much taxpayer money  will be spent on this campaign during the caretaker period?

MARK DREYFUS:   It's certainly nothing like the $30m that has been suggested in  The Daily Telegraph. I can't give you the exact figure. Up until now, the onshore, the  Australian campaign has been something in the order of about $2.6 million, and  certainly, we'll be accounting for every dollar, and I'll be making clear exactly what  has been spent-

LIPSON:       - So will it be somewhere in that ballpark? $2.6m? Similar time period?

MARK DREYFUS:   Well no, that's what's been spent to date. There's another two  weeks or so of the onshore campaign in the major newspapers to go, and about,  some further weeks.

It's really up to Tony Burke, as Immigration Minister, on the detail of ads that will be  running in ethnic media, which is a somewhat longer campaign. But the key period  here to make sure this arrangement works is now in August.

And also, as Tony Burke said yesterday, to make sure that people-smugglers do not  say that because of the election, somehow the policy is not continuing. We need to  make it clear that even though the election is on, this new policy is in place, it is  being implemented.

We've had four transfers go to Papua New Guinea already, and further transfers will  be going next week. The policy is being implemented, and there are early signs,  David, that it is working.

LIPSON:       Okay. Well Warren Mundine will head a super-advisory body under  Tony Abbott if he's elected Prime Minister.  That announcement's going to be made  today, on Indigenous policy. Do you support that? Particularly since he is a former  ALP president.

MARK DREYFUS:   I don't think that anything that Tony Abbott's saying in  Indigenous affairs is to be believed.

He talks big in Indigenous affairs, but you've got to look at the record of his party in  Government, and the record of his party in Opposition. This is the party that refused  to say sorry to Indigenous people.

This is the party that cut funding to Indigenous services. And in Opposition, this is  the party that refused to commit to the Closing the Gap targets. Most recently,  extraordinarily in March this year, David, just the week after Tony Abbott gave a  major speech saying that his heart was in Aboriginal affairs.

His party, at his instruction, voted against the - confirming the tax treatment of native  title compensation payments, apparently because that's what the mining industry in  Western Australia wanted them to do.

So look at what the Liberal Party does, and compare it to the very strong record that  Labor has, in Opposition and in Government, of putting our weight behind  Indigenous matters.

We're the party that's apologised. We're the party that's put in the Closing the Gap  target. What's Tony Abbott going to do about - he's going up to the Territory today,  perhaps he should have a word to Adam Giles about why the new CLP Government  in the Northern Territory abolished the Banned Drinkers' Register?

Or is reintroducing mandatory sentencing that's going to double the Indigenous  prison population in the Northern Territory in the next four years? They're the things  that I want to see Tony Abbott dealing with.

LIPSON:       Are you saying that Tony Abbott doesn't care about Indigenous  Australia?

MARK DREYFUS:   I'm saying look at his record. He talks big, but when you look at  what he had done in Government, the cuts that he made as Health Minister, the cuts  that the Howard Government made to services to Indigenous people, the failure of  him in Opposition to put his weight behind the Closing the Gap targets, the failure to  vote for tax treatment of native title compensation payments, when they had the  opportunity in March this year.

All of this tells you that it's all talk, and it won't be any action. I just don't accept,  looking at the record of the Liberal Party, looking at the record of the National Party,  or the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory over the last 30 years, or the

record of the Liberal Party in Opposition, that they're to be believed on anything they  say in Indigenous matters.

It's going to be part of the cuts. Tony Abbott's refused to say where his cuts will be in  Indigenous affairs, just like he's refused to say where his cuts are going to fall  elsewhere.

LIPSON:       Alright. Well, in the seat of Hotham, which is being vacated by Simon  Crean, the ALP candidate there has admitted to abusing, using foul language  against a disabled woman. He's apologised for it. Is that enough?

MARK DREYFUS:   Those comments were inappropriate David. They were in 2002,  and Mr Lake has apologised.

LIPSON:       Should he be dumped?

MARK DREYFUS:   I say again, they were in 2002.  The comments were  inappropriate, and Mr Lake has apologised.

LIPSON:       Okay. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, thanks very much for your time  today.

MARK DREYFUS:   Thank you very much David.
