REYNOLDS:

Mr Howard, good morning. Thanks for your time.

HOWARD:

Good morning, how are you?

REYNOLDS:

Good thank you. What do you think o f the Newspoll?

HOWARD:

In some respects it’s good.

REYNOLDS:

What respects are those? .

HOWARD:

Well, because I think it drives home to Liberals all around Australia that this is going to be a  tough election fight I think some people thought because o f the poll leads w e’d  been  chalking up earlier that we had a lot o f electoral fat on our bones and we don’t. And it will  focus the attention o f the electorate. It will present to all the swinging voters the real  possibility that Mr Keating can be returned and people will have to ask themselves do they  want another three years like the last 13.

Do you get the sense though that when you talk to people in the electorate that the ALP is  gaining ground?

HOWARD:

Oh, you get mixed signals but what I get a  sense o f is that people arc wanting to know what  the two sides are offering in relation to the things that concern them most and that is youth  unemployment and pressure on families. They’re the two issues that will dominate the  remaining ten days o f this election campaign and which Party has a credible plan to do  something to generate jobs for young people. And which Party has a  credible policy to take  some o f the pressure off families. They arc the two issues that people will respond to most.

REYNOLDS:

Now, you’ve been concentrating obviously on selling the policies but how damaging do you  think that mistake was on radio yesterday?

HOWARD:

Oh, look the caravan moves on. You have those glitches...

REYNOLDS:

A bit embarrassing though.

HOWARD:

Oh, well in public life you have days like th a t All politicians do. Life moves on. The policy  is completely unaffected. It’s a policy which is delivering the maximum benefits for low  income people. It’s a  very carefiilly targeted policy and it is designed to ease a little bit the  pressure on families. It’s modest, it’s fully funded, it’s quite affordable. It represents less  than one per cent o f the total revenue o f the Commonwealth.

REYNOLDS:

Low income families but it also includes politicians families as well doesn’t it?

HOWARD:

Well, it certainly doesn’t include me; I don’t think it would include many politicians.

REYNOLDS:

REYNOLDS:

Don’t you?

-3-

No, very seriously Anna because....

REYNOLDS:

Well, it said it in the paper this morning, you’re sure about that?

HOW ARD:

Did it say it in the paper this morning? Well, as I understand it a politicians salary when you  throw in the allowance is close to  $100,000 and unless you expend all o f the allowance in a  tax deductable form you end up having a tax deductable amount that would take you above,  way above the minimum unless you had a particularly large family and at least one o f  them  was under five. I don’t think many Federal MPs would be entitled, I really don’t. I certainly  wouldn’t be,

REYNOLDS:

Well, let’s turn to the costings and the Prime Minister yesterday says your costings contain a  hole the size o f the Grand Canyon, that you haven’t taken into account the fixed grants to the  States. What’s your response to that?

H OW ARD:

Well, it’s just wrong. Completely, utterly, comprehensively, totally wrong. We are not going  to increase in real terms the money going to the States. We’re going to  give them a  fixed  share so they won’t be savaged in the way they have been over the last three years but the  Prime Minister you know really is just lying in his teeth when he says w e’re going to give

another $3 billion to the States. We are n o t

REYNOLDS:

If there is no problem with your costings though why not agree, indeed welcome, Department  o f Finance having a  look at them?

H OW ARD:

HOWARD:

Well, we have said that if  the Department o f Finance is to look at them they must also talk to  us about the basis on which the costing have been made otherwise they could easily produce  an inaccurate figure.

REYNOLDS:

Butt why is that necessary? Shouldn’t  they stand for themselves?

-4-

No, no they shouldn’t  because whenever you make proposals to out expenditure there are  assumptions underlying those proposals and in the absence o f talking to  the people who  proposed that you can easily get it wrong.

REYNOLDS*

But you can’t put that in  briefing form for them?

HOW ARD:

No, they ought to talk to  us and they won’t and I want to know why M r Beazley won’t allow  the Department o f Finance to talk to us, I also want to know why M r Beazley w on’t  allow  the Department o f Finance to tell the Australian people the current likely state o f next year’s  Budget.

REYNOLDS;

What do you think it is?

HOW ARD;

I don’t know.

REYNOLDS:

But what are you basing your costings on for it?

HOW ARD;

We can only base them bn the latest official figures.

REYNOLDS:

The $3 billion surplus? -

HOW ARD:

Yes, and that’s the latest figure and until the Government gives another figure, and it won’t,  and people are entitled to know why it won’t, what other figure can we base it on? And on  top o f that we have allowed for a  buffer in our figuring o f about $1 billion. W e will be  saving more from our spending cuts o f $ 1 billion than we will be committing to new  programmes. W e have $1 billion up our sleeve.

HOWARD:

-5-

Those spending cuts, $6.3 billion I think it is, that's a lot o f money to cu t Who’s going to  hurt most from those?

HOWARD:

Well, they won’t involve cutting any basic payments for people, pensions, social welfare  entitlements.

REYNOLDS:

So, no one should be worse off?

HOWARD:

Well, the only people who will be worse off are people who are cheating.

REYNOLDS:

You are really confident there is that much fat in the system?

HOWARD:

There’s a lot of fat in the system and we are certain that we can save the costings that have  been put there and there is a proposal to delay the entitlement for new migrants who come to  Australia and that’s a very just proposal because it won’t  affect refugees, it won’t  affect  people who come here on a humanitarian basis. And the rest o f those who come here, come  here on the basis that they are being in a sense supported or sponsored by others who are

already in Australia and there is no reason in those circumstances why the period which is  now six months oughtn’t  be extended to two years. But the expenditure reductions have been  carefully put together to be fair and I don’t think anybody objects to expenditure reductions  that involve, you know, the effect application o f tests and activity tests and tilings that  prevent any fraud in the social security system. It also proposes some re a c tio n  in the  operating costs o f the Public Service and a number o f other specific expenditure saving  measures. They won’t  be popular with some people but I think most Australians will  support the diversion o f resources from areas like that into giving benefits to families,  particularly low income families...

REYNOLDS:

All right.

HOWARD:

...and that essentially is what we have done.

REYNOLDS:

REYNOLDS:

Just going back to the costings. I mean, i f  the deficit does turn out to be way higher, which o f  course a lot o f  the private sector economists are forecasting, is it right that you are saying  indeed that your promises will not suffer but. the bottom line deficit will?

HOWARD;

Well, what I’ve said is that the underlying stuplus commitment has been based entirely on the  latest figures given by the Government, and it is a  hypothetical question as to  w hat we do if   that figure turns out to be wrong.

REYNOLDS:

But isn 't it a  reasonable question to expect the public to ask?

HOWARD:

Well, I think it is reasonable for the public to  know the true position and the only people who  can give the true position are the Government.

REYNOLDS:

Yes, but shouldn’t  they also be aware o f what you would do i f  that was the case?

HOWARD:

No, I have said Anna, that the commitment is to  have an underlying surplus is based on the  current figures. Now. you can draw your own conclusions - it is based on the current figure.

REYNOLDS:

Yes.

HOWARD;

I can't do any more than that. You are asking m e to answer a  completely hypothetical  question and the only people who can make it a  non-hypotiietical question are the members  o f the Government.

REYNOLDS:

Yes, I understand that, but politicians take the advice o f the private sector economists when  they want i t  They say this time that the deficit is likely to be significantly higher than the  Government estimates.

HOWARD:

Well that can be answered. That can be answered by the Government throwing open the  books.

REYNOLDS:

Sure.

HOWARD:

You and your colleagues keep saying ! have got to accept the Government is entitled to  deceive the people o f  Australia - keep things from the people o f Australia.

REYNOLDS:

That’s not what I’m saying at all. We put these questions at length to the Prime Minister  b u t...

HOWARD:

What’s his response? The Prime Minister’s response is to brush you o ff and ju st say, “Well,  you can’t ask me, the Prime Minister, to make this information available to the public. You  go back and ask Howard what he’s going to do in a hypothetical situation.” I think that’s an  absurd situation.

REYNOLDS:

So. you’re not going to say what you would do if  the deficit was significantly more?

HOWARD:

I ’m going to say again that the basis o f our commitment to have an underlying surplus are the  current estimates about the Budget T am going to tell you. definitely and without  qualification, any qualification, that the commitments that we have made to individuals in the  community - the tax commitment and the other commitments - they are going to  be  honoured. I remind you that the promise made on the underlying surplus was always based  on the state o f the books being as the Government has claimed.

REYNOLDS:

Right, OK. .

HOW ARD:

I can’t  be any clearer and more explicit than th a t

K E V N O I D S Â·

All right. We’ll move on then. W hat’s to come in terms o f  spending promises? Is there  much more?

HOW ARD:

Very M e .

REYNOLDS:

Very little. Nearly at the end o f  the line?

HOW ARD:

Very, very little. We have a  couple o f areas that we have foreshadowed but any suggestion -  and I notice that it emerges in the press this morning that there are some further very large  commitments, that’s wrong, and I can say that by the time all o f  the commitments have been  made we will have about $1 billion additional surplus. In other words, w e will have saved  about $1 billion more than we have committed in new programs. Any suggestion that there  are further large amounts to come are inaccurate. We will have, if  you like, “fat on our  bones” to the extent o f about $1 billion.

REYNOLDS:

OK. How many seats do you expect to win in Queensland?

H OW ARD:

I don’t  know.

REYNOLDS:

Quite a  few  presumably?

HOW ARD: Ã¢ÂÂ

Well I  hope so but this is a  very difficult, unpredictable election. 1 don’t know what the  outcome is going to be and I have said all along that it’s going to be tight. I think you could  have any result Anybody who thinks that it’s a  “lay down mi sere” for the Coalition is

deluding themselves. I f  people, when they go into vote have in their mind who is best able to  offer hope for young, unemployed Australians, I  believe we’tl win because we’re the only  people who’ve got a  plan for th a t I f  they think w e’re going to  help young families with  children, they’ll support us.

REYNOLDS:

I’ll put the same question to you as I put to the Prime Minister. Why should people give you  ago?

HOWARD:

The present Government’s been in power 13 years. We have an unacceptably high level o f  youth unemployment, we have the worst current account deficit in the western world. This  Government has had all the opportunities in the world to get things right and it hasn’t  Wc

arc offering a different way. We’re offering a  better way. Wc do offer better government  and wc have got some particular plans. W c want to regenerate small business so it can create  more jobs for young people, in particular and we have a modest, achievable, properly funded

family taxation package that will help case some o f the pressure on young families. They’re  two very powerful reasons why.

After a government’s been in 13 years and it’s developed all the signs o f arrogance and being  out o f touch that this Government has developed, that is all the more reason why an  alternative that’s got a plan in the two key areas should be given a go.

REYNOLDS:

Mr Howard, just before we go, how’s the foot this morning?

HOWARD:

Oh it’s still a  bit sore but life goes on and I'll be out on the campaign trail today.

REYNOLDS:

It’s not going to hamper your campaigning too much?

HOWARD:

It won’t stop me campaigning. I might walk a little more unevenly than usual - less evenly  than usual - but it’s certainly not going to keep me from maintaining all o f my commitments.

REYNOLDS:

All right M r Howard, thanks very much for your time.

HOWARD:

OK

(Ends)
