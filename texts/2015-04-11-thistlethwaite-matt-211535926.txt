E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS SATURDAY AGENDA  SATURDAY, 11 APRIL 2015

SUBJECT/S: Bishop travelling to Iran, Pensions.

DAVID LIPSON : We’ll start with asylum seekers do you believe that Iranians who  have failed in their asylum claims should be forcibly sent back to that country if some  sort of deal can be struck next week?

MATT THISTLETHWAITE, SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR  IMMIGRATION & FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Well David Australia has a clear set of  commitments that we’re signatory to under international conventions and that’s to  assess people who claim asylum in Australia in accordance with the convention and  Australian laws and immigration department guidelines and if a person is not found to  be a genuine refugee then the Government does have the opportunity to deport that  person subject to of course appeal mechanisms through the Australian administrative  system and court system so once all of those avenues have been exhausted, if  someone is not a genuine refugee then they can be deported and there were  circumstances under which that occurred under the previous Labor Government and  circumstances under which that occurs on a daily basis.

LIPSON: Is Iran the right country to be forcibly sending people back to? It’s a pretty  firm Government you could say.

THISTLETHWAITE: When these deportations do occur its preferable if they are done  in conjunction with the country and in agreement with the country from where a  particular asylum seeker may have come, but if that can’t be worked out then in other  circumstances its possible for arrangements to be reached with other nations for people  to be deported to other nations, it really does depend on the individual circumstances in  a lot of cases and whether or not Australia can negotiate a return arrangement with the  country of their origin or other nations.

LIPSON: Ok turning to the pension and the reports in the Financial Review today that  Joe Hockey is looking to split the health concession card from the pensions because  older, wealthier Australians are trying to arrange their finances so they can still get the  health card, the seniors health card, is that something Labor would consider  supporting?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well Paul Fletcher’s answer to your last question, the key for me  in his answer was he said that the Abbott Government had attempted to reduce the  rate of indexation of the pension, and that’s true and that says it all, that’s what the  Abbott Government was about, putting more pressure on pensioners by reducing the  rate of indexation of the pension over time that would see more pensioners slip into  poverty in Australia.

LIPSON: Sure but they haven’t succeeded there they are pushing on with other areas  now.

THISTLETHWAITE: Yes that’s right and the debate about pension with this  Government misses the mark, the level of the pension payment in Australia is  consistent with other OECD nations, the pressure that’s going to come on the pension is  from the increasing numbers who will access it because of the ageing of the population,  now the way to reduce that pressure is to ensure that more Australians are saving for  their own retirement through our compulsory superannuation system, and Labor’s  program was to increase the rate of compulsory superannuation over time to 12 per  cent, the Abbott Government when they came to office have frozen that increase…

LIPSON: Just on superannuation, since superannuation came in there hasn’t been a  big reduction in percentage terms of the number of Australians that actually claim the  aged pension so is Labor’s policy to sort of pump money into super without adjusting  the pensions is that actually going to change the number of people that are getting the  aged pension to pair that back at all to perhaps reverse some of the changes that John  Howard made in 2006, is it going to make an impact?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well you’re right and not enough Australians are saving fro their  own retirement, we’re not reducing the numbers of people who are claiming the  pension, that’s the reason why you need to increase the rate of compulsory savings  through superannuation increasing it from 9 to 12 per cent over time and it was a

staged increase over a period of time but you also need to make sure that more low  income people, the most vulnerable people in our community who are going to be  candidates for the pension, are at least saving for some of their retirement so instead of  accessing a full pension in the future they may only access a half pension and that was  what the low income superannuation contribution was aimed at, that’s been wiped out  by this Government, so you’ve had the increase in superannuation and the low income  superannuation contribution wiped out by the Abbott Government, that’s going to put  further pressure on the number of people accessing the pension over time and pressure  on the pension system so instead of talking about how we get more people onto more  compulsory retirement savings through superannuation the Abbott Government is about  reducing the amount that people will receive, pensioners will receive over time and  that’s unfair because it targets the most vulnerable and we’ll see more pensioners slip  into poverty and Labor won’t agree with that system.

LIPSON: Matt Thistlethwaite thanks so much for your time today.
