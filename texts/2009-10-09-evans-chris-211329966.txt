Minister announces new immigration advisory council

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today  announced the establishment of the Council for Immigration Services and  Status Resolution.

The council will provide independent advice on the implementation of  measures associated with the government’s immigration policy initiatives  including New Directions in Detention and the national rollout of the  Community Status Resolution Service.

‘The Government’s focus is on resolving the immigration status of people  quickly and fairly while ensuring they are treated humanely and with dignity  and respect,’ Senator Evans said.

‘The council will provide independent advice on policies, services and  programs to achieve timely, fair and effective resolution of immigration status  for people seeking asylum or other migration outcomes in Australia.

‘The terms of reference and membership of the council reflects the range of  expertise required to implement the Government’s New Directions in  Detention policy.’

The council, which succeeds the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, will  meet for the first time on October 21 to identify priority issues to be addressed  over the next two years. The IDAG provided valuable advice on the adequacy  of detention services, accommodation and facilities at immigration detention  centres around Australia.

The new council will also advise on the suitability of facilities and service  delivery arrangements but its major focus will be on assisting the department  with strategies to resolve a person’s immigration status in a community setting  rather than in a detention centre provided they pose no risk to the community.

The council will be chaired by Paris Aristotle AM, director of the Victorian  Foundation for Survivors of Torture and a former member of Immigration  Detention Advisory Group with more than 25 years’ experience in the field.
