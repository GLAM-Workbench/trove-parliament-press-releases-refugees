PW 333/09 15 November 2009  TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC1 INSIDERS WITH BARRIE CASSIDY  SUBJECT: AGRICULTURE, CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME, CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS TO AUSTRALIA’S COAST, TRAVESTON DAM, OCEANIC VIKING  E & O E - PROOF ONLY  JOURNALIST: We’re joined this morning by Senator Penny Wong. Good morning and welcome.  WONG: Good morning Barrie.  JOURNALIST: Time for talk is almost over as I said. Are you anymore hopeful now of the support of the Coalition than you were when you first started negotiations with Ian Macfarlane?  WONG: Well there is still a bit of talking to do. But as you know we are moving forward. It has been a very constructive process, these negotiations. We’re moving forward, we are absolutely committed on this side of the table to doing what we are able to do to get a deal. That is why we have announced this offer on agriculture. That is why we will continue to move forward in those negotiations because this is in Australia’s national interest. We need to get this reform through.  JOURNALIST: And that is a big concession. Is it the deal breaker, the agreement on agriculture?  WONG: Well there was a long list put forward by the Opposition. Certainly they have said publicly, Ian Macfarlane said publicly, that agriculture was something they had to have. There’s obviously other things on their list. We have said to them - economically responsible, environmentally effective. They are the tests we’ll apply. But in terms of agriculture, this is an offer that is made by the Government on an issue that we know is important to the Opposition because we are serious about getting this legislation through.  JOURNALIST:  And you’re also allowing farmers, as I understand it, to benefit by generating carbon credits. Why weren’t you on that page months ago?  WONG:  Just on this issue - we agree with the National Farmers’ Federation on this, that excluding agriculture doesn’t mean that farmers can’t be part of the solution. We have to work through how that will be the case. Where we were a few months ago was that we needed to do more research and that we wanted to review this issue in 2013. The Opposition put to us that they wanted more certainty than that, they wanted specific exclusion in the legislation and we are saying today that we are prepared to do that in the interest, in the national interest, of getting up the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, getting that through the Parliament. This is an offer we are prepared to make.  JOURNALIST: What do you say though to the people who want a tougher scheme? That a very large contributor now - that is farming - to greenhouse gas emissions will be excluded.

WONG: Well I think we look to what the NFF has said - the National Farmers’ Federation have  said - that exclusion of agriculture from the scheme he doesn’t mean that farmers can’t be part of  the solution. There are a range of ways that that can occur. We are interested in continuing the  discussion with the Coalition about how we do that.

JOURNALIST:  Now overnight the APEC leaders backed away from a fixed target for halving  emissions. That target was in the initial draft according to the Chinese. It’s not there anymore. Is  that an ominous sign?

WONG:  Look there’s a lot of discussion about targets and communiquÃÂ©s and declarations - I’ve  been part of negotiating a few of them this year. The key issue is the two degree target, that is  trying to hold global temperatures to two degrees. From that flows a whole range of demands on  developed and developing economies. That was included in the Major Economies Forum  declaration earlier this year. And I think that’s the key way of looking at this - what is the  temperature rise that we want to try and achieve?

JOURNALIST: But you need to achieve that by halving or at least making significant inroads into  emissions. And whenever gatherings like this get together what seems to happen is that the political  will disappears.

WONG: Well our political will is there. We have said we will move to a 60 per cent reduction by  2050, and the Prime Minister has made clear that he is prepared to go to an election for a greater  target if that is required. Our political will is clear - but the key issue here is not what is happening  in 2050, the key issue here is what is happening in the next two weeks. We have got the opportunity  to pass, for the first time, legislation that actually reduces Australia’s contribution to climate  change. That is what is on offer here; that is why we have got to get on with doing. The time to pass  this legislation is now.

JOURNALIST:  But again the target seems to be the problem. In your separate negotiations with  the Greens, you have excluded any discussion of emissions reduction targets. Why did you do that?  Why did you put restrictions on your discussions with the Greens?

WONG: Well what I have said publicly is we think the targets that we have put on the table are  both ambitious and credible and they are also achievable. And those are the targets that have been  agreed to by the Opposition. Those are the targets that have been negotiated and agreed to through  the discussion the Government had with the community, the environmental groups and the business  community leading up to the announcement earlier this year. Up to 25 per cent reduction by 2020 -  that is a very significant reduction. Obviously that is not all we have to do. We have to go further  than that. But we’ve got to get on with it. I mean, we keep talking about 2020, 2050 - I’m worried  about this year and next year and the year after. I’m worried about giving business the certainty that  is required for the investment that is needed for this transformation. Just this week Barrie, we had  the International Energy Agency estimating that each year of delay will cost the globe about  US$500 billion more to make the transformation. $500 billion is what they have put the figure at. I  mean that just demonstrates the longer you delay, the higher the cost. It’s the same advice Peter  Shergold gave John Howard. He said the advice was ‘go soon because if you don’t it will cost you  more’. Let’s get on with it. The time for action is now.

JOURNALIST: And you say the time for action is now, but can you understand the frustrations  from the Greens and those who support the Greens’ position - that you will negotiate with the  Coalition to weaken the scheme, but you won’t seriously negotiate with the Greens to strengthen  the scheme.

WONG: Well we are willing to have a dialogue with the Greens. I’d remind you that the Greens  voted with Barnaby Joyce and Senator Fielding when this was last before the Parliament. Now  that’s a matter for them, they are entitled to do that. We are willing to have dialogue with the  Greens, but ultimately the Government has to get this legislation through if we actually want to  effect change. A theoretical bill sitting on the table doesn’t actually do anything to reduce climate  change. And we either have to get the Greens plus Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon or we  have to get the Opposition. And the judgment that the Government has made is that we need to get  into dialogue with the Opposition. We are obviously prepared to have a discussion with the Greens  but ultimately the Senate means - the way the Senate is configured - we need to get a majority of  Senators to support this legislation. Malcolm Turnbull still has the majority of Senators in the  Senate.

JOURNALIST: The Greens released, polled some research overnight, that they says 35 per cent  that support the Government’s position, but 54 per cent want tougher action as outlined by the  Greens. Do you accept that might be a true position?

WONG:  You know Barrie, in this job, I’ve been given lots of modelling by lots of people who pay  for it. I’ve been showed lots of polling by lots of people who have paid for it. Our view is we’ve got  to do what we think is right. People might not agree with the decisions I’ve made as Minister, that  the Government has made. But I can say this to you: we have always tried to do what we think is in  the national interest and what we need to do to get the support of the Parliament. That is how we are  approaching this. We think it is absolutely in Australia’s national interest to act. We have had a lot  of debate in this country over a decade. The time to actually do something is now. And in the next  two weeks we have got the opportunity to do it.

JOURNALIST: There were some interesting figures released on rising sea levels, speaking of  research. Not so long ago you released a report suggesting sea levels would rise by 79cm by the end  of the century. Now we have another one on the eve of the vote suggesting it could rise by 1.1  metres. Which one are we supposed to believe?

WONG: The 79cm was the upper end of the IPCC scenario which was based on the science as it  was to 2007. The reason the Government chose, with the advice of experts and the Department, to  model a 1.1 metre, is that the science has moved on. It is comparable with the sorts of estimates that  other countries such as the US, the UK, Netherlands and New Zealand have put in place. This is  about the upper end of the risk. What we are saying is in terms of the long-term planning decisions  that we are making, the locking in of infrastructure, the planning land use decisions that we are  making that have very long time frames, we do need to have information that shows us the broad  range of risks. And 1.1 metres is the upper end that was chosen. Obviously this is the beginning of a  discussion, a dialogue with different levels of government and the community. We need a strategy  that is going to go forward in the years ahead. But the first thing we need is the information. And  that is why the Government did this - what we call a first pass assessment, a vulnerability  assessment - that gives us a better sense of the risk.

JOURNALIST:  But it is, as you say, the upper-end of predictions and it assumes, in effect, that  Governments do nothing for the next 100 years around the world and that is not going to happen.  So to that extent it is alarmist, isn’t it?

WONG: Barrie, you just actually talked to me about the lack of political will earlier in a question  but I hope on that you are wrong then and right now. That governments have the political will to  act. Now we’re not at all trying to do anything other than to put information into the public arena.  As I said yesterday - if we knew this, if this information were provided and the Government just sat  on it, I think you would be saying to me, Minister isn’t it irresponsible for you not to release it?

We’re saying here is an analysis, we need to do lots more work. We need to work with local  government, state governments, we have to work through this and get a much better framework for  managing the coastal vulnerability that climate change imposes.

JOURNALIST: But if 240,000 homes are genuinely at risk of inundation, of going under, then  surely given those dire predictions that is a good argument to embrace the Greens’ position to do  more than what the Government is actually suggesting.

WONG: I think it’s a good argument to act. I think the thing we keep forgetting is that the longer  we delay the higher the risk, the higher the cost. As I said, we can have a discussion Barrie, you and  I, about theoretical targets. Ultimately what matters is how much we actually reduce emissions - by  how much we actually reduce Australia’s carbon pollution. And we’re only going to do that if we  pass legislation that actually sets a cap that starts to reduce.

JOURNALIST: The decision taken this week to block the Traveston dam in south-east  Queensland - in the end, what mattered most to the Government? Was it the environmental  consequences or, in the view of the government, there were better options available?

WONG: Well Barrie that is a decision that Peter Garrett makes as Environment Minister under  legislation. He has a statutory discretion. He is entitled to exercise that in accordance with law as he  sees fit. He exercises his discretion in terms of the decisions under that legislation. That is a  decision for him. Obviously it is a decision that Queensland has made their views clear about. I’ve  certainly had some discussion with my Queensland counterpart about consequences. We will work  through those in terms of the water portfolio but ultimately this is a decision for Peter Garrett.

JOURNALIST: But Anna Bligh, the Queensland Premier, made the point that this is not pristine  country. And if you block a dam there, it’s hard to see this Government approving a dam anywhere  in the country.

WONG: Well people are entitled to express their opinion. This is legislation that has been in place  for some time. In fact, it was introduced under the Howard Government. And it gives the  Environment Minister discretion which he has to exercise as he sees fit. And Peter has done that.

JOURNALIST:  But do you think this Government - the Federal Government, Peter Garrett - is  capable of approving a dam anywhere?

WONG: I think Peter Garrett is perfectly capable of making the decision he believes right in the  circumstances. And that is what he has done on this occasion as he has on previous occasions in  relation to other projects.

JOURNALIST: Well it’s going to cost the Queensland taxpayers a whole lot more money, at least  according to the Premier. Will the Federal Government chip in? Do you take the view that  supplying water to south-east Queensland is purely a Queensland responsibility?

WONG: Well as I said earlier, I have had some discussions with Stephen Robertson when I was in  Queensland on Friday for a Murray-Darling Ministerial Council. There are obviously consequences  for Queensland in terms of how they now manage attaining water security. They are obviously  going to have to reconsider what their plan into the future is. As the Federal Government we made  clear we do believe we have a role in assisting states to ensure urban water security. That is why we  have funded stormwater projects, we have funded desalination plants. We have an urban water  fund. We’re certainly willing to have this discussion with Queensland.

JOURNALIST: So they can come back to you with some prospect of winning support for  desalination, for example?

WONG: What I said was is that we are certainly willing to have this dialogue with Queensland,  Barrie. We understand that there are some pressing water issues for that state, particularly with  population growth, so that’s obviously an issue we are prepared to have a discussion about.

JOURNALIST: OK and just finally, it’s not in your portfolio responsibility, but hopefully you  have been briefed on this. On the Oceanic Viking, 22 asylum seekers now have left the boat. What  do you understand are the prospects of others following them?

WONG: Well it isn’t my portfolio as you have said. I am aware of the 22 who have left the boat.  There are some reports of others being willing to leave. This is an ongoing situation. Obviously, the  Australian Government’s view is we are prepared to operate patiently, wait patiently, but we are  keen to see this matter resolved. And people are working through it on the ground.

JOURNALIST: Senator Penny Wong, thanks for your time this morning.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
