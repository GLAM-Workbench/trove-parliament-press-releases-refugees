KIERAN GILBERT:

This is PM Agenda, thanks for your company. Now to the Coalition’s latest and final  plank of its border protection policy which was announced earlier today by the Shadow  Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison.  I spoke to Mr Morrison shortly afterwards. Now  you’ve announced you’re going to end legal aid for asylum seekers, government funded  legal aid that is, if you win the upcoming election. What information will be provided to  asylum seekers under your plan?



SCOTT MORRISON:

Well, first I should stress it’s immigration advice, there are legal components to it but this  advice is provided by people other than just lawyers under the system. What will be  provided is in language kits which set out very clearly what the process is and if people  have questions about that, then interpreters will continue to be available to assist people  get that information. But what won’t be done is there won’t be assistance in preparing

cases and if people seek to have a review of their negative decisions, then assistance with  preparing their cases to appeal those negative decisions. So this cost saving will be  around about $100 million over the budget and forward estimates, and we think  particularly in a budget environment like this that the idea of continuing to spend $100  million on these types of services is not one that the Coalition believes is a priority and  frankly, is going well above and beyond what our obligations are on these issues.

GILBERT:

What are Australia’s obligations under the Refugees Convention and more broadly  international conventions when it comes to providing support to asylum seekers that  arrive here?

MORRISON:

Well to do exactly what I have said we will do and to provide a process to...

GILBERT:

Is that the bare minimum?

MORRISON:

Yes, to provide a process by which a person’s assessment can be undertaken, and so what  we are talking about here is the process that’s followed in many countries around the  world, it’s certainly the process that will be followed up in Indonesia and Malaysia.

GILBERT:

Is this the bare minimum?

MORRISON:

Look, I think it is a programme that enables people to have their case heard and they will  have that programme explained to them in their own language. The current assistance that  is provided under this programme isn’t provided to people who actually arrive legally in  the country and make asylum claims. So this is a system currently which goes well above  and beyond, and at a price of $100 million. If Labor think that that is a priority for public  expenditure, $100 million on providing migration assistance to people who’ve arrived  illegally by boat, well they should make that case. The Coalition doesn’t believe that is a  priority for expenditure.



GILBERT:

Refugee advocate Julian Burnside says for a person without representation to go to the  Refugee Review tribunal, they’re likely to end up in an unfair result if they don’t know  what they are doing. The result of that will be that a number of people who are genuine

refugees will be returned to face persecution because they haven’t had a fair go in our  system.

MORRISON:

Well they will get a fair go and if Julian Burnside wishes to provide his advice pro bono,  which I know he does, and I’m sure there will be many who will do that and we’re not  stopping access to people getting that advice or assistance, we are just saying the  taxpayer won’t be on the hook for it.

GILBERT:

So it’s only a fair go if someone’s willing to provide support or advice free?  Pro bono?

MORRISON:

Well I’m sure there are many groups that will seek to do just that.

GILBERT:

But if they don’t, it’s not a fair go.

MORRISON:

Well I disagree with you, we are doing what is the obligation that we have and we don’t  think spending $100 million above and beyond that, Kieran, is frankly a fair go for  Australian taxpayers.  And that’s the fair go I’m most interested in.

GILBERT:

Are you worried that refugees could be sent back to countries and face persecution, more  likely to face that prospect under this plan?

MORRISON:

No, I’m not because I’m confident in the competency and professionalism of the  assessors within our Department and others who’d be undertaking those assessments to  get to the truth of the case and to understand whether Australia owes them  protection. That’s what the assessment system is designed to do, it’s not supposed to be  an adversarial system as exists within our courts, this is an administrative process as we  would run it where people are seeking to find out the truth of a person’s claim and that’s  what I would be instructing our assessors to do and we just don’t think having taxpayer  funded migration advice being thrown into that mix is the best use of public funds,  particularly in a budget situation like we have today.

GILBERT:

But the problem is don’t they get it wrong a lot of the time?  Isn’t it upwards of 50 per  cent where people go to the Refugee Review tribunal and have their decision by the  assessors that you referred to overturned?



MORRISON:

Well I’m not sure whether that says that the appeals system or the initial decision is  wrong, Kieran.  I think Labor’s been running a tick and flick system for ages now and it’s  a system which is designed to generate yes’s and that of course has a significant impact  on Australia’s programme as well. I mean the other thing, as you know, we announced  some weeks ago was that under our programme not one person who comes by boat will  take the visa of someone who is waiting offshore. Now, under Labor’s programme, that  will continue. We have broken that nexus if we are elected, for all time, and I think that is  an important reform.  I’m surprised Labor have rejected that idea but that’s for them to  explain. They want to continue handing visas out to people who arrive by boat and taking  them from people who are waiting offshore and they want to continue shovelling money  into taxpayer funded schemes like this while they’re prepared to make cuts in other  places.

GILBERT:

Do you think there’s likely to be an influx of refugees around the world over the next  year given the humanitarian crisis in Syria?

MORRISON:

Well I think it’s important to have a humanitarian programme that is able to cope with  that and to be able to take people in the right way and not have it happen the wrong way  as has occurred under this government.  Because when people come the wrong way and  their claims, frankly, you have the question in cases as our own Foreign Minister, Bob  Carr has questioned.  I mean we want people who need our help to get our help and we  want that to be decided by the Australian Government, not by people smugglers and a  tick and flick system this government has been operating for the last many years.

GILBERT:

But your sense is that we will face a greater international refugee challenge over the next  year given that disaster unfolding in Syria?

MORRISON:

Well not just in Syria but in Egypt as well, you’d be familiar with the situation there.  I  think there are a number of these cases which is going to have a call on our Special  Humanitarian programme and our refugee programme, and under the Coalition system I  can guarantee you there are 13,750 places that we can commit towards that task.

GILBERT:

Ok.

MORRISON:

The government cannot do that because they’re still pulling visas out of that programme  that go to people on boats and that’s what we’ll end, along with the taxpayer funded  assistance for these claims and their appeals.

GILBERT:

Just finally, you and I have discussed many times, you’ve said there’s two challenges,  one is stopping the boats, one is clearing the number that are already in the system.  Is  this more about clearing part of that number?

MORRISON:

Well it is, and that’s the context in which I announced it today, whether it has a further  impact on the other challenge, well we will wait and see.  And as we’ve said in the  policy, we would be seeking to mirror this arrangement in our offshore processing  jurisdictions, subject to having discussions with our partners who have the sovereignty  over those places.

GILBERT:

Scott Morrison, thanks for your time.

MORRISON:

Thanks, Kieran.
