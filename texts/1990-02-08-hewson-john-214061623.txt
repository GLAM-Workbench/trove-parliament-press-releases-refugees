TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE

MELBOURNE, 8 FEBRUARY 1990

JRNLST: Dr Hewson, have you gol any comments on today's employment  numbers?

HEWSON :

JRNLST :

Well, It's mounting evidence that the economy is moving  into stagflation. A week or so ago we got accelerating  inflation numbers, now we've got rising unemployment,  the economy is flattening out, flattening out very fast, .   we're seeing almost every day another example of the

corporate failure or hearing of another personal bankruptcy  or personal financial difficulty. It's a period of  stagflation.

Do you think it provides increasing evidence for a further  easing of monetary policy?

HEWSON:

JRNLSTi

The markets seem to have reacted to today's decision  with that expectation in the sense that I gather there's  been some downward pressure in the exchange rate. I  gather the Reserve Bank has been in there intervening

quite heavily to hold it up. I expect that the Treasurer  will probably still continue to force the pace and we  remain concerned that any interest rate reductions arc-  unsustainable in the sense that unless he puts policies

in place to validate lower Interest rates they won't  be sustained. The two previous elections he's put interest  rates down 3-4 months before the election and within  a year they've been back up on an upward course after

the election.

You said today you were looking for a more independent  Reserve Bank. Why's that?

H E W S O N !

The issue of Reserve Bank independence is important because it  should be free to pursue its main objective which is

the control of inflation and we have been concerned that

it hasn't been as independent as it ought to have been

on a number of occasions over the last several years. To us, it's important that it effectively goes orÂ· be  free to play that role. As I said today, it's not just

the Reserve B a n k , it's all the other elements of the

policy package that will get inflation down.

Are you concerned by the Reserve Bank's intervention  in keeping the dollar up?

Well, I've never been a great supporter of sustained  intervention. I understand the argements for intervention  within a trend if you like but not to try and break a

trend or prevent a trend. The thing that hi a a concerned

us about the exchange rate is that .it was pushed up and

up and up as the Government put interest rates higher

and hiigher and higher and that in itself compounded boLhi  our inflation problem and our. balance of payments problem,  tor example it made imports cheaper and the higher interest  rates fed straight into the CPI which put the inflation

rate up. It was a misguided policy. Reversing the policy

however, which he's trying to do now which is to put

interest rates d o w n ,  risks in a very serious way a free

fall of the Australian dollar. I'm concerned at that

risk and I'd like to see him put some policies in place

that we could actually get sustainable reductions in  interest rates.

Dr Hewson on a separate issue there are reports this

morning that Coalition Government might introduce taxes  and charges to help environmental pollution. Do you  agree with that approach? -

it was an announcement I think made sometime ago in an

environment policy paper the name of which I'm not sure

- Millenium Milestones perhaps was the piece - and I'm .

happy to look at all those proposals, .

Even though Increased taxes are to be inflationary?

You're drawing conclusions without seeing the specific  proposal. I think it's better that Chris Higgins puts

ills own arguments and his own views on that issue. As

far as I'm concerned, sorry, Chris Puplick puts his own

views on the issue but to me the environment is going

to be one of the major issues in this campaign.

Can Australia's 800 Local Governments look forward to  an Increase in funding under a Coalition Government?

I'm riot going to announce that now. I d o n ’t in saying

that want to create expectations one way or the otherÂ·.  Shadow Minister Bronwyn Bishop has indicated that an  announcement will be made before the election and we'll  let that process take its c o u r s e .

Would you legislate to prevent intervention with the  Reserve Bank?

Not .  int e r v e n t i o n ,  no. What we're concerned about in  terms of the Reserve Bank Act is legislating to ensure

enhanced i n d e p e n d e n c e ,  not In saying that drawing any  conclusions or implying any link with their current  intervention foreign exchange (inaudible )  .  .

So do you have a specific plan to introduce legislation

to ensure that independence?

We have talked In general terms about the sort of changes

we think would need to be made and we've admitted that

some of those changes would probably require an amendment  to the Reserve Bank A c t .  We haven't put down any specific

proposals as yet. I welcome what is obviously an increase

in public debate about the issue and I've seen a number'

of articles where other suggestions have been m a d e . In Government we will decide precisely what we do. I

have in the past thought Lire Act provided sufficient  independence but in observing the reality of the last

seven years it hasn't and that's why we are prepared

to investigate the possibility of amending ,  the Reserve  Bank Act. '

Has the Opposition yet decided where it would make funding  cuts to find the extra money for roads, local government

and (inaudible)?

What we've said is that if we announce anything between

Lire date of our Economic Action Plan's release last October  and the election campaign and particularly in the context  of an election speech then we will tell you if it involves

increased expenditure for example we will tell you how  we're going to fund t h a t .  .  We've obviously been working  on the election speech and you've got to give us a break.

We'd like to bring it down in the context of the election

c a m p a i g n .  If there is increased road funding or anything

else we'll explain at the same time where the money comes

HEWSON:

Dr Hewson,  local governments have been complaining about  real cuts in funding over the last few years.  Do you  think there's a good case in principle under a Coalition  Government irrespective of funding arrangements to index  payments to local governments?

I'm not going to be drawn into talking about the specifics  of our decision on local government. As I said we will  announce in due course what our position is. The Shadow  Minister has given a very clear statement of the direction

in which we are going. We might be given the flexibility  and freedom to determine when we make that announcement.

Can you give me an example of where there has been  intervention with the Reserve Bank?

I think you're using intervention in a different sense. If you're talking about where there's been the wrong  sort of relationship between the Government and the  Reserve Bank the best example was the interest rate deal  that was down in the last quarter of last year to hold  down the mortgage rates of the four big banks, I don't

think the Reserve Bank should have been involved in  broking,that deal between the Government and the banks  at all. That's not to say that i don't want lower  interest rates. We certainly do but there are policy

alternatives that will give you lower interest rates. We're not interested in cosmetic solutions. We're not  interested in that sort of deal. We think it's the .

wrong way to go. That to me is just totally inappropriate

Dr Hewson could you just recap on the Board changes -   you would envisage at the Reserve Bank.

We have floated some ideas for discussion rather than  being specific policy proposals but one element of the  issue of independence is the role of the Reserve Bank  Bank Board. In particular we have identified the

possibility of adding executive directors to that Board.  Presently now you have the Governor and the Deputy  Governor I believe and a number of non-executive directors  I think there's one avenue that's worth investigating is  adding a number of executive directors tb. that Board who  would be full time. They'd be a member of the Board and

also work on a full time basis in the bank.. Another  possibility is to make the Chairman's job an Executive  Chairman. Another possibility is to remove the Secretary  of Treasury from the Reserve Bank Board ensuring

independence between the Reserve Bank and the Treasury  in that political process. As I say they're not firm  proposals they are some of a number of ideas that we're  looking at that have been put to us that we've floated  publicly for discussion. I'd like to see a nice healthy  debate about this because I know it's not just us in

HEWSON:

Opposition that have reservations about the role of the  Reserve Bank. You can go out anywhere in financial  markets and talk about the role that was played, y o u  can  go overseas and see how they assess the role that was

played by the Reserve Bank in the mortgage deal last year.  They're very real issues - we need a healthy public  debate about them.

Dr Hewson in the second and third years of a Coalition  Government in principle would that Coalition Government  try to maintain a healthy budget surplus?

We're not going to say anything more than we've said  about years two and three. I don't think that's  unreasonable in the sense that we've put down the detail  of our year one budget and the Government has yet to put  down any detail of its year one budget. Indeed, it  hasn't given us the detail of how they're going to  pay for the six'ior seven hundred million dollars of

increased expenditure that Bob Hawke has embarked on  in recent months on a spending spree just since the  last budget. What 1 will say to you is that we have  the intention of .'maintaining the direction we've  identified for the fiscal policy, In particular we  are very keen to maintain expenditure restraint, We've  put the discipline on ourselves to do that which is that  we will hand back bracket creep on an annual basis to

taxpayers so that the Government won't be able to bloat  itself from one year to the next because of the increased  inflation. And that's a very real fiscal discipline  again. It’s not a discipline the.Government1s prepared  to accept.

Keating has said the budget' surplus is not immutable  foreshadowing a lower surplus because of the tax cuts. Do you think that's appropriate?

Our view about the elements of the emerging wage deal is  one of concern. We want people to have higher wages but  we want them to be validated really by productivity  increases. We want people to have tax cuts but we want

them to be funded by cuts in Government expenditure. Now  if the Government comes out with a wage deal that just  gives wage increases across the board that are unrelated  to productivity and just gives tax cuts that are not

funded by cuts in Government expenditure then its economic  madness. In current circumstances it is a significant  easing of fiscal policy, it's a significant easing of  wages policy on top of a significant easing of monetary

policy when the exchange rate is under downward pressure  and inflation is still accelerating, That's our view. We would like to see the Government put its clear position  on the record on that issue. Now as to the size of the

surplus well the Treasurer plays games with the surplus.

ENDS.

FOR FURTHER

He talks about fiscal policy being a rock orv which his  whole policy structure is founded. But then he says of  course, I can chip away at the rock and the whole house  of cards isn't going to fall down,  well nobody believes

it. Ã¢ÂÂ

In those circumstances and looking at Australia's high  debt levels and the need to repay that debt don't you  think it's a good idea to maintain a healthy budget  surplus for years to come.

I'll answer your question in respect of our first year in  Government where we have identified a surplus of, from  memory, nearly 10.8 or 11 billion dollars.  That is  including the proceeds of asset sales, including our  privatisation receipts from the first year which is

significantly more obviously than the Government has in  mind currently or prospectively for the size of the  surplus in that first year in Government. We've committed  the proceeds of asset sales to debt retirement and so I

take your point we will use the surplus in that first year  to accelerate the process of debt retirement which is  fundamentally important.
