JON FAINE: Bill Shorten, good morning to you.

BILL SHORTEN: Good morning, Jon.

FAINE: What’s triggered this from the Prime Minister?

SHORTEN: Well I think he was answering a question at a debate. I think Kevin  Rudd took a very front-foot approach in the debate. I mean, all of the issues in  the debate, not just the foreign investment issue, I think we saw Tony Abbott  trying to take a small target approach. They know they’re ahead in the polls. He  desperately doesn’t want to put his foot in his mouth; that’s why he’s keeping his  mouth shut.

Kevin Rudd, by contrast, knows that nothing ventured is nothing gained. He  addresses the issues the community is raising, and foreign investment is one of  them.

FAINE: Tony Abbott said that he would reduce the threshold for the Foreign  Investment Review Board, which at the moment - he says it would go down to  $15 million - it’s up over $200 million. So it’s really only mega deals that at the  moment get supervised. Is your polling telling you that this is an issue where you  can maybe make some inroads?

SHORTEN: No, I think the issue about foreign investment is always a hot button  issue, especially when it comes to land, water rights and agribusinesses. The  way the current foreign investment review structure works in Australia - deals  beyond a certain deal have to go before the Foreign Investment Review Board

for approval. The debate is do you lower the threshold to study foreign deals. I  think you need to address this discussion, which is an important discussion, with  two principles. One is, there is community anxiety on whether Australians still  own Australia. But you balance against that the fact that trade is a part of - we’re  an island nation, and trading with the rest of the world and competing with the  rest of the world is the key to our prosperity.

FAINE: Sure, but your attitude on this is different whether you’re a seller or a  neighbour, isn’t it?

SHORTEN: Well, not necessarily.

FAINE: Well if you’re selling, and you want to get the best price that you can, you  don’t care who’s offering, if someone from overseas is -

SHORTEN: But if you’re a neighbour and you’re in a regional town and you know  you’re going to have an investor who’s going to invest in jobs and invest in  renewed infrastructure, then chances are a rising tide lifts all boats. I’m in the  western suburbs of Melbourne, and Qenos is a large industrial manufacturer. It  used to be owned by, I think, Esso or BHP and [indistinct], anyway, a couple of  those companies. It was going backwards because there was no reinvestment in  capital. A Chinese company came along and bought it. And at one level, you go,  oh well, Chinese company buying an Australian manufacturer, is that a change  we don’t like.

The reality is that company has invested in both the Altona plant and the Botany  plant and its saved jobs. So there’s always two sides to every coin. And what the  Prime Minister articulated last night, though, is a respect for community concern.  And the way you deal with community concern is you have all the facts on the  table.

FAINE: Sure, and I remember talking to you about this topic when it was one of  your portfolio responsibilities in your earlier Ministerial incarnation as - what was  it - Minister for Finance, I think it was called?

SHORTEN: Assistant Treasurer, yeah.

FAINE: Assistant Treasurer, thank you. And you in fact told us there was no  need for any changes, that you’d done an audit of foreign investment in  Australian agricultural land, and there was hardly any activity worthy of note.

SHORTEN: No, what I said to you is that concerns that Australians don’t own  Australia anymore are overblown.

FAINE: So, what - the Prime Minister’s concerns are overblown?

SHORTEN: No, what he said is there are concerns in the community. What I  would say, also, though, and I’m sure I said it then, and if I didn’t say it then it  was what I was thinking, is if you want to have a scientific, facts-based debate  about the balance between Australians controlling Australia and attracting foreign  investment, then you need to have as much transparency as possible. And since  then, Labor has articulated the need for a register. So at least we know who  owns what, where. And Labor’s the party that’s driven that in both residential  property, and again our record’s good because we’re driving that in agricultural  property, too.

FAINE: But neither Tony Abbott nor Kevin Rudd referred to that last night. And in  fact, this was, I suspect, a straight play to the same marginal seat swinging  voters that so many other, for instance, anti-refugee policies are. And it’s thinly  disguised xenophobia, or even, at its worst, maybe racism, Mr Shorten.

SHORTEN: Oh Jon, it is not racist of Australians to want to know who owns their  land. So I respect that debate. I think the best way you have informed public  policy is that we avoid the slogans and we get on with the facts.

FAINE: Are we as concerned about Canadian investors in agricultural land as we  would be about Chinese investors in agricultural land? Or does it all - is it all  different if it’s Canadians, or French?

SHORTEN: No, it isn’t. I mean for me, what concerns me is are people, when  they’re investing in Australia, when they bring with them capital investment, are  they creating jobs. For me, what matters is the creation and maintenance of good  paying jobs in this country. Obviously, I think it is important that as the Prime  Minister articulated we’re interested in promoting Australian investment and  Australian ownership. The world - a little known fact, Australians own as much of  the rest of the world as the rest of the world owns of Australia. So we engage  with, we live in a global world. But what we’ve also got to do is make sure that we  do know who owns what, we do, I think, we are interested to make sure that  Australians control Australian enterprises, Australian agribusinesses, Australian  water rights.

So, I think it’s a legitimate concern, who owns what. I don’t think it’s xenophobic  or racist. On the other hand, we - the best thing we can do to combat racism and  xenophobia, which is what’s worrying you, is by having the clearest set of facts,  so people can realise okay, there is a bit of give and take in foreign investment in  Australia, but it’s not at the point where Australians no longer own their land.

FAINE: Alright, just finally, I know you have to catch a plane - briefly. What’s the  announcement the Prime Minister’s making at Williamstown dockyards today?

SHORTEN: The Australian Labor Party supports the ship construction industry in  this country. There’s sectors of the Australian economy where it just prudent to

have a strong Australian manufacturing base. We are an island. We should be a  nation that builds ships here. So what the Prime Minister’s saying is that he  would bring forward the building of two supply ships - these are big ships - so  that we can avoid the peaks and troughs which often happen in Australian  manufacturing. By peaks and troughs, what I mean is, you may get a big order  for building ships or submarines or trains -

FAINE: You’ve got to have continuity. Understood.

SHORTEN: You keep the boilermakers, you keep the apprentices - I used to, in  my old work, go down to the dockyards in Williamstown. We’ve been building  ships here since before the Gold Rush. They were wooden ships then. Now  they’re ships of steel. We need to keep those jobs. They’re good jobs. And one  thing’s for sure -

FAINE: So why criticise Tony Abbott for putting some money into a chocolate  factory in Tasmania, that’s one of the few employers in Tasmania, when you’re  doing the same thing to keep jobs in Williamstown?

SHORTEN: Well, what I’m talking about is ships. Ships are pretty big enterprises.  We need to make sure that we keep those core skills. Because the tradespeople,  the trades’ assistants, the painters, people who work as shipbuilders, they have  skills which, frankly, generate apprenticeships and small business.

If you want to vote for manufacturing in this country, you should vote Labor at this  election, because we’re the ones who are supporting with policies which are  sensible to make sure that we have a viable manufacturing industry. And an  island nation to keep building ships. So if you think building ships is important, I’d  vote Labor at this election, Jon.

FAINE: Thank you for your time this morning.
