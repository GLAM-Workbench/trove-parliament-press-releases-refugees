E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks for doing the second media conference today. I’m very pleased to be here with the Shadow Minister  for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, with the Shadow Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison, to report on  the meeting that we have just had with President Stephen of Nauru and two of his parliamentary colleagues.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss with the Nauruan President the willingness of his country to re-open the Australian-built and Australian-funded asylum seeker processing centre which operated  successfully on Nauru between 2001 and 2008 and which was such an important part of the policies of the  former Government to stop the boats, the successful policies of the former Government to stop the boats.

It was absolutely crystal clear from the discussions that we had with the Nauruan team that Nauru is ready,  willing and able to re-open that processing centre at short notice. It’s also crystal clear that under the  Nauruan Constitution, there is no impediment whatsoever to the Nauruan Government re-opening that centre  immediately, to making the decision to reopen that centre immediately.

Now, the most important conversation that Julia Gillard could have had in Brisbane today was with the  President of Nauru and it’s a real pity that she hasn’t today had, here in Brisbane, that conversation with the  President of Nauru and I simply point out that today in Brisbane, Julia Gillard has been having meetings  with Mark, not with Mark Latham, with Kevin Rudd. Julia Gillard has been meeting with Kevin Rudd to  talk about Labor’s problems. I have been meeting with the President of Nauru to address the issues facing  our country. So, I might just ask Julie to say a few words and then Scott to say a few words. I should point  out that Scott will actually be travelling to Nauru tomorrow night because it’s very important that we see for  ourselves the conditions on Nauru. We’re confident that they are good based on the discussions that we’ve  had today with the Nauruan team but it is important that we see for ourselves and that’s what Scott will be  doing in coming days.

JULIE BISHOP:

Thank you Tony and Scott. The President of Nauru made it plain to day that he was available to speak to  both sides of politics. We took up that opportunity because we believe that there is a solution that we can  achieve, working with the Nauruan Government. He also made it clear that there is support within the

community in Nauru, both parliamentary and amongst the people, for the re-opening of the Australian-built  and Australian taxpayer-funded processing centre and that again, I reiterate, there is no impediment to the  decision being made by the Government of Nauru to negotiate with Australia to  open the centre. Our  relationship with Nauru is strong and we have taken this opportunity to find out from the President the  current status in Nauru and he’s confirmed that the country is willing, ready, able to re-open that centre.

SCOTT MORRISON:

Thank you Tony. As Tony said I’m looking forward to taking the opportunity to go to Nauru tomorrow  evening and visit there on Monday and take a first hand look at the facilities, as well as addressing a lot of  the other issues that would obviously have to be addressed in terms of infrastructure and services and so on.  It’s very much taking a first hand look at these matters and enabling us, if the Coalition is successful in a  few weeks’ time, to be able to hit the ground running when it comes to putting our plan to stop the boats in  place. We’re standing ready to do that and this trip is very much about making sure that we’re able to do that  from day one. So I look forward to that opportunity and I thank Dr Keke who first passed on that invitation  when we met, when Julie and I met with him a week or so ago and I’m looking forward to doing that on  Sunday. Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

You told us earlier today that you wouldn’t discuss whether you’d live in the Lodge or Kirribilli because you  don’t want to get ahead of yourself. Yet today you’re meeting with the President of Nauru. Isn’t that getting  ahead of yourself?

TONY ABBOTT:

This was not a negotiation. Only a government can negotiate with another government, we were simply  enquiring as to the true disposition of the Nauruan Government and the Nauruan people. It has been claimed  in this campaign by Prime Minister Gillard that there is some impediment, some practical impediment to  picking up the phone to Nauru and getting this offshore processing centre established almost immediately.  Today’s meeting was about establishing beyond any shadow of doubt that there is no impediment, that the  Nauruan Government could make the decision tomorrow, to reopen the centre. So, it was really about  establishing whether the Prime Minister’s representations were valid and plainly they’re not.

QUESTION:

A campaign launch is a big set piece in an election campaign, with what’s going on with Labor are you  worried that this will overshadow your campaign launch tomorrow and within your heart do you have any  sympathy for Julia Gillard, for someone like Mark Latham to turn up at her press conference?

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously there is a fair old soap opera going on, on the other side of politics and I guess like all soap  operas its riveting drama, but I don’t think the public want drama from their politicians, I think they want  good government from their politicians and that’s what I am offering them. Good government and from day  one we would take decisive steps to end the waste, to pay back the debt, to stop the big new taxes and to  stop the boats and that’s what I’m doing every day of this campaign.

QUESTION:

The running of that centre, he said that it was UN and Australian officials that run that centre in Nauru, have  you got agreement with the UN to put their staff into the centre?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, we aren’t a government and this meeting was not a government to government negotiation. It  couldn’t be, we were exploring what was possible on Nauru so that we would know exactly what could be  achieved on day one of an incoming Coalition government, so that’s what we’ve been doing and what I can  say based on the meeting today, that the Nauruans are ready, willing and able to re-open that centre and  there is no impediment, no impediment whatsoever from the Nauruan Government making the decision to  do so now.

QUESTION:

You would have to offer money and incentives to the Nauruan people and also did they agree to sign up to  the Refugee Convention?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, this was not a negotiation, we wanted to establish beyond any shadow of doubt that the Narurans  are ready, willing and able to re-open the centre and they can make the decision to do so immediately should  that be the result of a government to government negotiation. So obviously, there were no discussions of the  sort you allude to but I do point out that the processing centre on Nauru cost far, far less than the money that  the current government is spending in twelve months on processing in Christmas Island and increasingly on  centres in mainland Australia.

QUESTION:

In discussions you said that you would prefer Nauru to sign up to the UN Refugee Convention, is it  something you’ve let them know about and in terms of time line, how soon could you actually get people  there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this business of requiring that they sign the Convention is simply a furphy that’s been raised by the  Prime Minister. When the processing centre was opened before, it was operated by the International  Organisation Migration, under UN auspices and the fact that the UN, that Nauru had not signed the UN  convention, didn’t stop UN involvement in the running of the processing centre.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, who instigated the meeting with the President of Nauru, who is covering the costs and have they  given any indication as to what kind of payment in Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

I might ask Scott to handle that, because my understanding is this meeting today arose out of the discussions  which Scott and Julie had with the Foreign Minister Keke, a week or so back and my understanding is the  Nauruans were here in Brisbane, in any event, as part of the wrap up from the Pacific Islands Forum that  they’ve just been at, but I might ask Scott and Julie to add to that.

SCOTT MORRISON:

I can confirm that, the Nauruan President was here under his own steep today and that of the Nauruan  Government. There was an opportunity to meet with him today and as Julie mentioned at the outset, the  opportunity was there today for the Prime Minister to meet with the Nauruan President, but as Tony said,  she had another pressing engagement with the former Prime Minister and so that’s basically where we’re at  today. It was a good opportunity to take further from our discussions from just over a week ago and for  Tony and his Excellency actively had that discussion today, which was very positive.

QUESTION:

What about the cost…

SCOTT MORRISON:

Just on the costs, as Tony said before, this was not an official negotiation. This was an opportunity to  explore the opportunity, if we were elected, in a few weeks time to enter into such negotiations and their  ability and preparedness to do so and it was crystal clear that they are and able to do that. The Australian  Government currently gives just under $30 million in foreign aid to Nauru. That has been the case for some  period of time and its something that should continue to enjoy bipartisan support, I would hope.

JULIE BISHOP:

Can I just make another point? The Foreign Minister of Nauru was in Brisbane en route to a conference. We  took the opportunity to meet with him. The Government did not. The President is in Brisbane today, the  President of Nauru, we took the opportunity to meet with him. The Government did not. The Pacific Islands  Forum was held last week, the President of Nauru was present at the Forum, the Foreign Minister of  Australia was present at the Forum and did not take the opportunity to speak to the President of Nauru about  the processing centre, built and paid for by the Australian Government and yet the Government insists that it  is negotiating with East Timor to build another processing centre. Yet the Deputy Prime Minister of East  Timor says the Government isn’t negotiating with East Timor, so we wanted to be sure that should the  Coalition be elected to Government, we would be in a position to work with Nauru and they have confirmed  again today they’re ready, willing and able to reopen the processing centre, should the Australian  Government wish to negotiate with them.

QUESTION:

What guidelines international standards will you use, processing centre is still suitable for asylum seekers  and what other considerations will determine whether they should be sent there?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well, the guidelines and standards are set out by the UNHCR and under our obligations under various other  treaties, so that’s always been the case, they’re the things we honoured when we were last in Government  and we put this plan into action and it had the result that we hoped it would achieve and that’s our resolve to  do so again.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you. Thanks very much.
