M? Speaker  : . 1

I WISH TO INFORM THE HOUC Ã¢ÂÂ   OF DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT

RESULTING FROM THE REVIEW OF THE MIGRANT-SELECTION SYSTEM,

NUMAS, 1  . .

The r e v ie w  was one of the Go v e r n m e n t ' s 1980 e l e c t io n  commitments

AND FULFILLS AN UNDERTAKING, MADE AT THE TIME NUMAS WAS

INTRODUCED, TO REVIEW THE SYSTEM IN THE LIGHT OF OPERATIONAL  \

EXPERIENCE,

AS PART OF THE REVIEW PROCESS, AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE OF

Re v ie w  on Mig r a n t  Assessment  wa^ g iv e n  the task  of r e p o r t in g  to

ME on"THE VIEWS OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AND ON A NUMBER OF

STUDIES OF THE OPERATION OF NUMAS

Honourable  Members  w i l l  rec all  t h a t t tabled  the Co m m it t e e ' s

FINDINGS ON 9 SEPTEMBER.

The Re v i e w was cond ucted  i n a most open manner w i t h as much p u b l i c

INVOLVEMENT AS POSSIBLE, COMMUNITY VIEWS WERE OBTAINED THROUGH

A SERIES OF FORUMS AROUND AUSTRALIA AND THROUGH WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

I.N RESPONSE TO ADVERTISEMENTS. ÃÂªÃÂÃÂ COMMITTEE OF REVIEW NOTED THAT

IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS CAME FROM AUSTRALIAN-BORN AS WELL AS FROM

OVERSEAS-BORN INDIVIDUALS AND FROM NON-MIGRANT BASED AS WELL AS FROM

MIGRANT-BASED ORGANISATIONS,

The Gove rnmen t  i s i n d e b t e d  t o. the Co m m i t t e e  for i t s e x a m i n a t i o n  of

THE RANGE OF OPINIONS THE COMMUNITY BROUGHT FORWARD AND FOR ITS

ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES, I n ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT

the Go ver n m en t  h a s had t h e b e n e f i t  of a range of other a d v i c e , i n c l u d i n g

YEAR JUST PAST, 1 9 8 0 - 8 1 ,  FOR AN INTAKE OF JUST OVER 1 1 0 , 0 0 0  NEW

SETTLERS OUR OVERSEAS POSTS HAD TO PROCESS MORE THAN ONE MILLION ‘

INQUIRIES AND APPLICATIONS. SELECTION IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL,

Before the p r e s e n t s e l e c t i o n  sy s t e m was announced  i n June 1978 a

GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND EFFORT WAS PUT INTO EXAMINING THE PHILOSOPHY

WHICH SHOULD LIE BEHIND OUR IMMIGRATION PROGRAM. HONOURABLE

Mr Sp e a k e r , I seek leave  to inco rp o ra te  i n Hansard  a summary

of the new Mig r a n t  Se l e c t i o n  Sy s t e m . .

The new sys te m  w i l l  strongly  favour  s k i l l e d  a p p l i c a n t s  and

THOSE WITH CLOSE FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA.

I N  P A R T I C U L A R  SUCH S U B J E C T I V E  FACTORS AS I N I T I A T I V E  AND

A d a p t a b i l i t y . I n p r a c t i c e , we found  that  use of d i s c r e t i o n  by

IMMIGRATION OFFICERS GAVE THE SETTLEMENT ASSESSMENT THE HUMAN

FACE ITS NUMERICAL STRUCTURE SEEMED TO BELIE. R y ABOLISHING

Part B of NUMAS, the new system  formally  re c o g n is e s  the human

FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE SELECTION OF PEOPLE. I t IS INTENDED

THAT UNDER THE [/'SETTLEMENT ASSESSMENT APPLICANTS WILL BE

ASSESSED AS "OUTSTANDING", "GOOD", "SATISFACTORY", "UNSATISFACTORY",

"SERIOUS SETTLEMENT RISK".

, , . /5 .

The economi 'c/ employment  ass e s s m e nt  w i l l  be broadly  comparable

w it h  the e x i s t i n g  Par t A OF NUMAS. It w i l l  however  drop the

PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT OF TRANSFERABLE ASSETS AND OF ABILITY TO

COMMUNICATE IN PROPOSED EMPLOYMENT, WHILE ADDING EXTRA POINTS

FOR ABILITY TO LEARN ENGLISH, PRECISE DISTRIBUTIONS OF POINTS

WILL BE. DETERMINED AFTER FIELD TESTING, .

IN LINE WITH THE INCREASED EMPHASIS ON LABOUR MARKET REQUIREMENTS

CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN TO EXPANDING AND UPGRADING THE

Oc c u p a t io n a l  Demand  Schedule  w hich  i s  used as the b a s is  of

MIGRANT SELECTION. .

In CONSIDERING SELECTION CRITERIA GENERALLY THE GOVERNMENT WAS

MINDFUL OF ANY POTENTIAL FOR DISCRIMINATORY EFFECTS. THIS

WAS A MAJOR CONCERN OF SOME CONTRIBUTORS TO THE NUMAS REVIEW.

The w e ig h t in g  g iv e n  to En g l i s h - language  r e q u ir e m e n t s ,

PARTICULARLY, WERE CONSIDERED TO FAVOUR ANGLO-SAXONSÂ·

In f a c t , the Co m m it t e e  of Re v ie w  found  agreement  among m ig r a n t s ,

SETTLEMENT STAFF, RESEARCHERS AND EXPERTS THAT THE ABILITY TO

speak  En g l is h  i s c r u c ia l  to a number  of aspects  of short  and

LONG-TERM SETTLEMENT. THE COMMONWEALTH-STATES SURVEY OF .

Set tl e m e n t  Ex p e r i e n c e , c i t e d  in the Co m m it t e e ' s r e p o r t ,

showed  En g l is h  to be important  for o b t a i n i n g  a j o b , As m igr a n ts

WHO WERE UNABLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT ACKNOWLEDGED, LACK OF ENGLISH

DIMINISHES PROSPECTS OF SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT. ÃÂªÃÂÃÂ GOVERNMENT

HAS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT COMPETENCE IN ENGLISH AND T H |  A B IL IT Y

to le ar n En g l i s h d e m o n s t r a t e d , for e x a m p l e, by knowledge of

OTHER LANGUAGES -  ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF SETTLEMENT

p r o s p e c t s , Ab i l i t y  to lear n En g l i s h w i l l t h e r e f o r e be

REFLECTED IN THE ECONOMIC/EMPLOYMENT ASSESSMENT,

A FURTHER CHANGE WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED UPON IS THAT

APPLICANTS FOR MIGRATION WILL GAIN CONCESSIONAL POINTS WHEN THEY

WISH TO SETTLE IN DESIGNATED GROWTH AREAS, GROWTH AREAS WILL BE

DECIDED IN CONSULTATION WITH STATES AND TERRITORIES AND RELEVANT

De p a r t m e n t s , ' Th i s i n i t i a t i v e  can be e x p e c t e d to reduce

SETTLEMENT PRESSURES IN CAPITAL C I T I E S ,  ESPECIALLY SYDNEY AND

Me l b o u r n e, as well as to enhanc e t h e m o b i l i t y  of labour t h a t

RESOURCE DEVELOPMENTS WILL GENERATE,

An IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE SELECTION ASSESSMENT IS THE RECOGNITION

OF QUALIFICATIONS, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR THE QUALIFICATIONS Â·

OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES TO.BE RECOGNISED AND DTI LI SI ED MORE

w i d e l y , Th i s i s not a q u e s t i o n  of l o w e r in g Au s t r a l i a n  st an d ar d s

BUT RATHER OF PROVIDING QUICK, ACCURATE.AND UNBIASED ASSESSMENTS

OF THE REAL LEVEL OF SKILL WHICH MIGRANT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY

ALREADY POSSESS, In THIS REGARD THE STATES HAVE AGREED TO

CO-OPERATE WITH THE COMMONWEALTH IN A WIDE-RANGING REVIEW TO

INCLUDE SUCH SPECIFIC ISSUES AS: -  *

*  THE LACK OF SPECIAL COURSES TO BRING PEOPLE UP TO

Au s t r a l i a n  s t a n d a r d s;

PREVIOUSLY ADMITTED UNDER THE GENERAL E L I G I B I L I T Y  CRITERIA,

Le t me g i v e a co ncrete i l l u s t r a t i o n , Re c e n t l y I had o c c a s io n

TO CONSIDER THE CASE OF A GREEK FAMILY WHERE THE HUSBAND WAS

A HOUSE PAINTER. THE BROTHER-IN-LAW HERE IN AUSTRALIA IS A

b u s i n e s s . However t h e a p p l i c a n t s  i n Greece j u s t f a i l e d  to

PASS NUMAS EVEN TAKING. INTO ACCOUNT THE CONCESSIONAL POINTS

UNDER THE INDEPENDENT FAMILY NOMINATION SCHEME. UNDER THE

NEW ARRANGEMENTS, WHERE THE SUPPORT AND JOB OFFER ARE MORE

FULLY RECOGNISED I HAVE NO DOUBT THE APPLICATION WOULD HAVE

BEEN ONE FOR APPROVAL.

So THAT PEOPLE AFFECTED BY' DECISIONS CAN UNDERSTAND THE BASIS

OF THEM, THEY WILL BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF .  Z

I m m ig r a t io n  and Et h n i c  Af f a ir s  in s t r u c t io n  m a n u a l . Th i s

IN IT IA T IV E  IS ONE ASPECT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S POLICY TO HELP

PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEM.

Im m i g r a t i o n  p l a y s an e s s e n t i a l  role i n t he labour market

BY PROVIDING OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE SKILLS FOR DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS AND IN RELIEVING SHORTAGES OF PARTICULAR SKILLS.

The new s e l e c t i o n  s y s t e m c a r r i e s a strong Labour Mar k e t

EMPHASIS ALONG WITH THE CONCESSIONS TO FAMILY MIGRATION.

The new ca te gory -  Labour Shortage and Bu s i n e s s Mi g r a t i o n  -

WILL COMPRISE APPLICANTS WITH OCCUPATIONS IN DEMAND IN

Au s t r a l i a , e m p l o y m e n t n o m i n e e s and b u s i n e s s  m i g r a n t s . Peo ple

ADMITTED UNDER THIS CATEGORY WILL HAVE SKILLS OR CHARACTERISTICS

OF DIRECT BENEFIT TO AUSTRALIA. AND HERE I WANT TO MAKE IT

CLEAR THAT THE SKILLS AND QUALITIES WE WILL BE SEEKING

ARE THOSE WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN AUSTRALIA. We WILL

HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY AND ADEQUATELY

INFORMED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNIES AUSTRALIA OFFERS.

Through t h e Bu s i n e s s Mi g r a t i o n  program, we w i l l be s e e k i n g to

ATTRACT PEOPLE OF FLAIR AND PROVEN ENTERPRISE WHO WILL HELP US

FULFILL OUR POTENTIAL DURING THE 1 9 80 $ , ’

W e w i l l  be loo k in g  for people  who w i l l  take an a c t i v e  role

IN DEVELOPING AUSTRALIA USING THEIR EXPERTISE AND TECHNOLOGICAL

knowhow  to Au s t r a l i a ' s b e n e f i t  b y :

*  INTRODUCING A NEW INDUSTRY

*  IMPROVING AN EXISTING INDUSTRY .

*  EXPANDING AUSTRALIA'S EXPORTS, OR . .

. *  PROMOTING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNTIES IN AUSTRALIA.

Through  the Employment  No m i n a t i o n  Scheme , we w i l l  be encouraging

EMPLOYERS WHO CAN SHOW THEY HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO RECRUIT LOCALLY.

TO LOOK OVERSEAS WHEN THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THE

MOMENTUM OF THEIR INDUSTRY ARE NOT AVAILABLE HERE. I WANT TO

EMPHASISE THOUGH THAT WE WILL NOT BE BRINGING PEOPLE HERE ONLY

TO COMPETE WITH AUSTRALIANS FOR SCARCE JOBS. T hEv GoVERNMENT WILL

CONTINUE TO GIVE TOP PRIORITY TO THE TRAINING AND RETRAINING

of Au s t r a l i a n s , e s p e c i a l l y  young Au s t r a l i a n s .

Wi t h i n  the I ndependent  Mi g r a t i o n  ca tegory , there  w i l l  be room

FOR PEOPLE OF PROVEN ACHIEVEMENT AND DISTINCTION IN OCCUPATIONS

WHERE DEMAND MAY BE LIMITED. THERE WOULD BE ROOM ALSO FOR

CONSIDERING THE CLAIMS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN AUSTRALIA

PREVIOUSLY. IT IS NOT INTENDED THAT THIS SHOULD BECOME ANOTHER

"General  El i g i b i l i t y " c a t e g o r y . The Government  e x p e c ts  that

FEWER THAN 5 000 PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO QUALIFY UNDER THIS CATEGORY

IN THE FI RST YEAR. OF OPERATION. APPLICANTS WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY

OF THE RELEVANT POINTS WHEN THEIR OCCUPATIONS ARE IN OVERSUPPLY

OR MINOR OVERSUPPLY.
