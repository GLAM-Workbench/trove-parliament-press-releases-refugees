Visit to East Timor

I will visit East Timor on 30 August at the invitation of the National Council for Timorese Resistance (CNRT) to represent the Australian Government at ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the popular consultation held on 30 August 1999.

This will be my first visit since the historic UN-run ballot was held and the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) assumed responsibility last October for East Timor's transition to independence.

During my visit I expect to hold discussions with the Secretary-General's Special Representative for East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, CNRT President Xanana Gusmao, and other UNTAET officials and East Timorese leaders.

I will also meet with members of the Australian Defence Force and Australian Police personnel serving with UNTAET.

Australia remains firmly committed to the peace and stability of East Timor, and I will use the opportunity of my visit to emphasise Australia's continuing support for East Timor's long-term reconstruction and development.

UNTAET has made real progress in the face of enormous challenges, and I particularly welcome the steps taken towards independence by UNTAET, in partnership with the East Timorese, underscored by the principles of transparency, tolerance and good governance.

I will also use my visit to underline the Australian Government's ongoing concern at the militia activity in the East Timor/Indonesia border region, and the need for a resolution to the situation of East Timorese refugees in camps in West Timor.
