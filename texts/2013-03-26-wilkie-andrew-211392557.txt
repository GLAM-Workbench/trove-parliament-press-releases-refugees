STATEMENT REGARDING ASYLUM SEEKERS



The latest asylum seeker boat tragedy is another damning indictment of the Government’s

flawed irregular immigration policy.



This is not a border security problem but a humanitarian challenge.



Unless and until there is a sophisticated policy addressing source, first asylum and transit

countries the boats will keep coming.



It’s way beyond time for the Government to craft such a policy.
