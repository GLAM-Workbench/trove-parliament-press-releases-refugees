Outreach visits come to Dubbo

Wednesday, 21 March 2007

Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be in  Dubbo next week as part of a regional outreach visit.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach  trips were a great way for people in regional areas to sit down and talk about  immigration-related issues face-to-face with DIAC officers.

“The Australian Government places great importance on providing services to  regional areas and these visits are a large part of that,” Mr Andrews said.

“These appointments attract a range of people, from farmers to small  business owners, community groups to individuals, who might want  information or just someone to talk them through a complex matter.

“While the Department has a great deal of information available over the  phone or on the internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face,  and these visits are about meeting that need,” he said.

“In the past, we have found that the most popular topics relate to citizenship,  work visas, visas for family members and how to propose and sponsor  refugees.”

The DIAC team is also visiting Orange, Bathurst, Lightning Ridge, Wellington,  Mudgee and Lithgow during this tour.

DIAC officers will be available for an appointment in Dubbo on Tuesday March  27 from 4pm to 6pm and Wednesday March 28 from 9am to 1pm.

Appointments will be held at the Dubbo Neighbourhood Centre, 213 Brisbane  St. Bookings are essential.  Telephone: 6882 2100
