CHRIS BOWEN: Well thanks for coming everybody. Another day, another excuse  from the Liberal Party as to why they won’t be upfront with the Australian people  about how they’ll pay for their promises and budget black hole. Today we’ve seen  yet another announcement from the Opposition, yet another excuse as to why they  won’t comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty.

Submitting your costings to three eminent Australians is no replacement for  submitting them to the Australian people.

The Australian people should see not only the Liberal Party costings but how they  are going to pay for their budget black hole. They should see what the Liberal Party  is going to cut to pay for their promises and to fill their budget black hole. We’ve seen  today, Mr Hockey say that he can’t release his costings and funding until all his  policies are released. This is just nonsense. The Liberal Party could do what the  Labor Government has done and release costings and funding as each policy is  released. This is code from Mr Hockey saying he won’t be releasing his package of  costings and cuts until the very last days of the election campaign.

And then we see Mr Hockey today and Mr Cormann announcing some sort of new  process about half way through the election campaign. These are people who have  had three years to prepare for this election campaign. Everybody knew this election  campaign was coming and yet half way through the election campaign we see a new  process being announced and yet another desperate excuse and attempt to avoid  the scrutiny of the Australian people.

What’s going on here is very clear. Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey do not want to be  upfront with the Australian people about what they will cut because if the Australian  people are told what they’ll cut, Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey are very afraid that they’ll  be much less likely to vote for them.

JOURNALIST: Treasurer, aren’t you saying to these three eminent people don’t  have much in integrity?

BOWEN: No, not at all. These are three eminent Australians. I have no problems  with the Australians who have been chosen for the panel; my problem is that they  need a panel to start with. There’s a process already in place.

We don’t need a glossy document outlining how the Liberal Party will cost its  policies. There’s a document that already exists, it’s not glossy but it’s called the  Charter of Budget Honesty. It was introduced by Peter Costello and there’s no  excuse for Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott not to be complying with it.

JOURNALIST: And so the exercise adds no legitimacy whatsoever?

BOWEN: No, none at all because we’ve seen again, excuse after excuse. We were  told just last week by Mr Abbott and Mr Brandis that there were 200 policies already  costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office ready to go. Well if there’s 200 policies  costed and ready to go why don’t we see them? Why now do we have a new

process all of sudden being announced today? When last week we were told it’s all  in hand, 200 policies already been costed.

Now this is a fig leaf and an attempt at an excuse for not being upfront with the  Australian people. Showing your costings to three men is not an excuse for not  showing them to all the Australian people.

JOURNALIST: Treasurer, if we could turn to the polls, it’s not going well for Labor at  the moment. Are you still convinced that Labor will do better under Mr Rudd then it  would have done under Ms Gillard?

BOWEN:  I am very certain that Labor is very competitive in this tight race. I am very  certain that there’s a long way to go in this race. And I know Mr Abbott thinks he’s  got it in the bag, he’s been measuring up the Lodge and I know that there are plenty  of Liberal candidates around the country who think they may have it in the bag but  that is not the case. This election campaign is just about halfway, there’s a long way  to go, anybody who’s calling this election or thinks they’ve got this election won, is  sadly mistaken.

JOURNALIST: So you have no regrets in your role of reinstalling Mr Rudd as  parliamentary leader?

BOWEN:  No, certainly not. Kevin Rudd is a fantastic Prime Minister and I believe he  can lead Labor to victory in this election. Because he is leading a team committed to  jobs and investment. He’s leading a team with a positive plan for the future and we

will continue to point out the contrast; Kevin Rudd’s positive plan for the future, on  show today, for example in Adelaide, investing for jobs and a new economy; Mr  Abbott cutting and with only negativity.

JOURNALIST: Treasurer, surely there are some issues with the Prime Minister’s  announcement that aren’t being costed as well like the Northern Australia plan?

BOWEN:  Well let’s be clear about this. The Prime Minister announced a Northern  Australia plan, it’s a good plan. It outlines some immediate measures which are fully  costed and funded and outlined. We also outlined some things which can happen

over the longer term, beyond the budget forward estimates and things that need a lot  more consultation with state and territory administration and business like the tax  treatment in a special economic zone. That is something which wouldn’t start until  beyond the forward estimates of the budget and there’s more consultation.

So the Prime Minister’s lined that out and he’s laid out what consultation  mechanisms will be in place. But any policy we’ve announced or will announce that  will impact on the budget in the forward estimates has been fully costed, fully funded  and complying with the Charter of Budget Honesty.

JOURNALIST: Well surely that’s politicking then? Making an announcement that’s  beyond the forward estimates is not going to have any immediate impact over the  next term of Government.

BOWEN: I’ll tell you what - there’s nothing wrong with a bit of vision, with a bit of  forward thinking, saying, ‘This is where I want to take Northern Australia, it will take a  few years to get there, there will be consultation but this is my vision for Northern  Australia’; that’s what the Prime Minister is saying.  And I think that’s something that  the Australian people will respond positively to. A bit of vision about the future, not  just about the next four years, but about what’s beyond the next four years.

JOURNALIST: Just returning quickly to the polls, are you concerned about the  chances in your own seat?

BOWEN: I have never, in my nine years as a member of parliament taken my seat  for granted. In my nine years in public office before that representing Fairfield  Council, I’ve never taken one vote for granted. I’ll be fighting for every last vote,  earning every last vote, I believe again the people of McMahon deserve nothing less.

JOURNALIST: There have been allegations about the Liberal candidate [inaudible]

BOWEN: Well look, this is a matter for Mr Abbott and Mr King to answer. These  things are a test of leadership, frankly. A week or so ago we saw allegations against  a Labor candidate; what did the Prime Minister do? He ordered an immediate  investigation, received the report of the investigation, when he wasn’t satisfied,  asked the National Executive to remove that person as the Labor candidate in the  election.

The Prime Minister passed that test of leadership. It’s up to Mr Abbott, not just to  shrug his shoulders and say ‘nothing to see here’, but to explain to the Australian  people what process he intends to put in place and how he intends to deal with these  allegations.

JOURNALIST: Treasurer, what do you say to claims that you have unfairly taken  some kudos from making a cancer drug available?

BOWEN: Oh look, this is clearly a Liberal Party beat up. Everybody in my community  knows that I organised a petition of around 30,000 signatures. The Liberal  Government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to list Herceptin as a cancer  drug. Me and other Labor Members of Parliament, Sharon Bird, the Member for  Cunningham, was very active. I remember Roger Price, former Member for Chifley  and a number of Labor Members of Parliament across the board organised and  coordinated a campaign because Tony Abbott would not list Herceptin.

And my community remembers that very clearly, so I’m not going to be distracted by  this Liberal Party attempt to change the dynamics of what was a very clear process -  of the Liberal Government refusing to list a drug that was very important to many  women across Australia and which the Labor Party and Labor Members of  Parliament, organised by me and other Members of Parliament, arranged a  campaign to have it listed and successfully got it listed.

JOURNALIST: Papua New Guinea has said it won’t be able to keep all of the  refugees - what do you make of that?

BOWEN: Well look, I think that the process that’s outlined in the agreement with  Papua New Guinea is clear; Prime Minister O’Neil’s comments at the time of signing  with Prime Minister Rudd are clear. I’ll leave Minister Burke to comment on details as  is appropriate.

But what’s very clear is that we have a strong and enduring arrangement with Papua  New Guinea. It’s starting to have some effect. It will take some time to have its full  effect, but its starting have some effect. Our approach is to get the agreement of the  country that we’re taking people to unlike the Opposition who seem to think they can  take people to a country which says ‘no’ - Indonesia.

JOURNALIST: But Mr O’Neil, the Prime Minister, says there is no agreement that all  genuine refugees will be resettled in -

BOWEN: - Well, as I’ve said I think that the agreement is clear and that its clearly  starting to work and I’m more than happy to leave it for the Immigration Minister to  comment on further details.
