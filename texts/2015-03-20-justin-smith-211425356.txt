THE HON. BILL SHORTEN  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  MEMBER FOR MARIBYRNONG



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW - 2UE  LINDT CAFÃÂ, SYDNEY  FRIDAY, 20 MARCH 2015

SUBJECT/ S: Re-opening of Lindt cafÃÂ©; Passing of Prime Minister Fraser.

JUSTIN SMITH, HOST: The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten joins us. Good  afternoon Bill.

BILL SHORTEN, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Great to be here today.

SMITH: The smiling faces in there to see - I was just speaking to Steven Loane, CEO  of Lindt Australia - to see those faces, to see them with some spirit is magnificent, isn’t  it?

SHORTEN: I am always proud to be Australian, but I have to say just seeing the range  of people coming into the Lindt store on the day it has opened, not just from Sydney  but all over Australia, just ordinary people saying that nothing is going to stop them  from getting on with their lives. It gives you goosebumps and when you talk to some of  the regular customers who say the shop is as it was basically before the terrible event  just makes you very proud to be Australian today.

SMITH: I said to the CEO before, to Steven, that there seemed to be a little fist-pump  around Australia when we found out that it was going to be a cafÃÂ© again. It was a real  act of defiance - well defiance is probably too much and it sounds like we are in a  battle here but it was just, as I keep saying a celebration of normal. Do you feel that  way?

SHORTEN: Yeah, it doesn’t matter how many times the idiots and bad people try and  knock you down, you just get back up again. Talking to the staff, talking to the  customers, this is ordinary people - this isn’t about parades or waving the flag - I was  talking to people in the queue and this is about ordinary people saying ‘do you know  what, I am going to go to this cafÃÂ©, I’m not going to let this act of evil get us down’.  And you could just see a whole lot of ordinary people, they watch on the news every  night, they see violence or they see dreadful things happening and what I think in  there, and these are modest people in there - the thousands of people that go through  there, this is their 5, 10, 15 minutes of standing up and saying ‘Yeah, we are better  than these people’.



SMITH: Yeah, Absolutely. I see a box there with ‘Happy Easter’ written on it. Can you  talk me through this purchase please?

SHORTEN:  The kids love Easter -

SMITH: Oh there is a shock (laughter).

SHORTEN: There are a few treats in there -

SMITH: There will be a few less in there after this interview.

SHORTEN: No, you seem to employ starving looking staff so I am happy to leave the  odd Easter egg with them. But I will take the box home to the kids because I am away  so often so this is nice - Lindt, it is a European brand but I suspect it is an Australian  brand.

SMITH: Absolutely, well said. Bill, it is good to see you. Malcolm Fraser just very  quickly.

SHORTEN: A great Australian. 6 decades of service, international statesmen - I  understand  he had his argument with the Labor party but really when you look at the  sum of the man’s life, it is a remarkable contribution. He lead the push against  Apartheid in South Africa. His leadership gave a signal to the nation that we welcome  Vietnamese-Australian boat people. That is the role of leadership - it is to send the  signal to be our better selves. And of course, he got very involved in human rights and  indeed, in his most recent years, he would ring me and say ‘Bill, Labor has to do this or  that’. And I know his wife Tamie, our thoughts are with her and I have spoken with her  this morning and conveyed Chloe, my wife and my condolences. He is a significant  Australian - Some people disagreed with what he did, Labor certainly did on  somethings -

SMITH: Well you said he picked a fight with Labor, he picked a fight with everyone  towards the end - he didn’t miss any body.



SHORTEN: I read a journalist made a comment that he was a true liberal in that small  ‘l’ sense of the Liberal Party.  He made a significant contribution and he continued to  make a significant contribution for the whole of his life and you can’t ask much more of

people than that can you?

SMITH: Absolutely. Mr Shorten, Thank you.
