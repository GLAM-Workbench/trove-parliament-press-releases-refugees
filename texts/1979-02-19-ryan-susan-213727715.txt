STATEMENT BY ACTING OPPOSITION SPOKESPERSON FOR IMMIGRATION, SENATOR.

SUSAN RYAN - 19 February 1979

The Acting Opposition Spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Susan Ryan,

said today that the decision by Immigration Minister Mackellar to-give

refugee status to the defector from a Russian ship demonstrated a clear

lack.of consistency in the Fraser Governmentâ€™s immigration policy.

"The decision to allow Miss Gasinskayoy to stay in Australia is not in

itself a bad decision. However the Minister's action and comments in this

matter must cause distress and confusion to many migrants in Australia

who have been refused permission to bring close relatives here."

"Mr Mackellar has not hesitated to deport dozens of non-Australians whose

claims to stay here appeared much stronger than Miss Gasinskayoy's. His

recent callous deportation of a Bangladesh family with a blind son is a

case in point." .  '  .  . .

Senator Ryan .said it was totally unsatisfactory that in a sensitive and

human area like: immigration, the Government had no comprehensible policy .

and the Minister appeared to act on whim. .

"The Opposition would like to see a much more generous and humane policy

in the areas of family reunion, resident aliens and genuine refugees." .
