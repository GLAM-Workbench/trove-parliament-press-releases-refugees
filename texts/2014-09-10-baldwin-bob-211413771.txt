$72 million pilot programme assesses  Australia's future energy needs  10 September 2014  The Australian Government is continuing to work with the energy industry and electricity  consumers to reduce electricity bills and continue energy market reform, with the launch of  an innovative pilot programme plotting the energy habits of 26,500 people across the nation.

Bob Baldwin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, said the federal  government had contributed $55 million of the $72 million program to fund 20 projects  concluding in mid-2016.

Mr Baldwin launched the latest project, Energy Efficiency in the 3rd Age (EE3A), from the  Illawarra region in NSW today. He said the aims of (EE3A) were to identify better ways to  improve the energy efficiency of low income households and enable them to better manage  their usage without impacting on their quality of life.

“By repealing the carbon tax earlier this year, this government has reduced homeowners’  power bills and relieved some of the other cost of living pressures many Australians are  experiencing,” Mr Baldwin said.

“This programme is our next step to ensure we gather the information we need to create  better informed energy policy. This government is committed to providing cheaper and more  reliable electricity to all Australians.”

Eddy De Gabriele, Chair of Regional Development Australia Illawarra (RDAI) said the $2.3  million EE3A project would gather data from up to 800 Illawarra households over the next 18  months.

“This is one of the largest research and education undertakings of its kind and it is testament  to the skills and expertise we have here in the Region,” Mr De Gabriele said. “The EE3A  brings together our internationally renowned university, our most experienced and long-time  operators in the aged sector, suppliers and those at the coal face who understand first-hand  the issues and challenges facing low income older Australians when it comes improving  energy efficiency.”

The EE3A project has recruited 800 households to participate in various trials run by the  University of Wollongong.. The participating households are from the local government areas  of Wollongong, Shellharbour, Kiama, Shoalhaven and Wingecarribee. It will include an  awareness raising programme, engagement with local manufacturers and suppliers to trial  new green approaches and a large research component to intensively monitor the impacts of  the energy efficiency technologies and behaviour changes of the project, conducted by the  University of Wollongong.

The EE3A consortium of RDA Illawarra, the University of Wollongong, IRT Group,  Warrigal, Illawarra Forum, WEA Illawarra, Southern Councils Group and the Royal  Freemason's Benevolent Institution (RFBI) brings together some of the most experienced  organisations in the areas of data collection, research, aged care and education.
