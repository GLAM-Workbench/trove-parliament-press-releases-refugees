$124 MILLION BOOST FOR

THE FIGHT AGAINST ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION

Â

The government has agreed on a $124 million 
four year programme to strengthen Australia’s capacity to detect and 
deter illegal arrivals.

Â

Illegal immigration is a growing globa  l problem with an estimated 
4 million illegal entries worldwide each year, and worth some $10 billion 
dollars to increasingly well organised and sophisticated people smuggling 
syndicates.

Â

The measures to be taken by the government represent the most comprehensive 
changes to coastal surveillance since the establishment of Coastwatch 
in 1988.

Â

They include:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Two additional Dash 8 aircraft to extend the footprint and intensity 
of Coastwatch’s aerial surveillance, particularly along the east coast 
(see map)

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â An additional night capable helicopter to 
be deployed in the Torres Strait

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â The establishment of a national surveillance centre at Coastwatch’s 
Canberra headquarters with electronic links to state government agencies 
and Defence establishments

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   A new 
position of Director-General of Coastwatch reporting directly to the 
CEO of the Australian Customs Service. The position will be filled on 
secondment by a senior officer of the Australian Defence Force. Liaison 
arrangements between Coastwatch, Defence and other agencies will also 
be strengthened.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Expanding Australia’s capacity to detect and deter illegal immigration 
from source and transit countries through posting twelve immigration 
officers to major source and transit countries, including as air  port liaison officers 
at key airports.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Conclusion of bilateral agreements with source and transit countries 
for cooperation on people smuggling issues and to provide for the return 
of illegal arrivals

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Strong support for the conclusion as soon as po  ssible of a protocol on people smuggling to the proposed UN Convention 
on Transnational Organised Crime

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Establishment of a high level Information Oversight Committee, 
chaired by the Office of National Assessments (ONA), to coordinate information 
and in  telligence 
on people smuggling

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Introduction of comprehensive legislative amendments which the 
Government will put before parliament shortly to strengthen maritime 
investigatory and enforcement powers to complement legislation on stronger 
penalties agai  nst people smuggling.

Â

These and other measures to which the government 
has agreed are contained in the report of my task force on coastal surveillance 
chaired by the Secretary of my department, Mr Max Moore-Wilton. A list 
of the task force’s recommendati  ons, all of which have been accepted, is attached. Additional resources 
will be provided to implement the recommendations, with agencies to 
absorb personnel costs where there is capacity to do so.

Â

When fully implemented these measures will greatly enhance Australia’s 
capacity to deal with the increasing threat of illegal immigration. 
Each illegal arrival in Australia costs some $50,000 in processing costs, 
and illegal boat arrivals pose potentially devastating quarantine consequences 
for Australia’s $13.5 billion agricultural industry.

Â

With 37,000 kilometres of coastline and 9 million square kilometres 
of ocean to cover, no Australian coastal surveillance system can be 
foolproof. But the measures I am announcing today will greatly strengthen 
the current system. They are a sound investment in the integrity of 
Australia’s borders, and represent a more cost effective solution 
than the creation of an Australian coastguard or transfer of the coastal 
surveillance function to the Defence force.

Â

I have written to all the Premiers and Chief Ministers advising them 
of the decisions. I have also asked Mr Moore-Wilton to brief his state 
and territory counterparts on the implementation of the measures.

Â

I would like to thank all the members of the task force for their 
report. I would also like to thank all those, including state and territory 
governments, who made submissions to the task force.

RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE PRIME 
MINISTER’S

COASTAL SURVEILLANCE TASK 
FORCE

Â

ACTION IN SOURCE AND 
TRANSIT COUNTRIES

Â

Recommendation 1

Â

That an Information Oversight Committee be 
established immediately of relevant agencies to coordinate the gathering 
and analysis of information and intelligence on people smuggling; and 
to oversee arrangements to facilitate intelligence exchanges with oth  er countries confronted 
by people smuggling.

Â

Recommendation 2

Â

That an additional 7 DIMA compliance officers be placed overseas in 
key Asian (Shanghai, Guangzhou, New Delhi, Colombo), African (Nairobi 
and Pretoria) and Middle East (Ankara) cities to detect and deter illegal 
immigration by boat and to strengthen information gathering. The cost 
over four years, including some local support, will be in the order 
of $9 million.

Â

Recommendation 3

Â

That since illegal immigration by air far exceeds illegal boat arrivals, 
and some illegal boat arrivals begin their journey with a plane flight, 
additional resources be provided for 5 additional DIMA airport liaison 
officers (ALO) in Bangkok, Denpasar, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. 
The cost over four years will be in the order of $5Â million.

Â

Recommendation 4

Â

That people smuggling issues receive a high priority in the work of 
Australia’s overseas missions, with representations made at ministerial 
level where appropriate and that missions in source and transit countries 
develop and implement strategies to regularly and widely disseminate 
targeted information on Australia’s policies on people smuggling and 
related matters.

Â

Recommendation 5

Â

That priority be given to concluding arrangements with source and 
transit countries and strengthening international cooperation in combating 
people smuggling, and in particular:

Â

(a)Â further develop Australia’s cooperation and arrangements with 
China (particularly Fujian officials) to stop the departure of boats 
and the speedy   return of boat people;

(b)Â extend the arrangements 
with Indonesia and PNG on third country nationals attempting to enter 
Australia illegally and develop similar arrangements with New Zealand 
and the Solomon Islands with the objective of assisting with the removal 
of third country nationals from those transit nations before they enter 
Australia;

(c)Â similar arrangements 
to be developed with other source and transit countries, as appropriate, 
including Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and some Middle East countries;

(d)Â establish arrangements 
with the Solomon Islands and other neighbouring island states on providing 
information on possible unauthorised boats travelling to Australia; 
and

(e)Â AusAID and DIMA to 
actively review the scope for providing assistance to enhance the capacity 
of law enforcement and border control agencies in major transit countries 
to deal with illegal immigration.

Â

Recommendation 6

Â

That DIMA, in consultation with relevant agencies, provide material 
and technical assistance to law enforcement and other appropriate authorities 
in Indonesia and PNG to assist those countries with activities focussed 
on the detection, detention and removal of immigrants attempting to 
enter Australia illegally. The cost over four years will be in the order 
of $2 million.

Â

Recommendation 7

Â

That a high priority be accorded to conclusion of the People Smuggling 
Protocol to the draft UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime 
and its ratification be encouraged within our region and beyond.

Â

ACTION IN AUSTRALIA 
TO STRENGTHEN COASTAL SURVEILLANCE

Â

Recommendation 8

Â

That the footprint and intensity of Coastwatch’s 
aerial surveillance be extended through the lease of a further two Dash 
8 aircraft (with provision for double crewing and 4000hrs of operation 
per a  nnum 
for the two aircraft) and one twin-engine (Instrument Flight Rules rated) 
helicopter (with provision for 500hrs per annum) for use in the Torres 
Strait.

Â

[note: the aircraft and helicopter leases would be to 2004 to coincide 
with the expiry of the existing Coastwatch contracts for the provision 
of aerial surveillance aircraft and a helicopter. The first year includes 
$2m for 1000hrs additional flying time for the existing fleet, to cover 
the lead-time for the introduction of the two leased aircraft. Provision 
is also included for the lease of a radar maintenance unit and spares 
to provide enhanced support for the aircraft and four additional Coastwatch 
Competency Assessment and Training Officers (CATOs).

The cost over four years will be in the order 
of $85 million.]

Â

Recommendation 9

Â

That a National Surveillance Centre be established within Coastwatch 
in Canberra with enhanced electronic communications links, including 
with state agencies, and an internal capacity to analyse information 
received from agencies to better manage the national effort.

The cost over four years will be in the order of $20 million.

Â

Recommendation 10

Â

That secure satellite-based voice/data communications be established 
to cover the full extent of Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (AEEZ) 
and beyond, including the capacity for real time communication with 
coastal surveillance aircraft and ocean-going vessels.

The cost over four years will be in the order of $3 million.

Â

Recommendation 11

Â

That Coastwatch extend its surveillance to include more systematic 
coverage of the AEEZ in the Coral Sea area, through transit operations 
as required from neighbouring states such as PNG, the Solomon Islands, 
New Caledonia and Indonesia.

Â

Recommendation 12

Â

That Coastwatch’s profile be raised by separating it from Border 
Division within Customs and established as a group in its own right 
under a redesignated position of Director-General of Coastwatch, reporting 
directly to the CEO of the Australian Customs Service.

Â

Recommendation 13

Â

That the position of Director-General Coastwatch be filled through 
secondment of a serving uniformed Australian Defence Force (ADF) officer; 
and that the Defence officer selected for the role identify other secondment 
opportunities in Coastwatch and other relevant areas for filling by 
members of the Australian Defence Force.

Â

Recommendation 14

Â

That the links between Coastwatch and its clients be strengthened 
by the secondment to Coastwatch of the ADF Liaison Officer (ADFLO) position 
(currently in Sydney) and a DIMA liaison officer; that Coastwatch post 
a liaison officer to REEFCENTRE headquarters to liaise with Queensland 
authorities and to Defence’s Northern Command in Darwin to enhance 
links with Defence.

Â

Recommendation 15

Â

That Customs and DIMA, in consultation with relevant agencies, develop 
a National Protocol among Commonwealth agencies and with state and territory 
agencies to cover illegal landings on Australian territory, as an adjunct 
to offshore surveillance arrangements.

Â

Recommendation 16

Â

That in the lead-up to the expiry of the two major Coastwatch surveillance 
contracts in 2004, Coastwatch further investigate the capacity of emerging 
technologies to partly replace manned aerial surveillance.

Â

A STRONGER LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Â

Recommendation 17

Â

That comprehensive legislative amendments be introduced to further 
strengthen maritime investigatory and enforcement powers against both 
Australian and foreign flag vessels. The legislation to be amended includes 
the   Migration Act 1958, Customs Act 1901, Quarantine Act 1908, Fisheries 
Management Act 1991  and associated legislation.

Â

Recommendation 18

Â

That the Commonwealth introduce legislation to create a forfeiture 
regime in relation to all boats or vehicles used in connection with 
the smuggling of migrants to Australia. Within constitutional constraints, 
this would operate regardless of whether prosecution action were taken 
or a conviction obtained and penalties imposed. Such a scheme would 
result in the forfeiture of the vessel, vehicle or aircraft immediately 
upon its arrival in Australia with prohibited non-citizens on board. 
It would complement legislation to be considered by parliament on stronger 
penalties against people smuggling. Apart from the deterrence factor, 
such powers are necessary to enable derelict vessels to be disposed 
of quickly before they become a hazard to navigation. In the meantime 
full use should be made of s260 and s261 of the   Migration Act 1958  to have illegal vessel/aircraft 
detained and the   Proceeds of Crime Act 1987,  which enables 
an offender’s property to be forfeited if it can be shown that an 
offender has been enriched by migrant smuggling activities.
