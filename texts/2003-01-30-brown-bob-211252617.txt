Crean Has Already Resigned - Brown

Simon Crean has already resigned on Labor’s basic principles of social justice and  environmental sustainability, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

Senator Brown was responding to MR Crean’s call for former Labor MP Kris Hanna  to resign because he has left Labor.

“Kris Hanna is standing for the dumped ALP ethos of a fair-go for all comers,  including asylum seekers. He is the consistent party.

“Mr Crean’s support for Howard Government direction on critical issues like asylum  seekers, logging of old growth forests, private health funding, China’s occupation of  Tibet and the World Trade Organisation in each cases breaches the humanitarian or  environmental ideals common to progressive politics around the world.

“Mr Crean has already resigned and gone over to conservative politics,” Senator  Brown said.
