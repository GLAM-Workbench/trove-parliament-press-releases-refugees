KIERAN GILBERT:                    Minister Albanese thanks for joining us.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:          G’day Kieran, good to be with you.

KIERAN GILBERT:                    Thank you. I want to start with the very sad news of  this latest tragedy at sea, your response to that?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:          It is another human tragedy. We know that there  have been four bodies recovered, and there may well  be further people missing.



I want to pay tribute to those brave Australians who, in  difficult circumstances, assisted last night. And this is  a tragic reminder that we need to continue to adjust  policy, to work on a genuine regional solution with our  neighbours, that there is a huge human cost to the  risk of people getting on boats and we’ve seen that  unfortunately overnight.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    When you talk about the need to adjust policy, we  are expecting something from Mr Rudd over the next  couple of days. He has got to come up with something  doesn’t he to show you have a plan to slow the boat  arrivals.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          What we do know is that three word slogans are just  that, they’re slogans. You need genuine policy  adjustments.



We know the slogans won’t work, and we know that if  it was that simple, it would have happened. So we  need more thought to be put into the policy changes  than Mr Abbott is offering.

But this is a reminder again of why it is imperative that  we do all we can to stop people risking their lives.

The people smugglers’ business is a dreadful trade in  human misery and we need though at times like this  also to recognise, of course, the terrible tragedy for  the individuals who have lost their lives and for their  families who would be grieving today.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    You paid tribute to the personnel and the border  command, the naval personal on Warramunga and  HMAS Albany. One of the key arguments against  turning back boats has been the difficulty and the  risks involved for our naval personnel.



It can’t be much more risky though than the operation  we saw yesterday where they were forced to enter the  water risking their own lives in dangerous sea and  weather conditions?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          But this was a boat that capsized. What we’re talking  about is - and we know that it will happen, this policy  isn’t static - once people know that boats are going to  be turned back, guess what? They will be sabotaging  boats. We know that is what the response will be.



We know because that is what the naval personnel  tell us it will be. And it is the Navy themselves who  frankly are in a lot better position than you and I from  the comfort of Canberra and Sydney studios to judge  the risk.

And that is why the turn back the boats slogan - not  only is unacceptable to our friends and neighbours in  Indonesia - it also is unacceptable to those naval  personnel who have made their views very clear.  Common sense tells you that that’s the case.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    Do you accept on this issue, unlike the carbon tax for  example where Mr Rudd wasn’t Prime Minister when  that introduced, he was Prime Minister when this  Government dismantled the Howard Government  approach.



Does he have to take ownership of where this policy  and where this problematic and vexed issue is at the  moment?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          The fact is that this isn’t a full time siren after 80  minutes of the State of Origin tonight. This is a policy

area that needs constant adjustment because you  have adjustment from the people smugglers and they  change their model.



So when it comes to these difficult immigration issues,  it’s not a matter of putting something in concrete and it  stays that way forever. The Prime Minister has  acknowledged very clearly that there is a need for an  adjustment to the policy, and that is precisely what the  Government is working on.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    Okay, let’s move on to the issue of infrastructure.  Tony Abbott’s in Mackay this morning. He’s going to  announce the full funding of the upgrade of the Bruce  Highway over the next ten years; nearly $7 billion the  commonwealth contribution under this promise.



It appears it’s a much greater contribution than what  the Labor Government’s offered to it?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          This is smoke and mirrors, and I note that Tony  Abbott is making his press conference at the very  place where Federal Labor has put funding into the  highway; 100 per cent at that particular section of the  highway funded by the Federal Government, ignored  by the Coalition.



When the Coalition was last in office and Warren  Truss was the transport minister, they contributed  $1.3 billion over 12 long years. We’re putting $5.7  billion in over a similar period of time since we came  into office in 2007.

So four times the funding under Labor, people know  that that’s the case. And when you look at the detail,  it’s fine to say we’ve got a ten-year plan and all the  money is in year nine and year ten, and when we get  a fourth term Abbott Government we might get around  to doing something.

If you look at the funding in the forward estimates they  have $2.1 billion in their first four years. We  committed earlier this year to more than that; $2.25  billion over four years. We’ve been getting on with the  job of actually building the Bruce.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    Will you up your commitment now in response to this  though? Because the total amount that they’re  promising, from your own figures this morning, is  greater than what you’ve already got on the table.



So will you reconsider and step up the commonwealth  contribution?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          I tell you what, all they’ve done is take the money that  we’ve currently got in the budget - not our promises in  terms of the election campaign, which have not been  made - the money that we have currently in the  budget, they have taken that and said ‘oh we’ll call  that our own’.



Well that’s in the budget, fully budgeted for. And if you  look at the projects that they’ve listed they add up to  nothing like the amount of money that they’re talking  about. They add up to far less than that because all  they’ve done is take the projects that we announced  in April.

They’ve had six years to work on a policy, six years,  and in the weeks or months leading to an election  they’ve come up with a figure having done nothing,  committed nothing, and when they were last in  government, spent almost nothing on the Bruce  Highway.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    Alright. I want to talk about the automotive industry  now. They’re worried about this announcement  yesterday by Chris Bowen and Kevin Rudd that you’re  going to save $1.8 billion by tightening the rules  around fringe benefits, tax concessions for salaried  sacrificed vehicles.



It’s already an embattled industry, Mr Albanese, and  they want urgent talks to discuss this measure that  you’ve announced. It doesn’t sound like the new Rudd  Government, as much as you’ve promised greater  business consultation, that there was much  consultation on this one?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          This is a tax measure that will impact on those people  who are claiming a tax deduction based on 20 per  cent use of their vehicle provided by an employer, but  aren’t using it for 20 per cent. That’s all it is, that’s the  only change that’s there.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    But it’s $1.8 billion, it’s a lot that the auto industry  has got to cop.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:          There’s a lot of people clearly fiddling the system,  and let me tell you as I sit here in the Sydney CBD,

that those people who are salary sacrificing, who use  their car less than 20 per cent but claim the 20 per  cent offset - so less than one kilometre in every five  they actually use for work - the chances are it’s not a  Holden Commodore, it’s a BMW.



So in terms of the impact on the domestic industry,  the advice that we had in terms of where impact of  this will be, who the people are who are claiming this  deduction that they’re not entitled to, that they’re not  entitled to. If they use the vehicle for one kilometre in  every five, all they have to do is keep log books, or  keep the app for 12 weeks in every year and they still  get it.

The Henry Tax Review had a look at this, and I say  this to the Opposition, if they are slightly serious about  it, have a chat to Campbell Newman, Barry O’Farrell  and Denis Napthine and all their state government  people and tell them to actually put Australian flags in  their state government fleets. That single measure  would make a huge difference.

And don’t rip $500 million out of car assistance, which  is what Sophie Mirabella and Tony Abbott want to do  if they’re elected to government later this year.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    Finally I want to ask you about the emissions trading  scheme. Promises made yesterday, but Mr Abbott  says Kevin Rudd’s not the terminator he’s the  fabricator, there are doubts as to whether or not the  Government would be able to get it through the  parliament anyway even if you do win the election.



That the Greens remain opposed, and the Coalition  would remain opposed beyond the election, so there’s  no guarantee you would be able to legislate the  change anyway?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          Of course we’d get it through. Tony Abbott, we know  he wants to slug families $1200 to $1300 for his plans  so he can give incentives and breaks for big polluters,  that’s his plan. But for him to stand in the way of a  $380 improvement in living standards for the average  family would be an extraordinary position.



And as for the Greens - this mob, we would have had  a price on carbon earlier if they got on their feet,  walked across the chamber and voted for the

emissions trading scheme, which they voted against  twice in 2009.

What we’re talking about here is a move to an  emissions trading scheme, that’s always been Labor’s  policy, earlier. What that means as well is there’s a  cap on carbon pollution one year earlier than there  would have been otherwise.

Now if the Greens want to have that argument I’m  quite happy to because we’ve already as a nation  suffered setbacks in terms of dealing with climate  change because of the Greens’ intransigence.

Labor has a sensible policy. We’re not climate  sceptics like Tony Abbott who exposed himself the  other day. And we’re also not market sceptics like the  Greens in their opposition to an ETS.



KIERAN GILBERT:                    Mr Albanese, I appreciate your time today, thanks  very much. On a serious note dominating the thoughts  of many on the eastern seaboard, the Origin, you  confident of a Blues win?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:          I’m never confident of a Blues win versus  Queensland, but I think the teams’ done well. It’s  largely the same team’s been able to be kept together  this time. I think Paul Gallen is a big loss.



Who knows? Maybe Greg Inglis will remember where  he was from and don a blue jumper tonight. That  would really make a big difference!



KIERAN GILBERT:                    It certainly would. Mr Albanese I appreciate your  time, thanks very much.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:          See you Kieran. Enjoy the game tonight.
