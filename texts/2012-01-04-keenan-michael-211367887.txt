E&OE…………………………

Topics: Boat arrivals, stopping the boats, ACMA submission, Labor incompetence & Australia’s  detention network.

Luke Grant

We’ll get to Brendan O’Connor, who’s the acting Immigration and Citizenship Minister after 7:30 but  what I wanted to do now was have a chat to the Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship. As we know its new year’s time and the same old leaky boats keep setting out for  Australia, 51 passengers and 3 crew were aboard two boats picked up off Western Australia and the  Northern Territory on Monday - they’re joining the 863 asylum seekers being held on Christmas Island.  There were 69 boats throughout last year, bringing in just over 4,500 asylum seekers to our land - the  numbers were the biggest in the last two months of the year and - this is extraordinary - November  saw 11 boats and 892 arrivals, December another 11 with 854 arrivals, so its sound as though it’s very  much business as usual, Michael Keenan is the acting Shadow Minister and joins us on the line - Happy New Year Michael.

Michael Keenan

Happy New Year to you Luke and to your listeners too.

Luke Grant

Good to talk to you again, it does sound like business as usual here doesn’t it.

Michael Keenan

Absolutely and of course if Australia is not going to change its policy then we are going to continue to  get the exactly the same results and that’s why it is vitally important that Julia Gillard has as her first  priority for 2012 to do something about this self induced border protection crisis.

Luke Grant

Government members or at least the Minister, Mr Bowen, getting together with his opposite number  Scott Morrison and one or two others to have a conversation about how this policy could be fixed up - I  know on the day there was nothing announced that seemed all that positive - are you aware of any  progress that has been made in these negotiations?

Michael Keenan

I’m not aware of any progress in those negotiations but our position remains exactly the same, it was  the same 4 years ago when the Labor Party came to office, it was the same 3 years ago when they  abolished off shore processing and temporary protection visas. We need to go back to a suite of  policies that actually works and of course we know what works because we’ve implemented those  policies in Government. If we were to return to off-shore processing on the Island of Nauru - return to  temporary protection visas and actually turn the boats back around when it is safe and appropriate to  do so then we could actually smash people smuggling like we’ve done in the past.

Luke Grant

Yes and you can’t argue with the numbers when you left Government - I know this because Scott tells  me each time we talk, there were I think 4 people in detention and now that number is well and truly  over 6,000 isn’t it - I mean it just speaks for itself.

Michael Keenan

Yes - it’s empirically impossible to argue, the Labor Party came to office and this was a problem that  had been solved by the previous government and they applied the kiss of life to people smuggling and  ever since they’ve been back they’ve been back peddling and trying to find a policy solution to it - even  though of course we know what that solution is - but they just need to have the courage to embrace it.

Luke Grant

That’s right they do. Now Melbourne’s (inaudible) Centre - 187 grievances were lodged in the 15  months to March 25 last year, a quarter of them allege mistreatment and abuse. It’s not just the  problem that we’ve got people dying in their way to Australia; it’s what we do with them when they  come here. Are you satisfied with the system in that people who are ending up in detention are being  appropriately looked after and that the system works the way that it should?

Michael Keenan

Look I think that our detention network has a whole litany of problems and those problems are because  we are getting so many people arrive in it who know that the Labor Party’s policy is now to release  people into the community - although they can’t even do that at a fast enough rate to make up for all of  the people who are coming down. So we’ve got enormous pressure within the detention network just  by the sheer weight of the volume of people who are coming through and that gives us all of the  problems that we’ve seen in the past with violence and the riots that we’ve seen and the potential for  that to happen again whilst we’ve got a massively open and overcrowded network. It terms of the  treatment of people - certainly I’m on the detention network inquiry and as we’ve gone around the  country, I think that every effort is made to treat people as is appropriate when they arrive in Australia  and I think generally our facilities are second to none. I think those figures of 25 per cent of people

being miss-treated would seem extraordinarily high in my experience.

Luke Grant

And what about the way we deal with people who break the law when they’re in detention - for  example trying to burn down federal government property, assaulting others etc if my average listener  or I was undertaking that sort of behavior we could expect an appointment with the court and maybe  some time behind bars - it just seems to me that you never hear of any punishment being handed to  these people who think it’s ok to burn down federal government property for example.

Michael Keenan

It’s extraordinary - I think that it should be very clear that if you do something like that within a  detention network then you should never ever think that you are going to come to Australia. Sadly  under the Labor Party that’s exactly what will happen to you. The incidents that we’ve seen of violence  and riots - there hasn’t been prosecutions from the incidents like we would have expected and often  that is because there was just an inadequate ability to collect evidence - for instance because the  CCTV camera network wasn’t working properly and this is just an example of the gross incompetence  that we’ve seen in managing our immigration detention network and it’s the sort of thing that we’ve  been looking at in that enquiry - quite frankly Luke I think you and your listeners would be shocked by  the sorts of things that we’ve found.

weeks the ACMA in conjunction with the Immigration Department seem to be now putting forth a  condition for electronic broadcasters - particularly those that use cameras - that they can’t show or  they are discouraged from showing asylum seekers arriving or in detention given it might breach their  privacy and I’ve had a little trouble getting someone on from the department to talk about that although  I had a debate with a fellow called Sandy Logan on Twitter who seems to like that sort of thing - anyway it seems a bit odd that we’ve got victims of floods and other things in Australia that end up on  the 6 o’clock news but people who arrive here by boat get this special we can’t see your face  treatment - what’s that all about?

Michael Keenan

I think it’s more about the Labor Party’s political imperatives more than it is about protecting any  alleged right to privacy of asylum seekers - it’s just a typical response from the Labor Party. They think  if they do something to effect the media reporting of the problem then that will help them in dealing with  it when of course the heart of this problem is the policies that caused them the problem in the first  place. I don’t think it has a lot to do with anything apart from the Labor Party’s political imperatives and  look it’s not really up to the department of course they respond to what their political masters tell them  to so the submission that the immigration department made comes down to what the Labor Party  wants it to do and so they’re the people you should be pursuing about this Luke.

Luke Grant

Before I let you go, final question on the deal, is it going to be your attitude - that is the Coalition’s  attitude that it’s what worked before or nothing - is there any ground to be shared in for example  Malaysia?

Michael Keenan

We just don’t change our mind on these issues every 5 minutes - that’s the problem that we’ve had  which has led us to this impasse in Australia - we have a government that is constantly changing its  mind on border protection and sending this constant signal of weakness to people smugglers. Our  position is exactly the same - as it has been for a decade and I said we’d adopt that position because  we know that it actually works and if Labor wants a solution to the crisis that it’s created they would be  smart to adopt that position as well.

Luke Grant

Always go to talk to you Michael, thanks so much.

Michael Keenan

Nice to talk to you Luke

Luke Grant

Michael Keenan, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for  Justice Customs and Border Protection.
