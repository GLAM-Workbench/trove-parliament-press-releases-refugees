MINISTER IN VICTORIA 
FOR IMMIGRATION CONSULTATIONS

Â

The Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today said initiatives to 
attract more skilled migrants to Australia were having a significant 
impact in Victoria.

Â

In Melbourne as part 
of a national program of consultations on Australia’s 1999-2000 migration 
program, Mr Ruddock said the number of migrants coming to Victoria under 
the Skilled stream increased by almost 50 per cent in 1997-98 over the 
previous year.

Â

“The 1997-98   Settler Arrivals  statistical report shows that 4,537 people 
migrated to the state through the Skilled stream last year, up from 
3057 in 1996-97.

Â

“Australia is getting 
the expertise it needs, and the community can be confident the migration 
program is generating significantly more benefits for them.

Â

“The Government is 
committed to ensuring that skilled migration to Australia continues 
to improve, so all Australians can share in these benefits.

Â

"If Victoria would 
like to further increase its skilled migrant intake it should consider 
participating in initiatives such as the State and Territory Nominated 
Independent category”.

Â

In total, some 16,233 
migrants settled in Victoria in 1997-98 compared to 18,266 the previous 
year.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the   Settler Arrivals  
report also showed that:

Â

Â· Â Some 
34.3 per cent of all permanent settlers to Victoria entered under the 
Family Stream, down from 50 per cent last year.

Â· Â The 
Humanitarian Program accounted for 17.1 per cent of arrivals in Victoria, 
up from 16.7 per cent last year.

Â· Â The 
Non-Program migration category (mainly New Zealand citizens) attracted 
20.3 per cent of settlers, up on last year’s figure of 16.2 per cent

Â· Â Among 
the new settlers to Victoria were people from New Zealand (12.8%), the 
United Kingdom (8%), China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan) (6.6%), 
Vietnam (5.5%), and India (5%).

Â

Mr Ruddock said during 
this year’s consultations he will meet with a wide cross-section of 
individuals and organisations including representatives of business, 
economic, industry, union, environment, welfare, refugee, humanitarian 
and ethnic community groups.

Â

‘This is the first 
time that a nation-wide round of public meetings has been held on the 
migration program.

Â

“I trust this will 
provide a unique opportunity for many Australians to contribute their 
thoughts, ideas and comments on the size and composition of Australia’s 
immigration program”.

Consultations and public 
meetings are also being held in Albury-Wodonga, Griffith, Sydney Adelaide, 
Perth, Canberra, Brisbane, Cairns and Darwin, Launceston and Hobart.
