PAKISTAN: SENATOR EVAN~Ã¢Â‘ S /PRESS CONFERENCE: TRANSCRIPT

ATTACHED IS A~TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR EVANS PRESS CONFERENCE ON

21 MAY 1995 DURING HIS VISIT TO ISLAMABAD. THE TEXT OF THE QUESTIONS

IS NOT VERBATIM, BUT REFLECT THE SENSE OF THE QUESTION ONLY.

BEGINS

TRANSCRIPT OF A PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE HONOURABLE SENATOR

GARETH EVANS, Q. C. MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS Ã¢Â‘ ... '.

1 SENATOR EVANS - GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I'M

NEARING THE END OF A VERY FLEETING VISIT TO ISLAMABAD OF JUST 24

HOURS OR SO AS PART OF A ROUND INDIAN OCEAN TRIP THAT I'M DOING,

INVOLVING AMONG OTHER OTHER PLACES, INDIA AND SOUTH AFRICA AND SRI

LANKA AND SOME OF THE ISLAND COUNTRIES, IN PARTICULAR TO TALK ABOUT

THE SUBJECT OF INDIAN OCEAN REGIONAL COOPERATION. I THINK YOU'VE

BEEN GIVEN THE TEXT OF A SPEECH I GAVE IN DELHI A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

WHICH ~ILL INDICATE THE SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS OF THAT INTIATIVE AND

WHAT I~E ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. BUT MORE ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT.

DURING MY 24 HOURS HERE, THERE WERE SUBSTANTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH

PRESIDENT LEGHARI FOR SOMETHING LIKE AN HOUR THIS AFTERNOON AND WITH

PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES AND WITH OF

COURSE, THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SARDAR ASIF ALI AND A

NUMBER OF OTHER OFFICIALS. I HAVE ALSO TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO

UNVEIL A PLAQUE TO MARK THE COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW

AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSION CHANCERY ON THAT MAGNIFICENT SITE ON

CONSTITUTION AVENUE.

2 THE VARIOUS THEMES THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED DURING THIS VISIT I

THINK I CAN SUMMARISE AS FOLLO~S: FIRST OF ALL, IT IS THE BILATERAL

AUSTRALIA/PAKISTAN RELATIONSHIP WHICH WE ARE ALL AGREED IS IN VERY  GOOD SHAPE. CERTAINLY SO FAR AS THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE IS CONCERNED,

AS FAR AS OUR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP IS CONCERNED UNQUESTIONABLY,  ... /2

HOWEVER THERE IS SCOPE FOR ADDING CONSIDERABLY MORE WEIGHT AND

BALLAST TO THE RELATIONSHIP. THERE IS ONLY ABOUT $400 MILLION HORTH

OF TRADE BETWEEN US AT THE MOMENT, NOT A GREAT DEAL OF INVESTMENT

GIVEN THE SIZE OF OUR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIES, WE COULD DO A LOT BETTER

THAN THAT. IN MY DISCUSSIONS WE'VE IDENTIFIED, THE AREAS OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, THAT IS TO SAY POHER  PLANTS AND HABOURS, PORTS, ROAD SYSTEMS AND SO ON, AGRI-BUSINESS

RIGHT ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM, MINING BUSINESS AGAIN RIGHT ACROSS

THE WHOLE SPECTRUM. FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE ANOTHER AREA WHERE

AUSTRALIA HAS PARTICULAR EXPERTISE. A KEY THING TO SAY ABOUT THE

BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP IS THAT IT IS NOW POISED FOR TAKE-OFF  IN A HAY THAT SIMPLY HASN'T REALLY BEEN IN PLACE IN THE PAST. I

THINK WE HAVE CROSSED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WATERSHED THAT IN THE PAST

RATHER INHIBITED THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY FROM FULLY  APPRECIATING THE OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN PAKISTAN AND SIMILARLY I THINK  INHIBITED PAKISTANI BUSINESSMEN FROM FULLY APPRECIATING THE  OPPORTUNITIES IN AUSTRALIA GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER. ALSO ON THE

BILATERAL FRONT, I SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, CONCERNING A

FAMILY PLANNING PROJECT HHICH WE ARE CONTRIBUTING 34 MILLION RUPEES,  JUST OVER A MILLION DOLLARS U.S. TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO FRONTLINE  FAMILY PLANNING WORKERS IN RURAL VILLAGES AND TOWNS TO IMPROVE THEIR

CLIENTS OUTREACH COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY AND ALSO TO SPONSOR FAMILY  PLANNING ORIENTATION SEMINARS AND STUDY TOURS FOR IMMEDIATE PERSON NEL

AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO UPDATE THEM ON THE LATEST DEVELOP MENTS IN

THIS FIELD. THAT PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE

UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND.

3 ALSO WHILE HERE ANOTHER BILATERAL MATTER TO MENTION QUICKLY IS

THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSE NOH TO NEGOTIATING A CONCLUDED EXTRADITION

TREATY BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND PAKISTAN, WE JUST NEED ONE MORE VISIT TO

PAKISTAN BY AN AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION. I THINK HE CAN BED THAT DOWN

AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE NEGOTIATIONS ON

A TREATY ON MUTUAL ASSISTANCE ON CRIMINAL MATTERS. THAT'S A VERY

IMPORTANT NEW DIMENSION TO COOPERATION BETWEEN US.

4 SO FAR AS OTHER ISSUES DISCUSSED, BEFORE I COME TO THE REGIONAL

ONE, ISSUES OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO PAKISTAN INVOLVE OBVIOUSLY THE

SITUATION IN KASHMIR ABOUT HHICH I HAD QUITE AN EXTENDED DISCUSSION,

AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, WITH ALL THREE OF MY MAJOR INTERLOCUTORS.

AUSTRALIA'S POSITION ON KASHMIR IS ESSENTIALLY THIS: HE DEPLORE THE  DESTRUCTION OF THE CHARAR -I-SHARIF SHRINE, WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE  FOR THAT. WE EXTEND OUR SYMPATHY TO THE KASHMIR! PEOPLE AT THE LOSS

OF ONE OF THE MOST REVERED RELIGIOUS SHRINES IN THE NATION, OR IN THE

REGION. WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE WHOLE OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY

ABOUT THE CONTINUING UNREST AND VIOLENCE IN KASHMIR AND HE ARE

CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, WHEREVER THEY OCCUR AND

WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. HE URGE BOTH SIDES TO EXERCISE

RESTRAINT. WE DO SUPPORT A PROPERLY CONDUCTED POLITICAL PROCESS,  ... /3

THAT HAS RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN KASHMIR AND HOPE THAT SOMETHING

OF THIS KIND MIGHT EMERGE FROM CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS THERE BEING

DISCUSSED BY THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT. ESSENTIALLY,

HOWEVER, THE WHOLE QUESTION OF KASHMIR IS ONE THAT WE SEE AS ONE FOR

INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO RESOLVE BETWEEN THEM, PEACEFULLY AND AS SOON AS

POSSIBLE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE '72 SIMLA AGREE MENT.

5 SO FAR AS OTHER ISSUES, HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, WITH THE SUBJECT OF

A PARTICULAR HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN PAKISTAN ITSELF, THE POSITION  OF CHILDREN, CHILD LABOUR AND THE STATUS OF THE BLASPHEMY LAW

EXERCISE, QUESTIONS ABOUT RATIFICATION OF THE CONVENTION OF WOMEN,  ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED WITH PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO.  I'VE ALSO HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION WITH HER ABOUT THE SITUATION OF AUNG

SAN SUU KYI PRESENTLY UNDER HOUSE ARREST, OF COURSE, IN BURMA IN

MYANMAR, AN ISSUE ABOUT WHICH PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO IS PARTICULA RLY

CONCERNED AND WHICH I AM CONCERNED ABOUT AND HA VE BEEN TRYING TO

ASSIST A RESOLUTION OF IN OUR OWN PART OF THE WORLD.

6 JUST TWO GLOBAL RELATED ISSUES, A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY, AUSTRALIA'S CONCERN SHARED WITH THE  REST OF THE WORLD THAT INDIA AND PAKISTAN CAN STILL NOT FIND

THEMSELVES ABLE TO SIGN THAT TREATY EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NOW GOT A

SITUATION WHICH I THINK IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM TH AT IN WHICH THE

TREATY WAS ORIGINALLY BORN. THAT IS TO SAY THAT AT THE END OF THE

COLD WAR AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE MAJOR NUCLEAR PO WERS TO MOVE NOW

DOWN THE DISARMAMENT PATH. ALSO, THE RATHER OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK ON

THE QUESTION OF THE IMMINENT NEGOTIATION OF THE CUT-OFF CON VENTION TO

STOP THE FURTHER PRODUCTION OF FISSILE MATERIAL WHICH I AM GLAD TO

SEE PAKISTAN SUPPORTING. THE QUESTION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN

IS NOW REASONABLY IMMINENT, I THINK, AND THERE'S ALSO A NU MBER OF

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS LIKE NEGATIVE SECURITY ASSURANCES THAT HAVE BEEN

GIVEN BY THE NUCLEAR POWERS WHICH I BELIEVE MAKE IT NO LONGER REALLY

POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT THE NPT IS DISCRI MINATORY AND IN APPROPRI ATE SO

FAR AS COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND PAKISTAN ARE CONCER NED, IF INDEED IT

WAS EVER APPROPRIATE TO TRY AND MAKE THAT CASE. A PARTICULAR

QUESTION ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THAT IS TH AT OF MISSILE PROLIFERATION  AND WHILE IN INDIA I EXPRESSED MY GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN ABOUT THE

POSSIBLE IMMINENT DEPLOY MENT OF PRITHVI MISSILES WHICH WE WOULD SEE

SERIOUSLY DESTABLISING AND WHICH WE EXPRESSED A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT,

EQUALLY HERE IN PAKISTAN I'VE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBLE

UTILISATION OF MISSILE TECHNOLOGY AND MISSILES ACQUIRED FROM CHINA  AND THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT NEITHER COUNTRY PLUNGES DOWN THAT PATH OF

MISSILE PROLIFERATION. IT'S A PARTICULARLY ACUTE ISSUE AT THIS STAGE.

7 ON THE QUESTION NOW OF INDIAN OCEAN REGIONAL COOPERATION. IT IS

A LARGE AND COMPLICATED QUESTION, I DON'T WANT TO SAY TOO MUCH BY WAY

OF INTRODUCTION, I WILL RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE,

EXCEPT TO SAY THIS. I THINK THE MAIN NEED AT THIS STAGE IS SIMPLY TO

HAVE A FULL EXPLORATORY DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE OPTIONS FOR SUCH

COOPERATION MIGHT BE RIGHT ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF ECONOMIC

COOPERATION. COOPERATION IN THE AREA OF TRANSNATIONAL PROBLEMS, LIKE  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ISSUES, THAT CROSS-NATIONAL BORDERS, ISSUES  OF NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, HEALTH PROBLEMS, REFUGEES,  DISPLACED PERSONS, QUESTIONS OF THAT KIND AND THIRDLY OF COURSE,

SECURITY QUESTIONS, WHAT MIGHT USEFULLY BE ABLE TO BE DONE IN

PARTICULAR BY WAY OF CREATING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION A SECURITY

DIALOGUE PROCESS OF THE KIND THAT HAS BECOME FAMILIAR ELSEWHERE.

8 WITH ALL THAT THOUGHT IN MIND ABOUT THE NEED TO GENERATE

DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS, AUSTRALIA WILL BE HOSTING IN PERTH NEXT MONTH

A BIG FORUM TO DISCUSS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY, ALL THOSE ISSUES BUT

PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATING ON THE ECONOMIC ONES AS YOU WOULD EXPECT

TO WHICH HAVE BEEN INVITED PARTICIPANTS FROM 29 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES  NAMELY ALL THOSE WHOSE BORDERS IN ANY WAY TOUCH UPON THE IND IAN

OCEAN, THE INDIAN OCEAN INCLUDING THE GULF AND THE BOTTOM END OF THE

RED SEA. FAIRLY ARBITRARY DEFINITIONS ARE INVOLVED IN THESE MA TTERS

BUT BASICALLY YOU TRY TO BE INCLUSIVE RATHER THAN ANY WAY SELECTIVE.

AND, WE HOPE THAT THE PARTICIPATION OF THREE CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE,

THAT IS TO SAY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY,  REPRESENTATIVES OF NON GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS, IN PARTICULAR  RESEARCH INSTITUTES, THINK TANKS, SENIOR ACADEMICS AND THIRDLY  REPRESENTATIVES OF GOVERNMENTS BUT NOT ACTING IN THEIR OFFICIAL  CAPACITY, ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE IN THEIR PERSONAL CAPACITY, WE HOPE  THAT THAT COMBINATION OF PEOPLE FROM THAT COMBINATION OF COUNTRIES

WILL GENERATE SOME HELPFUL AND USEFUL IDEAS THAT WILL TAKE FORWARD

THE MOMENTUM TO GENUINELY ESTABLISH SOME REGIONAL DIALOGUE.

9 IN A REGION WHERE SOUTH AFRICA IS BACK FROM OUT OF DARKNESS TO

NOW BECOME A PARTICIPATING COUNTRY, WHERE THE COLD WAR IS OVER AND

WITH IT A LOT OF THE HANGUPS AND CONCERNS THAT INHIBITED COOPERATION

IN THE PAST AND WHERE ON THE SUB-CONTINENT THERE IS A NEW APPROACH TO

ECONOMIC POLICY WHICH IS MUCH MORE OUTWARD LOOKING THAN IN THE PAST,

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRE-CONDITIONS ARE THERE FOR MUCH MORE OF A SENSE

OF COOPERATION AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

10 I THINK THAT JUST ABOUT EXHAUSTS THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN WE

HAVE DEALT WITH. THE SUBJECT OF CRICKET YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IS A

RECURRING MOTIF IN MOST OF MY TALKS WITH THE THOUGHT BEING THAT WE

HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO WHEN THE

PAKISTAN TEAM VISITS AUSTRALIA LATER THIS YEAR, IN PARTICULAR TO  ESTABLISH BEYOND ANY SHRED OF ANY POSSIBLE REMAINING DOUBT THAT WE

ARE IN FACT WORLD CHAMPIONS HAVING NOW BEATEN THE WEST INDIES.

PAKISTANIS MIGHT HAVE SOME SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT THAT BUT

I'M SURE IN THE FINEST TRADITION OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WE CAN

RESOLVE THEM ADEQUATELY.

11 QUESTION - WHAT WILL AUSTRALIA DO TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE UN

RESOLUTIONS ON KASHMIR ARE PUT INTO EFFECT.

12 SENATOR EVANS - WELL OUR VIEW ALONG WITH MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS

THAT ESSENTIALLY THOSE ORIGINAL RESOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN RATHER  OVERTAKEN BY THE SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF EVENTS AND THAT THE QUESTION OF

THE FUTURE OF KASHMIR IS A QUESTION THAT IS BEST RESOLVED BY

APPROPRIATE NEGOTIATIONS, DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. THE  FACT THAT THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS HAVING NO BORNE FRUIT SO

FAR AFTER MANY LONG YEARS OF TRYING THERE IS NO PARTICULAR REASON TO

BELIEVE THAT SOME RESOLUTION OF THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. I JUST AM NOT

PERSUADED THAT ANY FORM OF MULTILATERAL PROCESS OR OTHER MEDIATION

WOULD NECESSARILY ADVANCE MATTERS FURTHER. I DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE

COMPLEXITY, THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SITUATION THE PROBLEM THAT ARISES  BECAUSE THE THING IS SUCH A POLITICALLY CHARGED ISSUE SO FAR AS THE

PUBLICS OF BOTH COUNTRIES ARE CONCERNED AND THE WAY IT GETS MIXED UP

WITH PARTY POLITICS, ALL MAKES THIS VERY VERY COMPLEX. AUSTRALIA HAS

NO INSTANT SOLUTIONS I'M AFRAID TO HELP ADVANCE THE MATTER EITHER IN

TERMS OF PROCESS OR SUBSTANCE. ULTIMATELY, AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

BELIEVE THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE TO WORK THIS ONE OUT

BETWEEN THEMSELVES. I HAVE TO SAY JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT HOWEVER,

THAT HAVING SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER THE YEARS AND AGAIN THE LAST

COUPLE OF DAYS OF DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE WITH SENIOR LEADERS, DECISION

MAKERS BOTH IN INDIA AND IN PAKISTAN, I AM PERSUADED THAT THERE IS A

HIGH LEVEL OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO THE

RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE. THERE IS A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE, THERE IS A

LOT OF MORAL COMMITMENT TO GETTING A DECENT SOLUTION OUT OF ALL THIS

THAT WE WORK FOR THE KASHMIR! PEOPLE AND I HONESTLY THINK THAT YOU'VE

JUST TO STICK AT IT AND TRY TO FIND THAT ELUSIVE COMMON GROUND.

YES??

13 QUESTION- INDIA'S BLUE WATER NAVY IS A THREAT TO THE COUNTRIES

OF THE REGION. WHAT ARE AUSTRALIA'S VIEWS ON THE INDIAN NAVAL

BUILD-UP?

14 SENATOR EVANS - WELL I THINK THAT'S CONSIDERABLY OVERSTATED.  THERE WAS SOME CONCERN EXPRESSED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT INDIA'S

ACQUISITION OF A BLUE WATER NAVAL CAPABILITY SEEMED TO BE RUNNING

WELL AHEAD OF ANY DISCERNIBLE SELF DEFENCE NEED AND WAS

DISPROPORTIONATE TO ANY REASONABLE ASSESSMENT OF THOSE NEEDS. THAT

CONCERN WAS EXPRESSED BY QUITE A FEW COUNTRIES IN THE REGION NOT JUST

PAKISTAN BUT I THINK IN MORE RECENT YEARS I'VE NOT HEARD THAT CONCERN

EXPRESSED. THERE'S BEEN SOME CONSIDERABLE TRIMMING BACK OF

EXPENDITURE AS A RESULT OF BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AND SO ON IN THE

INDIAN SYSTEM AND WE FRANKLY DON'T SEE ANY PARTICULAR CAUSE FOR

CONCERN IN THAT RESPECT. WHEN YOU SAY THE ONLY NAVAL POWER, I THINK

THAT UNDERESTIMATES AUSTRALIA'S NAVAL CAPACITY BUT I'M NOT GOING TO

GET INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. WE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NAVAL POWER

OURSELVES WITH BOTH THE SURFACE AND UNDERWATER CAPACITY, AS YOU

EXPECT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE CONTINENT WE HAVE TO DEFEND. ANY

COUNTRY THAT HAS GOT A SIGNIFICANT COASTLINE DOES JUST HAVE TO TAKE

THE PRECAUTIONS IN THAT RESPECT AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNTS OF

THE POSSIBLE THREATS. THREATS ARE A FUNCTION OF INTENTION PLUS

CAPABILITY. INTENTIONS ARE NOT OBVIOUS, WE DON'T PERCEIVE THEM AS

THREATS OR RISK TO US IN TERMS OF ANYONE'S INTENTION AT THE MOMENT

BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY PLENTY OF COUNTRIES IN OUR WHOLE RANGE OF

GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS WHO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO IMPACT UPON US SO WE'VE

GOT A DEFENSIVE CAPABILITY ACCORDINGLY.

15 QUESTION - WHY ARE YOU NEGOTIATATING AN EXTRADITION TREATY AT

THIS TIME. IS THERE A PARTICULAR PERSON YOU WISH TO EXTRADITE?

16 SENATOR EVANS - WELL, THERE IS NO PARTICULAR IMMEDIATE NEED BUT

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING WHICH BOTH

COUNTRIES SHARE AND AS WELL IN THE CONTEXT OF A CONCERN GENERALLY TO

ENSURE THAT CRIMINALS DON'T ESCAPE THEIR JUST DESSERTS WHEREVER THEY  MIGHT CHOOSE TO RUN TO, WE ARE JUST EMBARKING UPON THE KIND OF TREATY

THAT BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE WITH MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

I MEAN TO BE REALLY SUCCESSFUL EXTRADITION TREATIES HAVE TO BE PRETTY

WELL UNIVERSAL IN THEIR SCOPE. EVERY COUNTRY WITH EVERY OTHER

COUNTRY . WE'RE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF BEDDING DOWN THIS TO COMPLETE

THE RANGE OF OUR COVERAGE BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PARTICULAR CONTEXT

IN WHICH IT HAS THE MOST IMMEDIATE LIKELY APPLICATIONS OF NARCOTIC

TRAFFICKING BECAUSE THAT REMAINS A PROBLEM AS WELL ALL KNOW IN THIS

PART OF THE WORLD. YES?

17 QUESTION -FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON INDIAN NAVY.

18 SENATOR EVANS- PLEASE DON'T MISQUOTE ME WHEN WHAT I SAID ABOUT

BLUE WATER NAVY IS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF HHAT YOU ATTRIBUTEb TO ME

THAT WE DON'T SEE THA T AS IN ANY WAY A PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH A FEW

YEARS AGO PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE CONCERNED. IN SO FAR AS MISSILE

DEPLOYMENT IS CONCERNED, YES, THERE IS A POTENTIAL THREAT TO REGIONAL  SECURITY, NOT LEAST BECAUSE ANY DEPLOYMENT OF THAT KIND TENDS TO

TRIGGER OFF A RECRIPROCAL RESPONSE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, NOT LEAST OF

COURSE, PAKISTAN ITSELF. AND, I THINK IT IS AN UTTERLY UNATTRACTIVE  PROSPECT TO GO DOHN THAT PARTICULAR PATH, JUST AS IT WAS AN UTTERLY

UNATTRACTIVE PROSPECT BACK IN THE 70'S FOR BOTH COUNTRIES TO GO DOWN

THE PATH OF DEVELOPING NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES. IT'S SOMETHING I THINK  THAT BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE BETTER OFF NOT HAVING DONE AND THE WORLD

WOULD CERTAINLY BE BETTER OFF IF THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED. YES, OF

COURSE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, IT BUT I DON'T SEE THE PARTICULAR KIND

OF SECURITY DIALOGUE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

DISCUSSING IN PERTH AS GETTING DOWN TO THAT DEGREE OF DETAIL ABOUT

PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SECURITY PROBLEMS BETWEEN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES.  I THINK TO TRY AND DEBATE THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES AT THIS EARLY STAGE

OF THE PROCESS WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE . WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING

TO DO IN THE PERTH FORUM IS TO JUST GET IDEAS GOING ABOUT WHAT KIND

OF DIALOGUE PROCESSES MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE ESTABLISHED COULD OVER THE

LONGER TERM HELP TO IMPROVE TRUST AND IMPROVE CONFIDENCE AND PERHAPS

CREATE A MORE BENIGN AND MORE LONG LASTING SECURITY ENVIRONMENT. AND

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, NOT

ONLY HAVE WE CREATED APEC AS THE BODY WITH AN ECONOMIC BRIEF TO

DEVELOP COOPERATIVE STRATEGIES, WE'VE ALSO, LAST YEAR, JUST  ESTABLISHED THIS ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER THE 18

MAJOR COUNTRIES OF THE WHOLE ASIA PACIFIC REGION TO DISCUSS SECURITY

ISSUES IN THE WAY THAT I'VE JUST MENTIONED, TRUST AND

CONFIDENCE-BUILDING STRATEGIES, PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY, PEACE BUILDING,  THINGS OF THAT KIND. IT WILL BE SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME, IF EVER,

BEFORE WE GET TO THE POINT OF ADDRESSING IN A CONFLICT MANAGEMENT

SENSE OR A CONFLICT RESOLUTION SENSE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS  BUT I BELIEVE NONETHELESS IT CAN STILL BE VALUABLE TO GO DOWN THIS

KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL PATH. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

YES?

19 QUESTION - GIVEN THE ENORMOUS DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES  OF THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SO LITTLE IN

COMMON WHY DO YOU THING THAT AN INDIAN OCEAN REGIONAL GROUPING IS

FEASIBLE?

20 SENATOR EVANS- WELL, I THINK THAT'S MUCH TOO PESSIMISTIC A VIEW

OF THE WORLD WITH RESPECT. TAKE THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, FOR

EXAMPLE, AND CONSIDER SOME OF THE DISPARITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

THE MEMBERSHIP OF THAT PARTICULAR BODY, APEC. YOU'VE GOT DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES LIKE PAPUA NEW GUINEA ALONGSIDE THE UNITED STATES, CHINA  AND JAPAN. HUGE DISPARITIES OF POPULATION, HUGE DISPARITIES OF  INCOME AND HUGE DISPARITIES ALONG THE DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM. BUT

NONETHELESS WE'VE FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO FIND COMMON GROUND IN AREAS

LIKE ECONOMIC COOPERATION, MORE BROADLY DEFINED, HUMAN RESOURCE  DEVELOPMENTS, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE NETWORKING, DATA  COMPILATION AND EXCHANGE LIKE THE OECD DOES, POLICY DIALOGUE ON

MACROECONOMIC ISSUES, DISCUSSION OF ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND  PATTERNS, COMMON PROJECTS IN AREAS OF INFRASTRUCTURE,  TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORT AND SO ON . THEN WE HAVE MOVED UP FROM

THERE, THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED, TO DISCUSS THINGS LIKE, OR TO

NEGOTIATE THINGS LIKE COMMON TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN KEY

COMMODITIES THAT ARE WIDELY TRADED IN THE REGION TO REDUCE THE COSTS

OF THEM GOING INTO PARTICULAR MARKETS. COMMON SYSTEMS OF

CERTIFICATIONS SO THAT YOU CERTIFY TECHNICAL STANDARDS IN ONE PLACE  AND APPLIES ELSEWHERE, COMMON SYSTEMS OF CUSTOMS PROCEDURES TO MAKE

EASIER THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND SO ON, AND WE'RE ABOUT TO MOVE UP TO

A THIRD TIER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY WHICH IS TRADE INVESTMENT  LIBERALISATION-1 ADDRESSING ISSUES LIKE TARIFFS AND QUOTAS AND  NON-TARIFF BARRIERS TO TRADE. NOW, ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE

AND WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE IN A VERY VERY

HETEROGENEOUS REGION LIKE THE ASIA PACIFIC. NOW, OF COURSE IN THE

ASIA PACIFIC THERE IS ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT MEASURE OF INTEGRATION  BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ECONOMIES WHEN APEC WAS STARTED THERE WAS ABOUT

60 PERCENT OF TRADE WAS INTRA REGIONAL TRADE, THE AMOUNT OF TRADE

THAT WAS GOING ON THAT WAS INTRA-REGIONAL IN CHARACTER WAS ABOUT 60

PERCENT NOW ABOUT 66 PERCENT. IN THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION AS WE'VE

DEFINED IT BY COMPARISON IT'S ONLY ABOUT 20 PERCENT AT THE MOMENT,

BUT CONSIDER THIS, IT'S ONLY JUST VERY VERY RECENTLY THAT SOUTH

AFRICA HAS COME BACK INTO THE PICTURE. BEFORE THAT WE ALL HAD

SANCTIONS AGAINST THEM, AND TRIED NOT TO TRADE WITH THEM AT ALL.

IT'S ONLY JUST SINCE 1991 THAT INDIA, WITH ALL IT'S HUGE POPULATION  AND THE SIZE OF IT'S ECONOMY, HAS LOOKED OUTWARD AT ALL AND HAS

WANTED TO TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH ANYBODY. PAKISTAN'S BEEN IN THE

OPEN ECONOMY BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT LONGER, INDIA'S ONLY JUST COME

FRESH TO THAT, SO IT'S HARDLY TO BE UNEXPECTED THAT THESE PATTERNS

HAVEN'T REALLY DEVELOPED. WE IN AUSTRALIA HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING MUCH

NOTICE, CERTAINLY NOT OF SOUTH AFRICA, CERTAINLY NOT OF THE

SUB-CONTINENT, WE'VE TRIED AND FAILED TO PENETRATE THAT SORT OF

MARKET IN THE PAST. BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW PSYCHOLOGY ABROAD AND I

THINK EFFORTS LIKE THIS CREATE A SENSE OF REGIONAL IDENTITY, WHICH  ARE GOING ON ALL OVER THE WORLD: IN THE ECO AREA INVOLVING

PAKISTAN,THE ASIA/PACIFIC, IN EUROPE

ONLY THE OAU BUT THE SADC, SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION,

ALL OF THIS BUBBLE OF ACTIVITY IS GOING ON. IF YOU LOOK BACK HUNDREDS

OF YEARS TO THE PRE-COLONIAL ERA, THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

INTEGRATION OF THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION AND TRADE WITH EACH OTHER. IN

THE COLONIAL PERIOD THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES WERE TREATED AS MINES DR

QUARRIES DR SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO FEED DIRECTLY INTO THE

EUROPEAN COLONIAL MASTERS' MARKETS AND SO ON, THERE WASN'T MUCH

CROSS-REGIONAL TRADE. BUT WE CAN RECREATE SOME OF THAT. THE

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SUB-CONTINENT AND THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IS  STARTING TO DEVELOP VERY RAPIDLY, SO IT MAY BE THAT THIS CAN'T BE

CREATED, MAYBE THAT THIS IS ARTIFICIAL, MAYBE IT'S AN IDEA WHOSE TIME

HAS NOT YET COME BUT LET'S AT LEAST BEGIN THE TASK OF EXPLORING IT

BECAUSE THERE ARE POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR US ALL IF THIS DOES IN FACT

TAKE OFF. YES?

21 QUESTION - A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON KASHMIR

22 SENATOR EVANS- I THINK I'VE ANSWERED THE QUESTION ON KASHMIR

BOTH IN WHAT I SAID ORIGINALLY AND WHAT I SAID SUBSEQUENTLY AS BEST

AS I CAN. I KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS IS A PRE-OCCUPATION IN

THIS COUNTRY AND I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS ALSO A PRE-OCCUPATION IN

DELHI TOO AND I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN I'M SAYING HERE AND

THAT'S ABOUT IT.

25 QUESTION- WHAT WAS THE PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT'S REACTION TO YOUR

INDIAN OCEAN PROPOSAL?

26 SENATOR EVANS - CLEARLY AFFIRMATIVE. VERY AFFIR MATIVE, VERY

POSITIVE AND THE GOVERNMENT INDICATED THAT IT WAS KEEN TO PARTICIPATE

IN OUR PERTH FORUM AND TO CONTRIBUTE ACTIVELY AND POSTIVELY IN THIS

EXPLORATION EXERCISE ON WHICH WE ARE ABOUT . I WAS VERY PLE ASED WITH

THE REACTION FROM THE GOVERN MENT AT ALL LEVELS- THE PRESIDE NT, THE

PRIME MINISTER, FOREIGN MINISTER, DOWN. THERE IS AN ENTHUSIAM TO

EXPLORE THIS.

27 QUESTION - GIVEN THAT PAKISTAN AND INDIA ARE UNABLE TO COOPERATE

ON ANY MATTERS UNTIL THE KASHMIR ISSUE IS SETTLED W HY DO YOU THINK

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AT THE INDIAN OCEAN CON FENCE?

28 SENATOR EVANS- WELL, THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE IT'S ONLY JUST LESS

THAN TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE SAARC MEETING THAT THE COUNTRIES OF THIS

REGION, INCLUDING INDIA AND PAKISTAN, WERE ABLE TO AGREE AT LAST ON

THE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF ARRANGEMENTS OF SA PTA . OK THAT'S AN ISSUE

THAT'S BEEN IN THE PIPELINE FOR A LONG TIME, IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE

MOUNTAINS. THE RECIPROCAL TARIFF CONCESSIONS THAT WERE INVOLVED HERE  WERE NOT MAJOR, BUT IT'S A DEMONSTRATION THAT NOT WITHSTANDING ALL THE

TENSION AND ALL THE DRAMA AND ALL THE DIFFICULTY THAT'S GOING ON

ABOUT KASHMIR AT THE MO MENT, WHICH IS VERY HEIGHTENED AT THE MO MENT,

NONETHELESS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES TO AGREE ON

SOMETHING THAT RELATES TO COOPERATIVE STRATEGIES AND EVERYBODY'S  LARGER INTERESTS. SO I THINK THAT'S JUST ONE EXA M PLE OF WH AT IS

POSSIBLE. MOREOVER, YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THE OTHER WAY. MAYBE IF YOU

CAN BUILD UP CONFIDENCE BY GETTING MORE AND MORE AREAS OF COOPERATION

MOVING IN NO N-SENSITIVE AREAS, MAYBE IT BECO MES THAT MUCH EASIER THEN

TO ADDRESS IN A SYSTEMATIC AND HARD-HE ADED WAY SO ME OF THE REALLY

SENSITIVE ISSUES RATHER THAN JUST RETREATING TO YOUR RESPECTIVE  TRENCHES.

29 QUESTION - IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE TO HELP RESOLVE

SECURITY ISSUES IN THE REGION?

30 SENATOR EVANS - THAT'S A FRINGE BENEFIT. IT'S NOT THE BASIC

OBJECTIVE.

BEEN AS POTENTIALLY DRACONIAN IN THEIR IMPACT AS THE ONES THAT HAVE

BEEN IN PLACE HERE FOR THE LAST DECADE OR SO. I DON'T WANT TO TELL

YOU WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IN THIS RESPECT BECAUSE THAT'S A

MATTER FOR HER TO SAY, NOT FOR ME TO REPORT, BUT SHE GAVE ME AN

ACCOUNT OF THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO

TO MOVE THAT PROCESS WITHIN THE PARLIAMENT FORWARD AND EXPLAIN SOME

OF THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS THAT WERE AT WORK ON THE SUBJECT. BEYOND

THAT I'VE GOT NO FURTHER COMMENT.

33 QUESTION: WHAT DID THE PRIME MINISTER TELL YOU?

34 SENATOR EVANS - IT WAS A HELPFUL EXPLANATION WHICH MADE ME

UNDERSTAND MUCH BETTER WHAT IS GOING ON. BEYOND THAT I THINK IT IS

UP TO YOU TO TRY AND EXTRACT THAT INFORMATION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER

- NOT TO GET IT FROM ME OK. THERE ARE CERTAIN CONVENTIONS ABOUT

THESE THINGS.

35 QUESTION: FOLLOW UP ON THE BLASPHEMY LAW

36 SENATOR EVANS- I THINK IT IS REASONABLY SELF EVIDENT ISN'T IT,

IN TERMS OF RECENT EVENTS. I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MORE

TIME ON THAT. IT'S A SENSITIVE AND DIFFICULT ISSUE WITHIN THIS  COUNTRY AND OPINIONS ARE VERY STRONGLY HELD, BUT IT IS A QUESTION OF

UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE INVOLVED AND THERE OUGHT TO BE A

CAPACITY TO SPEAK REASONABLY FREELY AND ANY LAWS THAT APPLY IN THIS

AREA, AND WHILE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE SOME

LAWS AT ALL, NONETHELESS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT LAWS NOT BE

DRACONIAN AND EXCESSIVE IN THEIR IMPACT.

37 FURTHER QUESTION ON BLSASPHEMY LAW

38 SENATOR EVANS

39 QUESTION - DIEGO GARCIA IS THE LAST REMENANT OF COLONIALISM.

40 SENATOR EVANS - THE LAST REMNANTS OF COLONIALISM? THAT'S A BIT

HEAVY I THINK. I MEAN, DIEGO GARCIA IS A NAVAL BASE LEASED BY THE

UNITED STATES BASICALLY FROM THE BRITISH IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. TO

SOME EXTENT IT'S A PRODUCT OF THE COLD WAR YEARS. BUT NONETHELESS IT

HAS ASSUMED A CONTINUAL SIGNIFICANCE AND UTILITY AS A BASING STATION  AND A TRANSIT POINT AND SO ON FOR US FORCES IN THE GULF AND IN THE

PACIFIC AND ELSEWHERE. AND, WE, I THINK TAKE THE BASIC VIEW THAT

WE'VE ALREADY BEEN IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT OF AN INDIAN OCEAN ZONE

OF PEACE, BUT THE MATTER IN ISSUE ABOUT FOREIGN PRESENCES IN THE

REGION HAS BEEN WHETHER THOSE FOREIGN PRESENCES ARE DESTABLISING IN

CHARACTER. I MEAN THAT'S BEEN REALLY WHAT THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN

ABOUT FOR MOST OF THE LAST DECADE OR MORE AND AUSTRALIA WOULD TAKE

THE VIEW THAT THE US PRESENCE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AT THE DIEGO

GARCIA, WHATEVER ELSE YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SAY ABOUT IT, IS NOT A

DESTABLISING PRESENCE AND FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD NOT TAKE ANY

OBJECTION TO IT. WE THINK SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

TAKEN TO IT BY SOME OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION ARE PERHAPS A

LITTLE OVERDRAWN AND A LITTLE MUCH OF A REFLECTION OF SOME OF THE

HEIGHTENED PASSIONS OF THE COLD WAR YEARS AND WE OUGHT TO ALL BE ABLE

T 0 BE A LITTLE M 0 R E RELAXED A B 0 U T IT THESE DAYS. BUT I ME AN , I

UNDERSTAND IT'S AN ISSUE ABOUT WHICH STRONG OPINIONS ARE HELD AND THE

SITUATION IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE RAPIDLY.

41 QUESTION: WILL KASHMIR BE INVITED TO THE INDIAN OCEAN CONFERENCE?

42 SENATOR EVANS - I THINK YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT KASHMIR IS TAKEN

TO BE A PART OF INDIA AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S NOT AN INDEPENDENT

COUNTRY IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND AS SUCH IT WOULD BE QUITE INAPPROPRIATE

UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE SEEKING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THERE.

43 QUESTION - SO YOU CONSIDER KASHMIR IS A PART OF INDIA

44 SENATOR EVANS - WELL, THAT IS HARDLY NEWS I THINK FOR YOU TO

APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S THE WAY MOST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

THINKS ABOUT IT.

45 JOURNALIST: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (JOURNALIST RISES AND BEGINS TO

WALK OUT.)

46 COMMENT BY A JOURNALIST TO SENATOR EVANS - INAUDIBLE.

47 SENATOR EVANS TO JOURNALIST AS CONFERENCE BREAKS UP: OBVIOUSLY

THERE'S A DISPUTE INVOLVED OVER THE ISSUE OF KASHMIR PENDING

RESOLUTION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.
