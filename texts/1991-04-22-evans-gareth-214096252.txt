AUSTRALIA. THE ASIA PACIFIC AMD HONG ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Address by the Minister for Foreign Affaire and Trade of  Australia, Senator Gareth Evans, to the Hong Kong Foreign

Correspondents Club, 22 April 1991.

An audience of foreign correspondents in Bong Kong is unlikely

to contest the proposition that no country can escape its

geography. But some of us take a long time to come to terms  with the full consequences of our geography. For many decades

Australia thought of itself as a European outpost, and did  nothing to encourage our regional neighbours to think

otherwise. Knowing the importance of a good blood line,

graziers sent their eldest sons to England to scout put their

wives; the first overseas trip of Australians generally was

always to Europe to drink at the well-springs or Western

culture; our foreign policy consisted in keeping the! seamless

web of the British Empire together because it aldne would  protect us in our isolation and vulnerability; and when the

British could no longer do the job, it was the other "great

and powerful friend", the United States, to whom we turned to

provide physical and mental reassurance.

But things have changed, and they have changed dramatically.  We now do business extensively with the Asia Pacific? we take  more immigrants from Asia than from Europe; our tourists are

increasingly spending time in the region's holiday

destinations; our diplomatic focus is well and truljy or our

neighbourhood; and, most importantly of all the whole cultural

mindset of the nation is gradually changing ps well.

Australians think of themselves these days not as being in a

transplanted piece of Europe, but in the Asia Pacific,

There are four key elements of deliberate government policy in

that transformation. In the first place, since the early

1970s we have practiced a wholly non-discxjiminatory

immigration policy, and the proportion of Asian members of the

XZT /Q1

3

Australian community - not least from Kong Kong - is steadily

growing as a result.

Secondly# throughout the 1980s we have been reshaping our

economy, breaking down protectionist barriers, and

deregulating, loosening and opening up the economy to both the

discipline and opportunity of greater trade and two-way

investment. That has not only made it possible for Australia  and its neighbours to do more business with each otheij; it has  been an important component in rearranging the! mental

furniture of Australians in general, and Australian business

in particular, forcing both to become much more outward

looking.

Thirdly, since the mid-1980s we have also been fundamentally

reshaping our defence posture: while still wholly Committed  to the Western alliance, we no longer begin and end our

planning - as generations of previous Australian governments

have - on the assumption of reflex support from g^eat and

powerful friends. By contrast, we have now built our defence

philosophy and force structure around the concept of defence

self-reliance - developing the capability to handle all but

the most extreme contingencies with our own resources.

Finally, throughout the 1980s, but most visibly in the last  few years, we have been conducting an energetic, independent

foreign policy in the region - built around, but not confined

to, some high profile initiatives like Asia Pacific Economic

Cooperation, the Cambodian UN Peace Plan, and the formation of

the Cairns group of fair agricultural traders. We have also  been active on peace and disarmament issues like the

establishment of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone and the

mobilisation of support for a Comprehensive Chemical Weapons

Convention; in encouraging a new approach to dialogue on

security matters generally in the region; in tackling the

problem of Indo-Chinese refugee outflows; and in developing  new layers of depth in our various bilateral relationships,

for example with the path-breaking Timor Gap Treaty with

Indonesia.

s

our whole approach to the conduct of our foreign policy in

recent times has been to play the role not of an outsider

looking into the region, but of an active participant in the

region's affairs, a cooperative partner in the resolution of

regional problems.

In the limited time available, let me focus by way of

illustration on just one of the foreign policy initiatives I  have mentioned - the launching of APBC. I do so not least

because of Hong Kong's immediate interest in becoming part of

that grouping - and before I conclude I would like to say a

little more about Australia's policy toward Hong KOng, not

only in relation to APEC, but more generally.

ftRla Pacific Economic Cooperation

The idea of a forum for the major trading nations in the Asia

Pacific region to cooperate in the development of mutually

beneficial economic strategies has been around for two and a

half decades, but it only became reality after Australian  Prime Minister Bob Hawke relaunched the idea in a Speech in

Seoul in January 1988. Following this, some sustained and  energetic diplomacy resulted in the inaugural meeting,

attended by twenty-six Ministers from twelve countries, in

Canberra in November 1989.

A follow-up ministerial-level meeting was held in Singapore  last year, and a third is scheduled for Seoul in November this  year. At the Seoul Meeting, we will be discussing, among  other things, the question of future participation in APBC by

the three Chinese economies of PRC, Taiwan and Hong Kong and

progress reports from ten working groups - established to look

at data collection and Â«(change, trade and investment

promotlua, and various kinds Qf sectoral cooperation  strategies.

Contrary to tears expressed in a number of quarters at the

time and subsequently, APEC was not established as a trade

bloc, with an express or implied objective to build

protective walls around itself and the wage aggressive  economic war against everybody else. It was designed to give

strong regional support to international trade liberalisation,

but not to be a regional competitor to an American bloc and a

European bloc. As various commentators have been quick to

point out, while regional arrangements of one kind or another

can be GATT consistent, trade creating rather than trade  diverting, and while the EC and North American Free Trade  arrangement may fall into this categoryf any tripolar d^Yisign  or tne global economy - around yen, dollar and DM blocs - does

have the potential to lead to new restrictions on trade to the

great disadvantage of everyone.

The deliberate effort made in the inauguration of APEC to  straddle the Pacific and engage the United States and Canada  in the process is ample proof of the desire to avoid just that  outcome. And that spirit continues to be evident in the very

great caution with which the Malaysian concept of an Bast Asia

Economic Grouping has been greeted - at least in the original

form of that proposal, which was something very closely

resembling an Asian regional bloc designed to do battle with

the giants of Europe and the united States.

All twelve economies presently in APEC remain extremely

committed to the principle - echoed in every statement made

since the process began - that the future of all of us is

served by the continued opening-up of the international

trading economy, not by retreats to bilateralism and the lures

and temptations of so-called 'managed* trade.

This is not to say that APEC's only role in trade matters is

as a cheer squad for the Uruguay Round - although the group

has played that role, and with it languishing as it is the

Round needs all the political support it can get. Australia

has been particularly keen to press the notion that there are

5

many ways in which the Asia Pacific region can lead by example

in trade policy, and that there is scope for developing a

strategy of non-discriminatory regional trade liberalisation

which will do just that.

This is something which has just started to be seriously

discussed, and it is too early yet to sketch out what form

this strategy might eventually take. One starting point might  be to identify one or more sectors where a high proportion of  the region's trade is sourced from the region itself, and  where gains for regional economies could accordingly be quite

significant. A crucial element of any such region-based move

would of course be that it be non-discriminatory as against

the rest of the world, creating the potential to benefit

countries outside the region as well.

Leading by example has its risks as well as its rewards, and

no doubt a central element in any such strategy would be to

develop means of negotiating reciprocal concessions from

others in return for the marketing opening involved in non-

discriminatory liberalisation within our own region. I

certainly do not underestimate the difficulty and complexity  of the issues involved in translating these broadly stated  aspirations into workable policies. But the important thing

is that these issues are now being addressed, and that APEC is

the process through which this is happening.

No exercise in Asia Pacific Regional Economic Co-operation can

even begin to be complete without drawing in the economies of

China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. At their last meeting in

Singapore, ministers acknowledged the significance of these  three economies for the region, both in terms of present

economic activity and its future prosperity. As just one

example of their importance, their trade with existing a p e c

economies in fact exceeds that of ASEAN itself.

6

Consultations with the three Chinese economies ere now

proceeding, with the ROK, the current chair of APEC, taking

the co-ordinating role. There have been some encouraging signs

of flexibility. But at the same time all of us acknowledge

that there are significant sensitivities and difficulties. We  hope that there is the political will and imagination, by the  authorities in Beijing and Taipei in particular, to address

these sensitivities constructively and flexibly. That they

should do so in all of our interests, and that is one of the

messages I intend to convey to Beijing later this week,

Hong Kona

It is probably fair to say that Australia’s relations with  Hong Kong have in the past been conducted on a reactive and  ad hoc basis. With Hong Kong being such a leading exponent of

free trade, there have been few significant bilateral trade

issues arising between us. Politically we have confined

ourselves to expressing support for the smooth and peaceful

working out of transition arrangements negotiated between Hong

Kong and China. ,

But given the tensions that have developed since 1989, it may

be time to spell out just how much we in Australia value our

relationship with Hong Kong, how importantly we regard the

question of smooth transition, and how much we would be

concerned at any developments - economic or political - which  would undermine either international confidence in the future  of Hong Kong, or the confidence of the people of Hbng Kong

themselves.

Australia has major economic, cultural and political interests

in Hong Kong. Two way trade amounted to just over $2 billion

in 1990, with Hong Kong being Australia's ninth-most important  export market. Hong Kong is the fifth most important

destination for Australian investment abroad ($2.5 billion)  and by mid-1989 Hong Kong had invested some $6.8 billion in

7

Australia. Hong Kong is Australia's third largest source of

migrants and largest source of business migrants, over 14,000  people migrated from Hong Kong to Australia in 1989-90, and  the figure could reach 17,000 this year, which would represent

13 per cent of our total intake. Hong Kong is an important

and growing source of tourists (47,500 in 1989-90) and fee

paying students (5,120 in 1989-90). Over 12,500 Australians

live in Hong Kong, and some 250 Australian companies operate

on Hong Kong soil.

Australia has taken positive steps to promote Hong Kong's  international economic autonomy, as provided for in the 1989

sino-British Joint Declaration. Among other things, Australia  has taken the lead in supporting Hong Kong's succession to the

GATT in 1985 as a separate Contracting Party; Hong Kong's

application (accepted in September 1990) to join the Pacific

Economic Co-operation Committee (PBCC); and Hong Kong's  efforts to participate in the APEC process.

Australia has also assisted Hong Kong by taking a robust view

about the appropriate definition of refugee status to be

applied to the Indo-Chinese boat people, and by accepting an

appropriate of Vietnamese boat people screened in as genuine

refugees. We also agreed to resettle 11,000 of the boat

people who arrived in Hong Kong before the cut-off date of 16

June 1988 - 8,500 of these had been accepted by the middle of

last year.

Australia continues to support the transition arrangements

agreed to in the 1984 Joint Declaration. In accordance with

these principles we will seek to maintain a constructive

dialogue about Hong Kong affaire with both China and Britain;

continue to encourage separate Hong Kong participation in

relevant international forums, especially APEC; seek to

conclude relevant separate bilateral treaties and agreements

with Hong Kong; continue to encourage actively bilateral trade

and investment links; and develop further Hong Kong's

8

potential as a source of fee paying students, which will  assist Hong Kong to overcome its skilled labour shortage and

promote Australian educational exports.

On the subject of immigration, we are conscious of the need,

for a variety of reasons, to have in place an irftigration

scheme which, without departing from its global non-

discriminatory character, is able to be sensitive to the  situation of Hong Kong residents. We will not introduce a  right of abode scheme for Hong Kong residents along the lines

of the British nationality package, because that would

compromise our universal non-discriminatory policy; we have

spent almost 20 years trying to erase the slur of previously

discriminatory policies and we are not about to tar ourselves

with that brush again.

But as part of our global immigration policy, we do already  offer flexible immigration arrangements which in some respects

compares favourably, in their practical impact, to those

offered by other countries. There are a number of flexible

elements in our present standard immigration rules and

practices which are of universal application but are likely to

be of particular interest and significance for Hong Kong  residents in present circumstances.

First, all migrants - those who obtain the right of permanent

residence in Australia - automatically receive a three year

multiple re-entry facility as part of their migrant visa:

there is thus considerable flexibility to travel oversees in  the first years of settlement.

Secondly, under one aspect of our resident return policy,

employees of Australian firms who qualify under standard

criteria for migration to Australia, and their families, are

permitted to continue to reside in their country of origin -

for up to five years at a time - after they ha fe obtained

permanent residence in Australia. Employees of Australian

9

firms, so long as they remain so employed, need under present

rules to spend only one day in Australia during the first

three years, and thereafter only one day every five years, to

retain their right to take up permanent residence in

Australia.

Thirdly, under another aspect of our resident return policy,  people who are not employees of Australian firms but who  qualify under the business migration program, and whose

business requires them to pursue business activities outside

Australia, are able to benefit from exactly the same flexible

visa arrangements as apply to such migrant employees.

Fourthly, there are also some flexible rules under the  resident return policy applicable to migrants who are not

employees of Australian firms or business migrants but who are

family members of Australian citizens. These rules can

operate in practice to enable the deferring of take-up of

Australian residence even when no member of the migrant family

is an Australian citizen to begin with. If during the first

three years after a migrant enters Australia, his or her

spouse gains Australian citizenship (which requires only two  years actual physical residence) that migrant is in practice  in the same position as migrant employees of Australian firms

- in this case*— if_.the. AmtikmliiiiL-citizen— i!L-queetion..chooses

to reside overseas (in this case Hong Kong) be or she can be  accompanied by immediate family members while doing so, and

those other family members themselves only need, in order to  retain their own right to permanently reside in Australia, to

spend one day in Australia during the first three years, and

thereafter one day every five years.

In brief, where migrants need to return overseas (in this case

to Hong Kong) - to work for an Australian company or pursue

relevant buoinooo interests or accompany an Australian citizen  who chooses to reside overseas - then our existing resident

return visa policy can accommodate that.

%

ÃÂ

All the rules to which I have referred are, i repeat,

universally applicable: but they are applicable to Hong

Kong as anywhere else.

We in Australia have no doubt where our future lies, we want

to be good International citizens, and we want to be good

regional neighbours. We want to maximise our economic

interests, and maintain and increase the standard of living of

our own people. We understand the dynamic, explosive growth  until now, and the potential for further explosive growth in

the future, in the Asia Pacific region.

We believe that we have much to contribute to the region as

well as to take from it, and that our record in recent years

demonstrates the nature and extent of that commitment. We

look forward to joining with, and working with, Hong Kong and

everyone else in the region to ensure that together we reap  the rewards - economic, political, strategic and cultural -

that only a genuinely cooperative partnership can bring.
