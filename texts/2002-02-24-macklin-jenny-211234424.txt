REINVIGORATING THE POLITICAL PROCESS

SPEECH BY JENNY MACKLIN MP DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE QUEENSLAND YOUNG LABOR CONFERENCE

BRISBANE

11.30AM, 24TH FEBRUARY 2002

Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. First, let me say, it is no accident that I am giving my first major speech as Deputy Leader of the Federal Labor Party to a Young Labor conference.

You, as the youngest members of the Labor Party, offer new perspectives and new directions. Your focus is squarely on the future.

You are all here today because you are passionate about politics and ideas. One way or another, whatever your passions, you want to participate. You want to make the world a fairer and a better place.

Participation and debate are the very heart and soul of what we believe in as activists. Our policy review has to be about developing the policies that deliver fairness and a better society. But it must also be about participation.

I believe that young people must be given every opportunity and encouragement to sign up for the debate about who we are and where we are going as a nation.

Without debate, society stagnates and turns inward. Mediocrity will flourish. Without debate and dissension, truth is suppressed.

Writer Donald Horne has warned:

“it is not uniformity that produces a harmonious society - neither by physical suppression nor by coercion of opinion. It is by the acceptance of difference, an acquaintance with its perils and virtues…..”

Australia needs this sort of debate…but it’s obvious it only makes John Howard feel very unrelaxed and very uncomfortable.

One of the most dispiriting consequences of six years under the Howard Government has been the diminution of political debate and thought.

Like his counterparts in big business, John Howard is an ardent advocate of downsizing.

He’s downsized our curiosity, our creativity, our national esteem and our compassion. He wants an Australia that is compliant and unquestioning; a place where the established order is nurtured and unchallenged.

2

He’s downsized our expectations of political standards. And this is from the man who preached to us about a “more decent and honest” government, who promised higher standards, more integrity and greater accountability.

But with our expectations so reduced even our outrage is downsized. With deceit and betrayal increasingly the norm, we’re scarcely surprised when the former Defence Minister Peter Reith is caught out not once, not twice, but three times.

Peter Reith, close confidant and supporter of the Prime Minister, was the man who said during the election campaign:

“Well, it did happen. The fact is the children were thrown into the water. “I am just answering the question. And the best way I am answering is by saying here are photos…”

But on the same day that Mr Reith told Melbourne radio ‘it did happen’, his office had been told Defence had doubts.

In fact the photographs prove nothing because they were taken when the boat sank, the day after the children were allegedly thrown overboard.

Reith was caught out again when he told The Australian newspaper that he did not speak to the Prime Minister the night before the Press Club speech about the alleged children overboard incident.  When the Prime Minister stated in Parliament that Mr Reith was the person he checked with, the former Defence Minister was forced to deny the newspaper story to belatedly corroborate the Prime Minister’s claim.

Reith’s third effort with the truth was revealed by Air Marshal Houston who told the Senate Inquiry that three days before the election he informed Minister Reith that children were not thrown overboard.

But only last week Reith said, ‘There is no doubt in my mind that the incident happened. I never had advice otherwise and I acted in good faith.”

According to Air Marshall Houston, Reith’s response was shocked silence. We can only conclude it’s the silence of a guilty man.

But then, Reith says he didn’t do anything about this information because he was at a submarine launching and he didn't have a very good mobile phone line.

In Parliament over the past two weeks, day after day we have seen further damning evidence that this Government will sacrifice all pretence of truth and honesty to achieve its political ends.  The children overboard affair has revealed the magnitude of their deceit.

John Howard wants us to believe that although dozens of public servants knew almost from the start of the election campaign that children were never hurled into the ocean, this information was not passed on to him or his Ministers.

3

It was either: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Monumental incompetence on the part of the public service Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The emergence of a sinister culture that encourages some public servants to be complicit in the deceit, or Ã¢ÂÂ¢ John Howard knew.

What we do know is that: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prime Minister’s Office knew. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet knew. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Defence knew, and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Defence Minister knew

They all knew that the story they concocted to demonise asylum seekers was false.

And if truth has been the first casualty in the children overboard affair, it’s the tellers of the truth who are at greatest risk from John Howard and his political gang.

Take, for example, Air Marshall Houston who, as Acting Chief of the Defence Forces, personally informed Peter Reith that children had not been thrown overboard.

How’s he rewarded for his frank and fearless advice? With a sotto voce threat from Peter Costello:

“We'll get rid of the Air Vice Marshal.”

Whistleblowers who threaten to expose the government, will also start thinking twice before telling the truth now that legislation proposed by the government will result in them facing jail sentences.

Not content with manipulating and politicising the public service, John Howard and his government are intent on shutting down public debate.

From the man who crowed after the 1996 election that “the pall of censorship on certain issues has lifted” we have seen the systematic closing down of debate and the deliberate cultivation and manipulation of people’s inherent fears and insecurities.

So the very Prime Minister who decried the “pall of censorship” is the calculating architect of the new ‘out of bounds’ politics - a political culture that condemns discussion of provocative issues as dangerous, destabilising and unpatriotic.

Speaking at the Young Liberals conference early this year, Employment Relations Minister Tony Abbott made his particular raft of ‘out of bounds’ issues very clear when he took the opportunity to clearly list exactly what ‘decent’ Australians should NOT talk about.

4

The no-go zone is comprehensive. According to Mr Abbott, true-blue Aussies don’t talk about the distribution of wealth, reconciliation, the republic, multiculturalism and immigration.

And again, those who dare raise these issues are dismissed by the Employment Minister as bothersome elites who are not only out of touch with mass opinion but who also demonstrate a contempt for “the culture that shaped them… “

The criterion for this Government is simple - if it’s provocative or disturbing or casts the Government in a poor light - it’s ‘out of bounds.’

So when the independent welfare service, St Vincent de Paul had the temerity to point out that the poor were actually increasing in number, Employment Minister Tony Abbott put them firmly in their place. As one commentator paraphrased Mr Abbott:

“Vinnies should stick to things they understood ..like dispensing alms, and stop talking about things they don’t understand like the relationship between poverty and public policy.”

The clear inference being that public policy should not be a concern to those who actually come into day-to-day contact with the poor!

Silencing the critics by silencing debate is the new modus operandi of the Howard Government. As journalist Geoffrey Barker puts it, the new Howard Government forecloses discussion of anything that suggests that “this might not be the best possible world and that it might not be the best possible government in it.”

Australia is rapidly turning into a society where individuals either sign up to glib slogans or face vilification because they dare to dissent.

John Howard intentionally stirs up our fears of the unfamiliar and unknown so that we retreat and turn inwards.

Having unleashed our prejudices and fears, he coaxes us into a simplistic world where we’re falsely reassured that the most complex problems can be explained away with one-line answers.

So the issue of border protection is confined to emotive arguments about stopping so-called queue jumpers.

And the 700,000 Australians who can’t get a job are explained away as ‘job snobs’ with no mention of the fact that there are 8 job seekers for every job vacancy.

And we’re asked to believe John Howard’s two-word solution to the drug problem -zero tolerance.

The problem in our education system has a simple answer too. The new Education Minister, Brendan Nelson, says young Australians don’t complete high school because:

5

“…not all of us are biologically or emotionally, equipped or want to undertake that level of study”

According to the Minister, Australian kids are dropping out of school not because the education system is failing them or because schools are starved of funds  - but because some students are just not biologically or emotionally up to it.

Those that aren’t up to it, he says, can spend their lives in “a quiet pond”!

No. It’s more complex than that.

It’s about investment in our education system - and addressing disadvantage wherever we find it  - not biology.

Political debate has been poisoned by the politics of prejudice. Australia, a nation that once embraced people in distress, has become a captive of encouraged prejudice.

By falsely demonising asylum seekers as people prepared to throw their children into the sea, John Howard has diminished our national identity and pride.

And in his quest to de-humanise asylum seekers, Immigration Minister, Phillip Ruddock, has become the author of “Ruddockspeak” - a whole new vocabulary designed to quarantine our natural empathy.

Ruddock’s use of language provoked this comment from The Australian newspaper:

“In his Orwellian world, the prospect of death in custody is an ‘unfortunate outcome’ or ‘mishap’, lipsewing and threats of suicide are ‘inappropriate behaviour’ and an asylum seeker who has fled a tyrannical regime is a person making a ‘lifestyle choice.’

When the desperate leap on to razor wire by a detention centre inmate is described as an “operational matter”, when a child is referred to as “it” and when he speaks of “provedoring” the Tampa rather than simply making sure everyone has enough to eat, it seems to me that these people are intentionally being categorised as less than human.

These strategies are the essence of conservatism.  The establishment, the top end of town, those like Tony Abbott, the rolled gold elite, don’t want anyone to rock the boat - after all they’re the ones who might get tipped out.

It is in their interest for people to lose faith in their political institutions and turn away from public debate.  Those who are disillusioned with the political process don’t bother contributing because they don’t believe they can make a difference.

This is the essential difference between the Labor Party and our conservative opponents.

At a time when vigorous political discussion is being stifled by conservative forces, the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party wants everyone to start talking more and more

6

loudly than ever before. We want to hear what’s wrong; how they think we can fix it; and how government can make a difference.

We have embarked on a wide-ranging policy review. Everything bar the further sale of Telstra is up for debate. My job is to coordinate the Review in a way that encourages as much participation and debate as possible.

As part of its policy review, the Labor Party is actively seeking the opinions and views of as many people and organisations as possible.

This review is part of our determination to re-invigorate  and  “upsize” the democratic process and, I can promise you, it will be inclusive, transparent and broad ranging. This is no quick political fix. It’s part of the development of policies that recognise and define the needs of all Australians and then do something about them.

We have deliberately started the process of policy review in the very areas that I know many of you feel most strongly about. For example, we have developed a broad policy framework for discussion about our position on asylum seekers. We do not agree that people should be dehumanised, either in the way we speak or in the policies that impact on their lives.

In John Howard’s terms this probably isn’t smart politics, because it can’t be controlled or managed.

Forums like this conference play an important role in the review process, because they give Party members the chance to propose, discuss and debate innovative and imaginative policies.

They are also important because they are about involvement and inclusion.

There is no one model for conducting this policy review. ALP Branches, unions, community organisations, schools, pensioner groups and workplaces - will want to engage with us in different ways. And we need to think about how we can hear as many voices as possible.

The Australian Labor Party places a lot of importance on participation and belonging. Through Young Labor you can meet people who share your values. More importantly, you confront people who strongly disagree with, and challenge your own views.

Inevitably but encouragingly, there will be gulfs of difference but there will also be much that unites and inspires us.

It is a time to encourage people to raise their voices and be heard.

And this includes Young Labor voices.  When your membership is articulating ideas, alternatives policies and yes … disagreement and dissent, the entire Young Labor movement is strong and effective.

But when the membership is consumed by factional games - building up power bases and settling personal scores, Young Labor is weak.

7

It’s no different at more senior levels of the party.  Nationally, Labor can only succeed when it restores people’s faith in the political process. When it encourages people to once again become enthusiastic about the policy process. When people believe that they can make a difference.

The strength of the Labor Party lies in its advocacy for change and its determination to win government and make it happen.
