PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ORIENTAL HOTEL, BANGKOK  4 FEBRUARY 1989

E & ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: How long do you think it will be before the uncertainty is cleared up, or is there no uncertainty?

PM: Mr DoWding is not claiming victory tonight although he  is optimistic that the Government has been returned. He  thinks it could be a day or so before all the details are  finalised as to what the order of the outcome would be but  he, as I say, is not claiming victory but thinks the

Government has been returned.

JOURNALIST: What do you draw from a cliff-hanger?

PM: Satisfaction, if that is the outcome, because you have a  situation where you've had such a tremendous concentrated  bitter campaign against the Labor Party in Western Australia.  It was said that WA Inc was going to wipe them out, there was

all the story about interest rates and mortgages, home costs.  I think you have a situation where, as I said when I was in  the campaign over there, that I believe that in the end  politicians and commentators tend to underestimate the

intelligence of the electorate. In the end the majority of  Australians are concerned, as between two parties, on the  record, which one is most likely to address the issues which  in a day to day sense affect their well-being. That seems to  be the outcome in West Australia. I might say too that from  what I'm told at least one seat, perhaps more, has been lost

to Labor because of the change in the voting system. They  brought in the method whereby for the Upper House a tick  against the Labor Party box would ensure that your vote was

valid, and apparently thousands have thought that you could  do the same thing for the Lower House. So it looks as though  Barry Hodge for instance in Melville lost his seat there  by it's thought perhaps 11 votes or something like that. A  couple of thousand votes have been clearly indicated as being

intended for him. So when you take that into account too it  seems to me to be a pretty good outcome. Let me say this, I’m glad to have been there in the campaign associated with  Labor. We were wanted as distinct from the ban that was put

upon my federal colleagues.

JOURNALIST: There’ve been big swings against Labor in the mortgage belt areas, there've been two seats lost. Are you  concerned about that and do you think that there could be a  need to reconsider the economic settings?

PM: No, we're not going to change economic settings because we look as though we’ve won an election in Western Australia  - it wouldn’t be very good economic management.  No, we’ll go  about the process of controlling the economy as we think it’s-  necessary. Yes,  it looks as though there’s been some loss of

support in some of those mortgage belt areas but it's not  entirely surprising.

JOURNALIST: What do you believe are the federal implications?

PM: I think for Labor we're entitled to be satisfied but not complacent. I'm certainly never complacent in politics. But  I think a lot of people were expecting that this was going to  be the one where another Labor government fell. Certainly ray  opponent Mr Howard was saying without any doubt that’s what  was going to happen,  although they certainly didn't want him  over there as being any part of the process. But he was

trumpeting another victory for the anti-Labor forces - well,  he’s wrong again.  What his own people think about that in  the federal sphere is a matter of interest I guess.

JOURNALIST:  How important is this outcome in terms of Labor  Party morale generally?

PM: It always is better to have a win than a loss.  As I ’ve said before,  winning beats the hell out of losing.  We've got  a situation now where quite clearly, if you go round  Australia,  just quickly, let me give you a run down.

Queensland - Labor looking better than it ever has.  NSW -  the government of Greiner already in decay and Labor’s morale  up a great deal. We’ve won in Victoria, Bannon will win in  South Australia, an election coming up in Tasmania - we have  a great deal of confidence there - we’ve now won in West  Australia. So, as I say, it would be silly to be complacent  but given all the gloom and doom that was around last year, I

think we’re in good shape.

JOURNALIST: You do sound like you're claiming victory for  the Labor Party.

PM: I’m doing no more than what Mr Dowding has done.  I ’m repeating him, I ’m not claiming victory, but he is saying he  has optimism, on what’s in now, that the Government has been  returned. My comments therefore are based upon that premise

of Mr Dowding.

JOURNALIST:  Given those swings in the mortgage belt areas, are you concerned about implications of that for Labor's  federal seats?

PM: If you were going to an election now there's no doubt  that the tight monetary policy which produced these sorts of  results would be uncomfortable electorally.  But we're not  going to an election now, we are conducting economic policy

in a way that's necessary in the light of the present  circumstances.  The simple fact of life, which again I think  the electors of Western Australia seem to have understood,, is*  that the level of economic activity has been somewhat too  high.  We’ve got to not sit back a little bit because we  can't sustain this level of imports associated with that high

level of activity. We believe that the policy that we've got  in place will start to have the sort of outcome that we want  and by the time that we go to the next election I don't think  we'll have exactly the same circumstances that we've got now.

JOURNALIST: When will that be, in the light of this result?

PM: This result doesn't change the window that I've talked  about.  It's the latter part of this year to May of next  year.  I've been consistent about that - no change.

JOURNALIST: We've seen two very tight elections in the last six months,  Victoria and Western Australia.  Do you think  that's the way it's going to be up to and including the next  federal election?

PM: I think Labor will continue to win.  We'll win the next federal election. I hope to retain the sort of majority  we’ve got now, perhaps increase it.

JOURNALIST:  What part did leadership play, do you think, in  the WA poll?

PM: A great deal.  Peter Dowding was clearly intrinsically a better leader and was perceived to be a better leader.  I'm  not here to knock Mr McKinnon, the Liberals will do that  themselves, but he was clearly a much better leader and much

more acceptable.  So leadership was pretty important.

JOURNALIST:  WA Inc clearly played a role in the election.  Do  you think it's an issue which was confined to WA or are you  concerned that it could spill over into the federal arena?

PM: If it spills over to the federal arena I tell you who’ll  be worried, and it won’t be us.  If you want to look at where  there is corruption between parties and business, it’s not  with Labor. You look at Queensland and NSW, it’s the

conservative forces that need to be worried about that issue, -   not us.
