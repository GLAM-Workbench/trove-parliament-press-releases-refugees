Interview with Tanya Plibersek

Australian Agenda program, 18 August 2013



Peter Van Onselen:

Paul, I'll go through each of the campaigns, the Rudd campaign, how do you think it's

going?



Paul Kelly:

Well, I think the Labor campaign has been undermined by these public opinion polls we

have seen over the last several days published in both 'The Australian' and in the two

main Fairfax papers.  These polls show Labor losing seats and losing support in a range

of critical areas, the New South Wales Central Coast, part of Western Sydney, Victoria

and Queensland.



Some of the results are quite extraordinary.  In particular the massive swing shown

against Peter Beattie, the former Queensland Premier and Labor candidate for the seat

of Forde.  The point to make, however, is that it's not completely bad news for Labor.

And what we are seeing is a lot of significant variations seat by seat.



Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

However, I think that the bad news in the polls for Labor is reinforced by doubts about

Kevin Rudd's own performance this week.  I think Rudd has had difficulty articulating

the central message of the election campaign for the Labor Party.  I think that he's

chopped and changed his message day by day far too often. His policy announcement

on Northern Australia was ill-considered, ill-prepared and that showed.



What we have seen over the course of this weekend is Kevin Rudd focusing on the car

industry making a very significant announcement about extra support for the car

industry.  While that will help Labor in a couple of key seats I don't think for one

moment that extra subsidies for the car industry will turn around this election for the

Labor Party.  Kevin Rudd has still got three weeks left.  That's enough time for him to

reverse the trend, but he'll have to sort out a new approach for the Labor campaign

and that won't be easy.



Peter Van Onselen:

As you say, just under three weeks to ago.  How's the Abbott campaign looking?



Paul Kelly:

I think the Abbott campaign is much better prepared and far better organised than

Labor and the feature of Tony Abbott is he stays on message more than Kevin Rudd.

He wants to sharpen the choices at this election.  Witness his announcement that the

Liberal Party will preference the Greens last everywhere.



Abbott has made a number of mistakes over the course of the last week.  Witness his

comment about sex appeal, but I think it is true to say that Labor has had difficulty

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

getting the anti-Abbott negative campaign off the ground and functioning effectively,

and some of the polls show that Abbott's personal standing is actually increasing.



When it comes to announcements more of the Liberal announcements tend to be

around their central policy messages, whether it's paid parental leave or asylum seeker

boat arrivals.  Having said that, the main defect in the Abbott campaign is quite

obvious, it relates to costings.  There remains a very significant gap between Liberal

spending commitments on one hand and Liberal funding commitments on the other.



I think in this sense the Labor campaign on this front is completely justified, raising the

doubt about what Tony Abbott's got to hide.  It now seems fairly clear that we won't

see the full Liberal costings until the last couple of days of the election.  While that is an

understandable tactic, I think that it's also risky.



Peter Van Onselen:

Paul Kelly, thanks very much for that analysis.  As we mentioned off the top, we're

joined now in the studio by the Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek. Welcome to the

program.



Tanya Plibersek:

Good morning.



Peter Van Onselen:

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

Could I ask you about the costings that I mentioned in the opening and Paul just

mentioned then by way of starting, it's something we are critical of Tony Abbott about,

but it is something that both sides from opposition do.  Labor did it in 2007, now Tony

Abbott's doing it again in the 2013 election. What can be done to stop Oppositions

doing them?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, we agreed to the Charter of Budget Honesty, before we knew who was going to

win those elections, and that would suggest they should submit their costings now.

We've got the pre-election fiscal outlook ready.  They know what the numbers are.

What they did before the last election in 2010, was hand out costings minutes before

the election.  And we found after the election an $11 billion black hole in those costings.



I think it's not credible to keep announcing policies and saying we'll tell you not just

what they'll cost afterwards but how will we pay for them.  What will we cut to be able

to afford to make these new commitments.



The issue is not just the cost of the policies, but you've got to be able to cut other areas

of expenditure to afford them, or you go further into deficit.  I think what will be cut

part of the equation is very important.  When you look at what has happened in

Queensland, they took a very similar approach.  Campbell Newman before the election

was not keen to talk about their plans for Queensland.  They announced this

Commission of Audit.  After the Commission of Audit have made massive cuts to health,

to education, to other areas of public spending that people feel very strongly about.



Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

The health cuts alone, $3 billion cut from health in their first budget and more than

4000 health workers sacked.  To say to the Australians now, well, just trust us at a

federal level and we'll do the same sort of thing.  We will get into government and then

we'll tell you what we're going to cut, it's not fair.



Peter Van Onselen:

I want to get into health issues for the bulk of the interview.  Before doing that, how do

you think the Labor campaign is going?  Kevin Rudd was up in the Northern Territory

with the announcement about his plans for the north.  It was a two-page press release

with no details, with no real commitments other than the aspirational goal of a 20%

company tax at some stage down the track.  It seems like there is a disconnect

between head office potentially and the Rudd campaign as it moves around making up

policy as it goes.



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, that's certainly not the case.  I mean, it's a very high energy campaign.  You're

right in saying that the Prime Minister is in different places every day, talking about

things that matter to Australians, but that's great.  I mean how disappointing if we had

a leader who was like Tony Abbott sticking to one or two policy areas and every time he

opens his mouth just putting his foot in it.



Paul Kelly:

These polls look very bad for the Government, the published polls.



Tanya Plibersek:

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

Well, I think "very bad" is a bit of a catastrophising.  We're slightly behind now and

we've got three weeks to go.



Paul Kelly:

To what extent is there real concern in the Government about the direction and the

performance of the campaign?



Tanya Plibersek:

There's no concern.  We are a united team who are behind a Prime Minister who is

working as hard as a human being can possibly work to win this campaign for the Labor

Party.  We have got a week of terrific health policies this week that we'll be rolling out

during the week, including today and we'll talk about that a little bit later, I know.  But

we are very proud of what Kevin is doing to lead us in the leadup to the election.  It's

very high energy, that's true, but that is something we love about him.



Paul Kelly:

Well, would you accept that Labor, in fact, is behind at this stage of the campaign?



Tanya Plibersek:

On a two-party preferred basis, based on the published polls, sure.



Paul Kelly:

How does Labor bridge the gap?

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek



Tanya Plibersek:

We work hard and we tell people- - -



Paul Kelly:

No, work hard's good enough, I mean how does Labor bridge the gap?



Tanya Plibersek:

We tell people what we've achieved and what our plan is for the future.  By 2007 the

economy has grown by 14%.  We've created almost a million jobs.  At the same time as

having a strong economy, one of only eight countries in the world to have three AAA

credit ratings.  We have managed to roll out a social agenda with DisabilityCare and

investment in education that will change the face of Australia.



We need to remind people of that record again and again and the difference between

Tony Abbott and Kevin Rudd is that Kevin Rudd has a plan for jobs of the future,

education of the future, how Australia remains competitive in a changing world.  What

are Tony Abbott's plans?  Do you know them?  Do you know them?



Peter Van Onselen:

There's less than three weeks to go before the election.  It looks like now you'll have a

week at least talking about health.  And we'll get into some of the details that are

already out there today.  But is that is too long?  I mean, waiting this long before

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

getting on to what is always regarded as a Labor strong suit according to polls about

issues for the electorate.  Why wait this long?



Tanya Plibersek:

Look, I think it's a funny question in a way.  Peter Dutton's been Shadow Health

Minister for three years and not asked Nicola Roxon a question when she was my

predecessor and not asked me a question.  The only health policy they've got so far is

to close down Medicare Locals.  $1.8 billion taken out of front line health services in

local communities.  There is not an identifiable health policy from the Opposition. In

contrast, we have- - -



Peter Van Onselen:

Doesn't that go to my point, you Should be starting the campaign on health, not getting

to it this week.



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, I've been talking about health the whole campaign.  We, for example on the first

or second day of the campaign, we announced an extra $19.5 million for the Life House

Cancer Centre at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  Last week we were down in Victoria for

a $100 million dollar redevelopment of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.  It's

not like this has been a silent area from the Labor Party.  There has not been a single

commitment, announcement, question, event from the Liberals



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

But if we focus again on the Labor campaign.  Has something been lost here in the

transition from Gillard to Rudd?  Why hasn't there been a greater emphasis on, say,

DisabilityCare, on the Gonski school agenda?  I mean doesn't that surprise you?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, I think there has been a great emphasis- - -



Paul Kelly:

No, there hasn't, no, there hasn't. There hasn't, Minister.  I mean Kevin Rudd hasn't put

these things up there in lights.  I can assure you of that



Tanya Plibersek:

We've DisabilityCare events all around Australia.  I gave in my own electorate.



Paul Kelly:

Sure.



Tanya Plibersek:

It's in all in our campaign material.  Education, I think you'll see that the Prime Minister

has been visiting school after school talking about the difference between Labor's

education policies and the lack of investment that would come under Tony Abbott,

who's only guaranteed $2.8 billion of the $10 billion that the Federal Government, that

our government, has committed to the Gonski education reforms.

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek



I think just about every day you can find a picture of the Prime Minister in a different

school in a different part of Australia.



Paul Kelly:

Okay, now, let's just go to the Liberal's campaign.  We have Tony Abbott's

announcement of his paid parental leave scheme, which, as we know, an incredibly

generous scheme based on full wage levels up to $150,000 a year.  What is your main

objection to this scheme?



Tanya Plibersek:

It's incredible unfair.  We don't pay benefits to people in Australia - we don't give more

to the people who already have more.  We give more help to the people who need

more help.  This is a scheme that pays you, if you're on 150,000 a year or 200 or

$300,000 a year you get $75,000 to have a baby.  If you're on $30,000 a year you get

$15,000 to have a baby.  If you're on 20 or 15, you get half of that.



And today Tony Abbott has announced that people who work at any level of

government will be excluded, so if you're a council childcare worker, if you're a cleaner

in a hospital, you'll miss out on paid parental leave, but if you're a lawyer in a big city

firm you'll get $75,000 a year.  How is that fair?



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

But isn't the problem - sure, I understand the argument that you're making. But isn't

the problem that because Tony Abbott is offering more, more women are likely to be

attracted to his scheme?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, there will be more women on $150,000 a year or $200,000 a year who might

think I'll get more out of his scheme.  At lot of those women would think it's a little

unfair that I get $75,000 a year and my cleaner gets $15,000 a year.  I think there will

be a million women who miss out because they work for Local Government, State

Government or Federal Government who will also say, "Why do I not deserve paid

parental leave?  If he's throwing money around in this way, why do I miss out?"



I think it's interesting also that they've had to delay the implementation of this to 2015

because they just can't afford it.  The Nationals don't like it.  The Nationals will say

we're not going to vote for one baby being worth more than another baby.  And they

are quite right to raise that objection.



Peter Van Onselen:

It's not about one baby being worth more than another, is it?  It's about turning in into

a workplace entitlement, so that what a woman receives when she goes on maternity

leave equates to what she earns.



Tanya Plibersek:

Workplace entitlements are paid by employers.  When the taxpayer pays for something

then we should give the greatest amount of help to the people who need it most.

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek



Peter Van Onselen:

But the Liberal Party would say that it's not the taxpayer per se, it's a targeted levy on

big business.



Tanya Plibersek:

It's a tax that all of us pay.  If Coles is paying the tax you'll pay for it at the cash

register.  If Woolworths is paying the tax you'll pay for it through the cash register.  I

mean these businesses will pass on the costs so that all of us will pay.  And the general

principle is that if your employer wants to top up your paid parental leave, if you're on

the Government scheme which has already benefited more than 300,000 families, and

your employer says, "Well, we want to pay you more than the minimum wage.", they

can double it and triple it if they wish to, good luck to them, I would support employers

doing that.  The principle is if taxpayers are paying for it you shouldn't have the largest

amount of money going to the wealthiest people.



Peter Van Onselen:

Stay with us, we're talking to the Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, when we come back

we will focus on announcements in the papers today but plan for the week ahead by

the Government.  See you in a moment.



Peter Van Onselen:

Welcome back, you're watching Australian Agenda where Paul Kelly and I are talking to

the Health Minister Tanya Plibersek.  Miss Plibersek, can I ask you about the

immunisation announcement that's in the papers today.  The Government is going to

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

compel people to have their child immunised if they are to receive Family Tax Benefit A.

That is effectively already the case, isn't it?  All you're doing is removing the

conscientious objection option?



Tanya Plibersek:

Yeah, well, we actually changed it in 2012, so that if you wanted to get Family Tax

Benefit you had to show that your child had been immunised at three checkpoints.  But

there was an out for conscientious objectors.  We're a little bit worried that people are

making that decision a bit too easily.  It is still quite a small number of people.  We're

talking about 1.5% of children that are registered by their parents as conscientious

objectors.  But we do want to push that group a little bit more.



We have very high rates of immunisation by international standards, and we've seen

that improve since we came to government. Rates for five year-olds, for example have

gone from 83% to 90%, that's a good achievement.  But it is one of the single-most

effective and cheapest ways of keeping our community healthy.  We think about 3

million lives are saved every year around the world by immunisation.



We are very lucky in Australia, because so many of these diseases have almost

disappeared that sometimes people become a bit complacent.  They  think- - -



Peter Van Onselen:

Can I ask you, though, on this, what's wrong with the conscientious objector element to

it if some parents have genuine concerns about immunising their child?  If it's such a

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

small percentage, isn't that a good thing for a democracy to give people that that out

but still give them access to the assistance?



Tanya Plibersek:

No-one is going to hold their child down and inject a vaccine into them.  We're just

saying that this benefit, this financial benefit which adds up to about $2,100 over the

five years is payable because we support immunisation.  And this is a way of firming

that support.



We've done a lot of education with parents.  We have updated and released the myths

and facts books about immunisation.  Our Medicare Locals in fact have been terrifically

successful at increasing immunisation rates.  The Southern Adelaide one, for example

went from the low 80's to over 90% immunisation rates.



Again Tony Abbott is going to get rid of Medicare Locals, so I don't know who he thinks

is going to push this immunisation rollout.  It is an important public health benefit with

a great deal of established science to back it.



Paul Kelly:

How important will hospitals policy be in this election campaign, and what sort of

announcements are you planning on hospitals over the course of the coming week?



Tanya Plibersek:

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

Well, health and hospitals always show up as a very important election issue.  I think

it's one of our great areas of success as a Labor Government.  Since 2007 we've

transformed the way that the health system works in Australia.  We've made hospital

funding more transparent, we've made hospital success at elective surgery and

emergency waiting times, even things like hand hygiene transparent and available to

the public.  By the end of the decade we will put an extra $20 billion into the public

hospitals.



We have rolled out better primary health care through our Medicare Locals and building

GP super clinics and so on.  I think it is and should be a critical issue for the rest of the

campaign.  I must say it is very difficult to engage the Liberals on this.  As you know,

I've never had a question from Peter Dutton, the Shadow Health Minister.  There is no

policy announced by the Liberals yet except to kill off Medicare Locals, $1.8 billion taken

out of primary health care services.



I would like it to be an issue for the election.  I can't even get a firm debate date with

Peter Dutton for the Press Club.



Paul Kelly:

Well, what about particular hospitals that you're putting extra funding into?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, today we're announcing, for example, about $357 million extra in health

infrastructure and extra services around the country.  That money has come in part

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

from the excise increase on tobacco that we announced in the economic statement

some time ago.



Peter Van Onselen:

So it is funded under the existing funding envelope?



Tanya Plibersek:

We provisioned for it at the time that we announced the excise increase.   In New

South Wales, for example, it's $160 million extra.  Westmead, there will be a $100

million upgrade to Westmead that we hope the New South Wales Government will

match.  An extra $10 million through the Children's Medical Research Institute at

Westmead as well and an extra 12 million for the Millennium Research Institute in

Westmead.  Similar sorts of programs right around the country.



We announced during the week a $100 million upgrade to the Victorian Eye and Ear

Hospital.  We have got extra funding for Flinders Medical to upgrade their paediatric

area there, and similarly in all of the states and territories.



Paul Kelly:

Aren't we going to see Kevin Rudd running on hospitals?



Tanya Plibersek:

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

Well, I mean, the first event we did was at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at the

beginning of the campaign investing in the fantastic Life House Cancer  Centre that is

being built at RPA.  It would never have been build but for Kevin Rudd when he was

Prime Minister taking an interest in the work of Chris O'Brien, who sadly we've lost since

then.



We've invested more than $4 billion extra in upgrading cancer facilities and listing new

medicines and so on.  It has been a very strong area of investment for the Labor

Government.



Peter Van Onselen:

Are you happy with the overall direction of health reform by the Government, because

it is quite different in design, admittedly not because of a lack of want by the Federal

Labor Government over the last six years but the lack of an ability to get agreement by

the states from what was originally being discussed in the years of Opposition ahead of

the 07 election as well as in the first couple of years in Government when Nicola Roxon

was still the Health Minister.  Are you satisfied with what you've ended up with, or in

another three years if Labor is successful in this election would you be looking for large

scale health reform to try to get to what you originally hoped for?



Tanya Plibersek:

Look, I think that Australians are rightly proud of Medicare and our health system.  If

you look around the world I don't think you could point to another health system you'd

prefer to have.  But it doesn't mean that we can just rest on our laurels.  We need to

continue to improve it.  I think the design principles that we landed on are absolutely

right.  So more transparency in hospitals activity-based funding, so if hospitals look

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

after more people they get more funding and reward for effort, so if they treat people

more quickly they get a reward for that.



I think some of the difficulties have been in the continued reticence of some states to

fully participate in handing over their data.  Simple things like that. It's very difficult to

have the sort of cooperative health system that we want to have when you've got

Liberal state governments making big cuts to their health budgets.



Peter Van Onselen:

The question you get from the Liberals there's a duplication here that is going on

between the Commonwealth and the states in terms of administration of health?



Tanya Plibersek:

No, actually the reverse is true.  There is an article coming out shortly in the medical

journal that will go through some of the successes of the health reforms, but in fact

we've now got one national funding pool and one administrator, so that everyone can

see transparently what does the Commonwealth Government put into hospital funding.

What do the states put into hospital funding.  We have got one national benchmark for

the efficient price of a hospital service.  So, if it's a hip replacement obviously it's a

higher price, if it's a simple thing like a cataract it's a lower price.  But we know that if

this hospital does so many cataract operations that's the sort of funding they should get

to acknowledge that.



Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

I think it's - it's a large and complex system.  Next year we will spend almost $80 billion

at a Commonwealth level on our health system.  It's large and complex.  But it's today

more transparent and more accountable than it has ever been.



Paul Kelly:

Well, just on that point, minister, do you think that Tony Abbott Liberals are running

dead on health and hospitals and how do you elevate this and make this an election

issue?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, you're asking me to talk political strategy.  I don't want to talk political strategy, I

want to talk health policy.  I think- - -



Peter Van Onselen:

You won't get to if you don't have the strategy to make it front and centre.



Tanya Plibersek:

I think it is incredible that someone should seek to become Prime Minister who has

been Health Minister and not want to talk about health.  It's one of the things that most

Australians are most interested in knowing what are the Government plans for our

health system.  Tony Abbott when he was health minister cut a billion dollars of funding

from the health system.  I can't remember a single major reform that Tony Abbott

made as Health Minister.  I remember many of the problems that he created at the

Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

time, and then you've got Peter Dutton now who seeks to be Health Minister who has

no policies out there.



Paul Kelly:

On the first leaders' debate there was very little discussion about health and hospitals

policy.  Would you like to see more discussion about that in this coming week when we

see the leaders debating again?



Tanya Plibersek:

I would like to see a debate at the National Press Club between Peter Dutton and me

I'm not sure I will get that.  I would like to see the leaders talk about this.  Kevin

Rudd's record is a substantial reform to the health system that has delivered this

transparency and accountability.  Tony Abbott's record as Health Minister is cuts, a

billion dollars worth of cuts to the hospital system.



Paul Kelly:

Now, just going back to the Abbott campaign this week, we saw Tony Abbott's

comment about sex appeal.  Do you think Tony Abbott is a sexist?



Tanya Plibersek:

Oh, well, I really think people have made their own minds up about that.  I don't think

an ongoing commentary from me- - -



Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

Paul Kelly:

And what do you think they've decided?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, I can tell you there are a few groans around the TV when I saw it.  I must say I

feel really sorry for his daughter standing behind him,  I think, with her head down

shaking her head.  Look, I think people have made their own minds up.



Peter Van Onselen:

Do you think Kevin Rudd went too far by weighing into it?  Because I get the

impression that for every person who was offended by what he had to say, there are

people likely, when it is potentially overcooked, to turn around and finding themselves

defending it, even though they don't necessarily like it.  There's that risk, isn't there,

from a political strategy perspective that you can sound shrill in attacking?



Tanya Plibersek:

I think the problem for Tony Abbott if it was a one-off people would, like you say, roll

their eyes, and think, oh, it's a bit stupid, but it's not the worst crime in the world.  The

problem is he keeps saying that sort of stuff, you know.



Paul Kelly:

What's this tell us then?



Australian Agenda 18 August 2013 Tanya Plibersek

Tanya Plibersek:

Well, I think people can make up their own minds up about what it tells them.  I'm not

a psychologist, or - it's for people to make their own minds up.  I would be

embarrassed if my husband or my father says some of the things he says.  But it's up

to people to make their own minds up.



Paul Kelly:

But why is he going so well in the campaign, because some of the polls indicate that his

personal standing is actually improving?



Tanya Plibersek:

Well, that's a mystery.



Peter Van Onselen:

It's a mystery we'll have to leave there.  Tanya Plibersek, we will ask John Hewson and

Jeff Gallop in the next segment whether they can solve it for us, but we appreciate you

joining us on Australian Agenda, thanks for your company.
