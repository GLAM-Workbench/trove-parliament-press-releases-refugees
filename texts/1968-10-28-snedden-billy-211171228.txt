Members of O.V.E. will visit sons, daughters and relatives who have migrated to Australia. They will stay in Australia

for about five months.

legal guardians of Dutch people already settled in Australia,

will pay 50 per cent of the normal tourist return air passage costs.

Other relatives will pay 60 per cent of the normal passage costs.

Average age of the group is 65.

The oldest member is Mr. Onderstal, of Arnhem, who is 72.

He will visit his children in Queensland.

The president of the O.V.E., fir. L. G. Stegeman, said that
