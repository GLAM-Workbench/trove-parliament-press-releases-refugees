CHRIS SMITH:



Good morning and happy New Year to you Minister.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Chris, happy New Year to you too.

CHRIS SMITH:

Good to have you on deck. Now, how are these people exploiting the system? Or is  it the system that's letting us down?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Chris, we've got to bring the system into the 21st century and I think, like all of  us, we've watched over Christmas with some horror. We've entered a new age of  terrorist attacks and people are more brazen in the way in which they plan attacks.  The use of technology and the infiltration of young minds, impressionable young  minds who can quickly turn; that's a real concern for all of us and I think everybody's  viewed that over Christmas.

My Department, for a long period of time, has been working on this issue of how we  can weed out the minority of people that would seek to do us harm - either stop  them from coming here in the first place or deporting them as quickly as possible.

We've done that with a record number of people over the last 12 months. We've  cancelled visas, we've gone back and checked the history of people that have come  claiming protection, we've excluded people on that basis of false claims, etc…

CHRIS SMITH:

…but when you go over the history as I just did, it indicates that either our computer  system or our intelligence technology capabilities were clearly inferior.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Chris you're right, the technology needs to keep up with the threat and we've  introduced the use of biometrics which will stamp out a lot of the fraud that we've  seen over the last 10 or 20 years, for example. So the use of biometrics will stop  some of that fraudulent documentation that experts come up with and we need to be  a step ahead of the bad guys in the use of this technology on an ongoing basis.  We're doing that at airports with the use of the new SmartGates and not just relying  on the human inspection of passport documents.

So there's a lot of work that we've been doing behind the scenes, but we're also  relying, in many cases, on the word of an individual, particularly where a protection  claim has been made. If we reach back into countries where people have come from,  particularly in the Middle East, it's hard to find the specific detail that we require. The  same record systems don't exist as they might in a developed country like ours. So  it's an imperfect system and we need to deal with that threat.

We also need I think to look at the pathway of some people going toward Australian  citizenship. So if people have been involved in serious crime, or gang crime, if  people have been involved in fraud, or if they've been involved in welfare fraud, we  need to question whether or not those people who are on the pathway to Australian  citizenship deserve that outcome.

CHRIS SMITH:

Too right, too right.

PETER DUTTON:

We want people to adopt Australian values in this country. We offer a hand of  friendship to many people who start a new life in our country and the vast majority of  those people do the right thing, settle and become wonderful Australians, but those  who seek to harm us or seek to rip us off or do harm to Australians, we don't tolerate  the presence of those people and that's why I do want to increase the number of  cancellations that we have. We've put $100 million toward some of the systems  developments and there's a lot more in this space to come, but from the Prime  Minister's perspective, from my perspective, it's an absolute priority for 2017.

CHRIS SMITH:

All right. What about the process of citizenship? Have we got that process right?  Because in the past we haven't had the kind of scrutiny on those who want to  become citizens as we probably should. How does the process work now? If I sat  down as an immigration person or as a citizenship official, would I get a chance to

interview someone who wanted to become a citizen and get a chance to see what  was really in their mind and what their likes and dislikes were and where their  sympathies lie?

PETER DUTTON:

That's a good question, Chris. So to a limited extent that can happen. We have  interviews and people need to pass tests.

The question though in the modern age, as I say given the threats that we face from  terrorism, from organised criminal elements, from all of that reality, the question that  we face is whether or not we have the right test, the right questions, whether asking  whether or not people know Don Bradman's batting average is a true test of whether  or not somebody shares an Australian value.

We need to know that, you know, are people allowing their kids to be educated, are  people undertaking English language lessons, are people working if they're able-bodied and of working age, are they working or are they spending all of their time on  welfare or gaming the system? They're the questions I think in the 21st century that  we need to be asking and I think Australians would support that because as I say,  we're a very generous nation, we offer support to many people to start a new life,  and we want people to take advantage, in the right way, of the opportunities a  society like Australia offers.

We want to weed out those people that are doing the wrong or would seek to do the  wrong thing because there are plenty of other people in the queue that would come  here, make a wonderful start like millions of migrants to our country have over many,  many decades and we want to celebrate the good that comes with people migrating  to our country and we want to clamp down very hard on the bad element, even  though it's a minority.

So the answer to your question otherwise is that I think, like we deal with trade and  cargo coming through our ports now, we want to for the people who are doing the  right thing, the traders who are doing the right thing or the people that want to seek  Australian citizenship for the right reasons, we need to fast-track those outcomes,  but we need to slow down and pay greater attention to those smaller numbers who  aren't doing the right thing - people who are claiming welfare when they should be  working, people that aren't allowing their kids to be educated or whatever the test  might be and I think it's a big discussion for us in 2017 - but I think it's one that we  need to have.

CHRIS SMITH:

Sure is. Istanbul; 39 dead, 69 injured, an absolute shocker and a terrible start to  2017.

PETER DUTTON:

It is and it's not an isolated incident. It is a reality for us and I think that frankly  watching the TV with the kids over Christmas, all the drownings of kids in pools and

lakes at home, you look at the terrorist offences, it's been a rough start to 2017 and  as the Prime Minister pointed out in his statement only a couple of days ago; it is a  time for us to I think thank our security forces: the Australian Border Force staff, the  Australian Federal Police, ASIO, all of those people who are doing frontline work, the  ambos, the firies, those people have worked right through Christmas. They have  seen some horrific things and our Government and I think the Australian people want  our Government to provide whatever support we can to those agencies because  these threats won't diminish during the course of 2017. In fact they will increase and  that's why we need to get it right when it comes to migration, when it comes to  cancelling visas of people who are doing the wrong thing.

I've cancelled the visas of 136 or so bikies over the course of the last 12 months  because they're involved in the distribution of ice and drugs and they're a scourge on  our society. So there are different elements that we need to weed out and we  shouldn't apologise for that because we want to make our country a safer place and  to do that in 2017 we need to support those frontline agencies.

CHRIS SMITH:

Two quick questions. An activist group claims two Iranian refugees on Manus were  bashed by a group of PNG police and immigration officials because they were  outside of detention. Do you know much about that and do we launch our own  investigation?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Chris, I would wait to see the full facts of this case. There are lots of advocates  in the refugee space who are completely opposed to offshore detention or stopping  of boats or the Government's policy that has been successful in bringing the people  smugglers to their knees. So they will use any opportunity to say close the centres,  bring people back, allow boats to arrive, all of that nonsense.

We've come up with a policy which is working. It's stopping deaths at sea. We've got  every child out of detention and we've closed 17 detention centres that Labor  opened.

So I would wait to see the facts. If people have had an interaction with the PNG  police on a New Year's Eve night, I would wait to see the full facts of that case before  I'd make any comment to say that they were targeted because they were refugees or  because they were part of the Manus Island population. I would wait to see the  police side of the story before making any comment.

CHRIS SMITH:

The truth might be somewhere in between as we discovered before.

PETER DUTTON:

I think we're better off to wait for the full facts instead of letting the refugee advocates  try and use this as an opportunity to again attack the Government's successful  border protection policy.   CHRIS SMITH:

And your former boss, Tony Abbott, has called for a cut to aid to Palestine, saying it  is paying to support terrorist families with welfare. Your response to that? $40 million  we give Palestine.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Chris, I think Julie Bishop's hit it on the head here when she said that we don't  want to give money to any causes that are supporting any terrorist activities. During  the course of the year she suspended aid to one organisation that was allegedly  involved in all sorts of activities that we wouldn't support.

So our aid should be targeted, it should go to those people that are most in need,  particularly in a region where people are suffering as a result of sanctions or  activities that see people suffer from terrorist acts, all the rest of it.

It's not an ideal world, but we provide aid in a way that is measured and controlled  and if people are acting outside of those parameters then we wouldn't provide aid.

So I think the Government's mindful of all those calls and if people are doing the  wrong thing, they will have their aid cancelled, but at the moment I think the Foreign  Minister's got the balance right and I think she's commented on that to that effect  today.

CHRIS SMITH:

Thank you very much for making yourself available on the public holiday, we do  appreciate it and thank you for addressing some of these issues.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Chris, good to be with you.

CHRIS SMITH:

Yeah, good stuff. Thank you and all the best for 2017 too.

PETER DUTTON:

And to you, thank you.
