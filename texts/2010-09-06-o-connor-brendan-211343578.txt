The Federal Opposition welcomes the decision by Deputy Prime Minister and
the National Party to begin thinking about how Australia could become a
republic.

Once more the National Party is displaying a
willingness to take a position on a potentially difficult public issue when
the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, seems reluctant to do so.

But it
is disappointing that Mr Fischer and the Government still refuse to give an
iron- - clad commitment to providing every Australian a say on the issue
through a vote.

Every Australian should be given a say through
a fair dinkum vote, and that vote should be on a choice between a clearly
identifiable Monarchy and a clearly identifiable Republic proposal. It will
not be good enough to put up a 'Claytons'  Monarchy or a 'Claytons'
Republic.
