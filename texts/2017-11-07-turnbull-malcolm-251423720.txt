Radio interview with Fran Kelly, ABC Radio National Breakfast

SUBJECTS: Citizenship, Illegal Maritime Arrivals, Paradise Papers

**ÃÂ²K**Y

FRAN KELLY:

MPs and senators will be given 21 days to prove they are not citizens of another country under a circuit  breaker plan to end the dual-nationals fiasco which has crippled the Government and undermined trust  in the institution of Parliament. The Prime Minister will meet the Opposition Leader Bill Shorten  tomorrow to discuss what amounts to a citizenship register. It will require all 226 parliamentarians to  prove they have complied with Section 44 of the Constitution. But just moments after the PM disclosed  the new rules, yet another Liberal MP John Alexander was placed under a legal cloud, further  en*****v*P***ÃÂ¥*]*v*P**ÃÂ¶*Z***'*}*Â¿***ÃÂ¥*v*u***v*ÃÂ¶*[*ÃÂª**Â¡***(***ÃÂ¥**ÃÂ¶*Z*]*v**u***i*}*ÃÂ¥*]*ÃÂ¶*Â«*X*d*Z***W*ÃÂ¥*]*u***D*]*v*]*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶***ÃÂ¥**i*}*]*v*ÃÂª**u****]*v**ÃÂ¶*Z*****ÃÂ¥*****l*(***ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶*Âµ***]*}*X* Malcolm Turnbull welcome back to Breakfast.

PRIME MINISTER:

Good morning, Fran. Good to be with you.

FRAN KELLY:

You want all MPs to do a show-and-tell effectively, declare their heritage to Parliament. Are you  prepared for the consequences like this because more disqualifications risks bringing down your  Government?

PRIME MINISTER:

Fran, it is vitally important that we have complete transparency here and that Australians are satisfied  that every member and senator is constitutionally eligible to sit in the Parliament.

The responsibility for satisfying that requirement of course falls on the shoulders of each and every  member of the House and member of the Senate.

So what I've proposed here and as you know, I took this to Cabinet yesterday, and the proposed  resolution that we're going to put to the House and the Senate and I'll discuss with Bill Shorten  tomorrow is one that would require people to declare that they are to the best of their knowledge and  belief, they are not a citizen of any other country, to state where their parents were born, the date of  their birth and if they were a citizen at some point, of another country, for example they were born  overseas, to state how that other citizenship came to an end and provide evidence that it came to an  end.

FRAN KELLY:

And why do you think that is going to be good enough, voluntary disclosure, because-

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, what's the alternative?

FRAN KELLY:

Well, let me just put this to you first-

PRIME MINISTER:

No, no first tell me what is the alternative?

FRAN KELLY:

John Alexander did not disclose his possible dual-citizenship. Stephen Parry advised Cabinet colleagues  but was told to keep quiet. We spoke to Andrew Wilkie yesterday-

PRIME MINISTER:

Well I-

FRAN KELLY:

I just want - if you could listen to what Andrew Wilkie had to say.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yeah okay. I'll listen carefully.

FRAN KELLY:

Because he thinks you've gone a long way towards it but not far enough.

PRIME MINISTER:

Okay, I'll listen carefully.

FRAN KELLY:

This is what he said.

ANDREW WILKIE MP - RECORDING:

Regrettably, I don't have confidence in all members and senators to be fully open and  transparent and honest. No, I don't think we can have confidence that all members and senators  would be honest when it comes to this process.

FRAN KELLY:

So, Andrew Wilkie doesn't trust his colleagues to fess up. Why should anyone else?

PRIME MINISTER:

I think the reality is that you're going to be required to state where your parents were born and the date  of  their birth. That is something that should be within the knowledge *t  I mean there will be some  *ÃÂ¢***}*ÃÂ¢*o****Â¡*Z*}**Â¡*}*v*[*ÃÂ¶**l*v*}*Â¡****Â«**ÃÂ¶*Z****Â¡***Â«****Âµ*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¶*Z****Â¿***ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶**u***i*} rity will know that - that's something that is pretty  hard to, conceal, you know. Most people's ancestry can be readily found. I mean, there is no information  in that form, if you like, relating to me, that is not already in the public domain. That would apply to  many people.

So I think the point Andrew Wilkie is making, he may as well call for an audit of all members' interests.  You know how we have to file a register of our financial interests? From time to time people make  mistakes and have to correct and so forth. Well, if you were to audit that, that would cost tens of  millions of dollars. If you are going to be in a position where you say you do not trust anything any  member of Parliament says in their disclosures, then an auditing process would be, you would literally  be creating a huge audit office.

I think the system of voluntary disclosure with obviously very heavy penalties, political penalties and  personal reputational penalties if people conceal things or don't disclose things honestly; I think that  works and I think it will work well here.

FRAN KELLY:

You said yesterday that you had been assured by the Liberal Party Federal Director, Andrew Hirst that all  Liberal parliamentarians believe they have complied with the Constitution.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes, that's true.

FRAN KELLY:

d*Z***v**Â¡****Z***Â¿****P*}*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¶*Z***:*}*Z*v***o***Ã¢ÂÂ***v*****ÃÂ¥**ÃÂ¥***Â¿***o***ÃÂ¶*]*}*v*X*t***ÃÂ¥****Â«*}*Âµ**ÃÂª*Âµ*ÃÂ¥*ÃÂ¢*ÃÂ¥*]*ÃÂª******ÃÂ¶*Z***ÃÂ¶*:*}*Z*v***o***Ã¢ÂÂ***v*****ÃÂ¥**Z*****v*[*ÃÂ¶********v* prompted to check his citizenship given the whole debate on that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, John Alexander *t  again I don't want to get into the details of any particular case - but John  Alexander has stated publicly and this is what he said to the Party, that he believes he is not a dual-citizen.

FRAN KELLY:

Well, they all believed that. Barnaby Joyce believed that. Fiona Nash believed that.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, Fran that's why we're going to have the public disclosure, complete transparency and then people  will be able to judge. If the Parliament concludes, if after all of this information is out there, if the  Parliament concludes that so many members and so many senators are either not solely Australian  citizens or there is sufficient doubt about it, then they can be referred to the High Court.

Because the High Court is the only place that can determine the qualification of someone to sit in the  Parliament. So this is consistent with the rule of law. It's consistent with our Constitution. It's consistent  with transparency.

FRAN KELLY:

If the Parliament concludes, if the High Court concludes that, you lose your majority on the floor of the  Parliament. Then what do we do?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Fran, it depends what the High Court concludes. I mean you're jumping way ahead.

FRAN KELLY:

No you yourself said there would be line-ball decisions and you just said: "If the High Court concludes."  Well, if it does?

PRIME MINISTER:

Okay, if the High Court concluded there are a number of members of the House of Representatives that  were not eligible to sit in the Parliament, then there would be a series of by-elections. Depending on the  result of the by-elections, that could have consequences for the government. I mean that's obvious.

But the issue here, the issue here is not sort of political partisanship or political tactics. The issue here is  now that we have the High Court's decision, which was not what we expected or had sought, it is a very,  very severely literal reading of the section, which has gone in a different direction to the way in which  *ÃÂ¶*Z******}*Âµ*ÃÂ¥*ÃÂ¶**Z************v**Â¡***ÃÂ¥****ÃÂ¢*ÃÂ¥*}*P*ÃÂ¥***ÃÂª*ÃÂª*]*v*P********l**]*v**ÃÂ±*ÃÂ*[**]*v* Sykes v Cleary. Nonetheless, it's a 7-0 decision. That's  the law. So now that we know what the law is, what we need to do is make sure that everyone is in  compliance with it.

FRAN KELLY:

And now that we know what the law is - let's stick with John Alexander for a moment - because it looks  as though, under the law, he will be a dual-citizen of Britain by descent, unless he can find papers to say  otherwise. If he can't, even though he says he believes he's not, will the government refer John  Alexander to the High Court?

PRIME MINISTER:

Fran, I am not going to start front-running this process. You have got to *t  ***v****Â¡*Z***v*/**ÃÂª***Â«**Z*Â«*}*Âµ*[*U****o*o**}*(**Âµ*ÃÂª* -  all of us have to respect the process that's set up in the Electoral Act and in the Constitution. People  should make their declarations and then cases can be referred.

Obviously, if a member believes that they are a dual-citizen now and are ineligible to sit in the  Parliament, then they should resign. But you know, I take it as a given that every member of the House  and the Senate, as of today, believes that they are eligible to sit in the House or the Senate.

FRAN KELLY:

Have we got a bigger issue here, as Craig Laundy and other Liberal MPs calling for perhaps to think  about perhaps a referendum or something to change this? Because dual-citizenship should be  celebrated in our society, not demonised.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes, okay, thank you. There are two issues here, or two bundles of issues. The first one is dealing with  the Parliament as it is *t  the 45th Parliament.

Are there members of senators that are not qualified to sit there?

The process that I have laid out, I believe, will enable us to reach a determination there.

The second question is what do we do with the future? What do we do with Section 44(1)?

Now, what we argued for in the High Court, which was our advice as to where the court was going to go,  was that a foreign citizenship by descent, through your father or mother or whatever, would not  disqualify you, should not disqualify you, unless you had acknowledged, accepted or acquiesced in it. So  if you had-

FRAN KELLY:

Yeah and the court rejected that.

PRIME MINISTER:

I think that accords with what common sense and what people would understand as being fair.

Now, the court's taken a strictly literal approach and said knowledge is immaterial. What this means, of  course, is that you can potentially, what concerns me, is that potentially people with multicultural  backgrounds, you know, parents from different countries, different ancestry, their ability to stand for  the Australian Parliament in this the most successful multicultural society in the world may be  compromised because they actually can't find out for sure whether they do have the citizenship of  another country.

You see, it's, you know, we've looked at cases where people have had say, in Barnaby's case, a New  Zealand father. Well, that was fairly clear. In Fiona's case, a UK father, that was fairly clear. But there are  a lot of other more complex cases and so, if we get into the situation where somebody is sitting in the  Parli***u***v*ÃÂ¶****v****ÃÂ¶*Z***v**ÃÂª*}*u*****}***Â«****]*ÃÂª***}*Â¿***ÃÂ¥*ÃÂª**ÃÂ¶*Z***ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¶*Z*ÃÂ¥*}*Âµ*P*Z**ÃÂª*}*u******ÃÂ¥*****v****o***Â¡**}*(*U*/****}*v*[*ÃÂ¶**l*v*}*Â¡*U**ÃÂª*}*u******}*Âµ*v*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¥*Â«* in Europe - Bosnian law, for example - that they are arguably a citizen of Bosnia, does that mean they  are turfed out of the Parliament?

Now this is the challenge.

I don't think Australians would welcome - well, I think it's questionable whether Australians would  welcome dual-citizens sitting in their Parliament. I mean Craig has raised that point, it's a fair one. Of

course, in many countries, dual-citizenship, like the UK, is not a bar. But I think the real, I think a more  direct question is, should you be disqualified by a foreign citizenship of which you have no knowledge  and which you have never accepted or acknowledged which was basically the argument that we put and  lost in the High Court.

So in other words when you nominate you should have big red letters, dual-citizenship is not allowed.  Where were you parents born? Have you satisfied yourself of all these things? Really just to make sure  people focus on the issue and do their homework.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well this is in Papua New Guinea as you know.

FRAN KELLY:

In a detention centre we built and we ran.

PRIME MINISTER:

It is a decision by the PNG Supreme Court that that detention centre should close and many people  were calling for it to close.

There are alternative facilities available of a very high quality with food and all of the facilities and the  residents at Manus, at the RPC, they are being asked to move and they should move.

FRAN KELLY:

And they're scared to move. Do you accept that they're scared to move?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, look, I think the reality is, and this is the very sad reality of the case, Fran, is that there are some  activists in Australia, including the Greens Senator Nick McKim who are basically encouraging these  people not to move.

FRAN KELLY:

Well, we've spoken to some of these people directly about their fears.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, I think that the responsible course of action is to encourage them to comply with the lawful  requests and requirements of the PNG authorities.

They have been able - and, of course, as you know, we have secured an arrangement with the United  States which will enable a substantial number to be resettled in the United States.

Those who have been found not to be refugees should return home to their own country.

And we're doing everything we can to ensure that they, people are resettled but they cannot come to  Australia.

The consequence of that is-

FRAN KELLY:

No, I understand your position on that.

Yeah well-

New Zealand has offered to take 150 refugees now. You want to delay that until  the US fulfill their agreement, why?

What is your message to former business  colleagues who believe minimising tax by whatever means possible is just good business practice?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well my message is that we have the toughest anti-multinational tax avoidance provisions in the world,  in the diverted profits tax which imposes a heavy penalty *t  40 per cent tax rate on any profits shifted off  shore.

We passed landmark multinational tax avoidance legislation as you know over a year ago, and that  legislation was opposed by the Labor Party. I have no idea why, but they voted against it. And that is  already seeing profits by some of the big multinationals including companies like Google and so forth  coming back into Australia.

So we are absolutely committed to ensuring that everybody pays their fair share of tax.
