IRAQ: UK DOSSIER ON HUMAN RIGHTS

The United Kingdom Government’s dossier on the Iraqi regime’s human rights record is a timely reminder of why Saddam’s Iraq is in a class of its own when it comes to human rights abuses.

The dossier makes compelling, if grisly, reading.  It highlights the systematic, brutal repression of dissent and the systematic use of torture.  It provides harrowing personal accounts of abuse and mistreatment.  And it underlines the extent to which Saddam has created in Iraq a cradle-to-grave regime of fear.

These concerns are not new to us.  Australia has co-sponsored a resolution in the Commission on Human Rights expressing grave concern over the Iraqi Government's flagrant violation of the human rights of its own citizens every year since 1991.

Our goal - and that of the international community - continues to be disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 sets out a process by which this can be done peacefully and we fully support this process.

But as the dossier reminds us, Iraq is the only state in recent times to have used weapons of mass destruction against its own people.

By moving to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, not only are we addressing a major threat to international security, we are also depriving Saddam of one of his main tools of internal repression.

SADDAM HUSSEIN:  crimes and human rights abuses

“Our quarrel is with Saddam, not the Iraqi people.

They deserve better. Iraq is a country with a very

talented population, a country that is potentially rich

and successful. We want to welcome it back into the

international community. We want the people to be

free to live fulfilling lives without the oppression and

terror of Saddam.”

Prime Minister Tony Blair,

TUC Conference, 10 September 2002

Torture is systematic in Iraq. The most senior

figures in the regime are personally involved.

Saddam Hussein runs Iraq with close members of

his own family and a few associates, most of

whom come from his hometown of Tikrit. These

are the only people he feels he can trust. He

directly controls the security services and,

through them and a huge party network, his

influence reaches deep into Iraqi society. All real

authority rests with Saddam and his immediate

circle. Saddam is head of state, head of

government, leader of Iraq’s only political party

and head of the armed forces.

Saddam presides over the all-powerful

Revolutionary Command Council, which enacts

laws and decrees and overrides all other state

institutions. Several RCC decrees give the

security agencies full powers to suppress dissent

with impunity. An RCC decree of 21 December

1992 guarantees immunity for Ba’ath party

members who cause damage to property, bodily

harm and even death when pursuing enemies of

the regime.

Saddam has, through the RCC, issued a series of

decrees establishing severe penalties (amputation,

branding, cutting off of ears, or other forms of

mutilation) for criminal offences. In mid-2000,

the RCC approved amputation of the tongue as a

Torture

new penalty for slander or abusive remarks about

the President or his family. These punishments

are practised mainly on political dissenters. Iraqi

TV has broadcast pictures of these punishments

as a warning to others.

According to an Amnesty International report

published in August 2001, ‘torture is used

systematically against political detainees. The

scale and severity of torture in Iraq can only

result from the acceptance of its use at the highest

level.’ Over the years, Amnesty and other human

rights organisations have received thousands of

reports of torture and interviewed numerous

torture victims.

Although Iraqi law forbids the practice of torture,

the British Government is not aware of a single

case of an Iraqi official suspected of carrying out

torture being brought to justice.

Iraq is a terrifying place to live. People are in constant fear of being denounced as opponents of the

regime. They are encouraged to report on the activities of family and neighbours. The security services

can strike at any time. Arbitrary arrests and killings are commonplace. Between three and four million

Iraqis, about 15% of the population, have fled their homeland rather than live under Saddam

Hussein’s regime.

These grave violations of human rights are

not the work of a number of overzealous

individuals but the deliberate policy of the

regime. Fear is Saddam’s chosen method

for staying in power.

This report, based on the testimony of Iraqi

exiles, evidence gathered by UN

rapporteurs and human rights

organisations, and intelligence material,

describes the human cost of Saddam

Hussein’s control of Iraq. It examines in

turn Iraq’s record on torture, the treatment

of women, prison conditions, arbitrary and

summary killings, the persecution of the

Kurds and the Shia, the harassment of opposition figures outside Iraq and the occupation of Kuwait.

The United Nations Security Council and the UN Commission on Human Rights have repeatedly, over

many years, condemned Iraq’s human rights record. But Iraq continues to flout UN resolutions and to

ignore its international human rights commitments. On 19 April 2002, the UN Commission on Human

Rights passed a resolution drawing attention to “the systematic, widespread and extremely grave

violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq, resulting in

an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and widespread

terror.”

For 10 years Saddam denied access to the UN Special

Rapporteurs on the human rights situation in Iraq.

However, in February 2002, Andreas Mavrommatis, the

current UN Special Rapporteur, was able to make a brief

visit. Iraqi officials accompanied him everywhere during a

strictly limited programme. It remains to be seen

whether he will be able to return to Iraq to continue his

mission and if he will be given unrestricted access to

enable him to carry out a full, independent assessment of

Iraq’s human rights situation. In his report , dated

20 August 2002, Mr. Mavrommatis regretted that, since

his visit, the Iraqi governmnent were not showing a

sufficient level of cooperation. Iraq still refuses to allow

UN human rights monitors to operate in Iraq, in defiance

of the UN’s demands.

Qusayy Saddam Hussein

Saddam’s younger son. As head of the Iraqi internal security agencies, he has permitted and encouraged the endemic use of torture, including rape and the threat of rape, in Iraq.

(Source: INDICT)

There is first-hand evidence that the Iraqi regime

tortures children. In June, a BBC correspondent,

John Sweeney, visiting the Kurdish safe haven of

northern Iraq, reported the story of Ali, an Iraqi

who used to work for Saddam’s son Udayy.

Some time after the bungled assassination of

Udayy, Ali fell under suspicion. He fled north,

leaving his wife and two-year-old daughter

behind. The secret police came for his wife.

They tortured her to find out where Ali was.

When she did not tell them, they tortured the

daughter, half-crushing her feet. When John

Sweeney met Ali and his daughter two years

later, she was still hobbling. Ali feared that his

daughter had been crippled for life.

Mr Sweeney also met six other witnesses in

northern Iraq with direct experience of child

torture, including another of Saddam’s enforcers

Ã¢ÂÂ now in a Kurdish prison Ã¢ÂÂ who told him that an

interrogator could do anything. ‘We could make

a kebab out of a child if we wanted to’ he told

Mr Sweeney and chuckled.

A Tortured Family : a case brought to the attention of the FCO

A family, arrested in late 2000, were taken to two separate interrogation centres within Republican

Guard facilities located along the road to Abu Ghraib. The husband was held in one centre whilst

the wife and children were held at a women’s facility. The husband and wife were interrogated

under torture about the husband’s sale of a vehicle which, the interrogators said, had been captured

by Iraqi security forces during a raid on Iraqi oppositionists.

The interrogators said separately to both husband and wife that they would cease the torture if they

signed confessions admitting to be collaborating with the oppositionists. They refused. The wife

was stripped naked and cigarettes stubbed out on all parts of her body whenever she refused to

implicate her husband. She was beaten and thrown around the interrogation room. Her children

were forced to watch the torture. She was eventually released, having been told that her husband

would continue being tortured until she returned to confess. She was arrested again two weeks

later and the same pattern of torture was repeated, leaving her a psychological wreck.

During his interrogation, the husband’s arms were tied behind his back and he was then suspended

in the air using a hook hung from the ceiling. This caused intense pain as his shoulder muscles and

ligaments were torn. After a period, the interrogators entered the room and the husband was

unhooked and placed in a chair in the middle of the room. From close range, he was then shot at

with a pistol whenever he refused to agree to sign his confession. Sometimes shots were fired

which missed his body, at other times the pistol muzzle was placed against his fingers, toes or

arms and fired so as to mutilate these areas.

Over the following two weeks further interrogations occurred at intervals, following periods of

food and water deprivation. Eventually the husband’s and wife’s wider family paid a bribe to an

Iraqi Intelligence officer and both the husband and wife were released. They subsequently escaped

from Iraq.

Udayy Saddam Hussein Saddam’s elder son. He has been frequently accused of serial rape and murder of young women.

He maintained a private torture chamber, known as “al-Ghurfa al-Hamra” (the Red Room), disguised as an electricity installation, in a building on the banks of the Tigris

He personally executed dissidents in Basra during the uprising that followed the Gulf War in March 1991.

In one infamous incident of mass torture, Udayy Hussein ordered the national football team to be caned on the soles of their feet after losing a World Cup qualifying match.

As a member of the National Security Council, he bears command responsibility for all crimes committed with the authority or acquiescence of that body.

The treatment of women

Under Saddam Hussein’s regime women lack

even the basic right to life. A 1990 decree

allows male relatives to kill a female relative in

the name of honour without any punishment.

Women have been tortured, ill-treated and in

some cases summarily executed too, according

to Amnesty International. Su’ad Jihad Shams

al-din, a 61 year-old medical doctor, was

arrested in Baghdad on 29 June 1999 on

suspicion that she had contacts with Shia

Islamist groups. The soles of her feet were

beaten during frequent torture sessions before

she was released without charge or trial on 25

July 1999.

Human rights organisations and opposition

groups continue to receive reports of women

who have suffered psychological trauma after

being raped by Iraqi personnel while in custody.

Raping female political prisoners is part of the

regime’s policy, as the box illustrates.

According to Amnesty International, in October

2000, dozens of women accused of prostitution

were beheaded without any judicial process,

together with men accused of pimping. Some of

the victims were reportedly accused for political

reasons and had not been involved in

prostitution. Representatives of the Ba’ath party

and the Iraqi Women’s General Union

witnessed the killings, carried out by members

of the Saddam Fidayeen (the militia created in

1994 by Saddam’s elder son, Udayy Hussein)

using swords to behead victims in front of

their homes.

A Professional Rapist

Government personnel card of Aziz Salih

Ahmed, identified as a “fighter in the

popular army” whose “activity” is

“violation of women’s honour”

(i.e. a professional rapist).

(Source: the Iraq Research and

Documentation Project, Harvard

University)

Nidal Shaikh Shallal was fired from her

government job and her husband was jailed for

four months and tortured by Iraqi military

intelligence. They later had their possessions

confiscated and were expelled from their home

by the Iraqi regime. On 18 October 2002, she

told a meeting of the National Press Club in

Washington about the situation of women in Iraq.

“The Iraqi woman has lost her loved ones Ã¢ÂÂ

husbands, brothers and fathers,” Shallal said.

“The Iraqi woman has endured torture, murder,

confinement, execution, and banishment, just like

others in Iraqi society at the hands of Saddam

Hussein’s criminal gang.”

“The heads of many women have been publicly

cut off in the streets under the pretext of being

liars, while in fact they mostly belonged to

families opposing the Iraqi regime. Members of

Saddam Hussein’s gang have raped women,

especially dissident women. The wives of

dissidents have been either killed or tortured in

front of their husbands in order to obtain

confessions from their husbands. Women have

been kidnapped as they walk in the streets by

members of the gangs of Udayy and Qusayy

[Saddam’s sons] and then raped.”

On a personal level, Shallal said her brother had

been arrested in 1980. Her family still does not

know what happened to him. Several of her

cousins have been executed. 882 male members

of her tribe, the Jibour, have been arrested. Their

fates are unknown.

Saddam Hussein’s Treatment of Women

Amnesty International (2001) Ã¢ÂÂ A 25 year old woman known as Um Haydar was beheaded in the

street without charge or trial at the end of December 2000 after her husband, suspected by the

authorities of involvement in Islamist armed activities, fled the country. Men belonging to Saddam

Fidayeen took Um Haydar from her house in al-Karrada district, in front of her children and

mother-in-law. Two men held her arms and a third pulled her head from behind and beheaded her in

front of the residents. The beheading was also witnessed by the ruling Ba’ath Party in the area. The

security men removed the body and the head in a plastic bag and took away the children and

mother-in-law.

Human Rights Alliance, France (2002) Ã¢ÂÂ A young woman was arrested because her husband had

refused to join the war against Iran. Pregnant at the time, she gave birth in prison on 3 December

1989. “I breast fed my son, but they took him away when he was seventeen days old Ã¢ÂÂ so that he

would not become like me. I am still looking for him, I never had any further news of him”. This

woman, who was also horribly tortured in prison, says she still suffers endless torture: the torture of

not knowing where her son is.

Najat Mohammed Haydar, an obstetrician in Baghdad, was beheaded in October 2000 apparently on suspicion of prostitution, according to Amnesty International. Even by Iraqi standards her execution was an outrage.

There was no evidence to support the charge of prostitution and she was reportedly arrested before the introduction of the policy to behead prostitutes. The real reason for her death was her criticism of corruption in the Iraqi health service.

Conditions for political prisoners in Iraq are

inhumane and degrading. The following

description of prison conditions is based on

British Government sources.

The “Mahjar” prison located on the Police

Training College site in central Baghdad formerly

housed the Police Dog Training Centre. The

normal occupancy of the “Mahjar” is 600-700

people. Thirty of the cells are underground and

thirty other cells used to be dog kennels.

Prisoners are beaten twice a day and the women

regularly raped by their guards. They receive no

medical treatment, but some prisoners have

survived up to a year in the “Mahjar”. Two large

oil storage tanks each with a capacity of 36,000

litres have been built close to the “Mahjar”. The

tanks are full of petrol and are connected by pipes

to the prison buildings in the “Mahjar”. The

prison authorities have instructions to set light to

the petrol and destroy the “Mahjar in an

emergency.

Prison conditions

General ’Abd Hamud, the head of Saddam’s private office,

has played a direct role in supervising prisons and their

security. Both he and Saddam have signed death warrants

for prisoners. The archive files holding these death warrants

were kept hidden within the cafeteria area on the eighth

floor of the main Ministry of Interior building in Baghdad.

Freed Kurdish political prisoner tells story of Baghdad jail

Ra’id Qadir Agha is a member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. He served eight years in

prison. The following is part of a report, in Ra’id’s own words, of his imprisonment Ã¢ÂÂ published

by the Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan newspaper Kurdistani Nuwe on 23 October 2002.

“At first they put me in a compressed room less than one metre high and with the same width. You

couldn’t sleep, nor could you stand in it. You could only sit. The room had been made with a thick

plate with only one hole in the ceiling, through which they would give us water. However, when

the investigations start, you lose your appetite for food, except water, because you are under great

pressure and tension. I remained there for seventeen days.

In sector four (of the prison) they have ten rooms, all painted pitch black. Once there, you could

see nothing and would not know whether it was night or day. For there were no lights in those

rooms. You could hear nothing. The rooms were infested with large numbers of lice and rats.

I spent about eight months in those rooms

We had only one loaf and a half of bread daily with half a glass of soup, actually which was not

soup but only hot water. And in the evening they gave us a gravy of chard. On Thursdays they

would provide us with food that had to last till Saturday. In the evenings they would open the

doors not to let us go out, but to count the prisoners, to see who was dead and who was alive. It

goes without saying, hair cutting or shaving the beard were out of the question and hunger was an

extremely inhumane phenomenon. This condition lasted days, months, and years. Many prisoners

starved to death. For at the beginning you would lose weight and grow lean and skinny. This state

would cause a great deal of pain. Then you would begin to lose hair. Your skin would be affected

in the same way. You would start losing your sight and hearing.”

The “Sijn Al-Tarbut” (the casket prison) is

located on the third underground level of the new

Directorate of General Security (DGS) building

in Baghdad. The prisoners here are kept in rows

of rectangular steel boxes, as found in mortuaries,

until they either confess to their crimes or die.

There are around 100-150 boxes which are

opened for half an hour a day to allow the

prisoners some light and air. The prisoners

receive only liquids.

The “Qurtiyya” (the can) prison is located in a

DGS compound in the Talbiyyah area of the

Saddam City district of Baghdad. This consists of

50-60 metal boxes the size of old tea chests in

which detainees are locked under the same

conditions as the “Sijn Al-Tarbut”. Each box has

a tap for water and a floor made of mesh to allow

the detainees to defecate.

In early 1998, the Iraqi regime obstructed a UN

weapons inspection team which was trying to

investigate claims that Iraq had conducted

biological weapons experiments on prisoners

during the mid-1990s.

Non-Judicial Beheading and Torture (From the Iraq Research and Documentation Project, Harvard University)

Although local commanders have wide latitude to execute prisoners, this commander is rebuked for not interrogating them before killing them.

The document below was issued following the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council’s appointment in March 1987 of Ali Hasan al-Majid as head of all security, military and civil affairs in northern Iraq. Immediately after his appointment the Anfal campaign against the Kurds was launched. The regime pursued its campaign using a range of indiscriminate and lethal methods, including chemical attacks against Kurdish civilians, the destruction of Kurdish villages and executions by beheading.

Executions are carried out without due

process of law. Relatives are often

prevented from burying the victims in

accordance with Islamic practice, and

have even been charged for the

bullets used.

Human rights organisations, such as

Human Rights Watch, and the UN Special

Rapporteur on the human rights situation

in Iraq have reported the phenomenon of

killing inmates in order to ‘cleanse’ the

prisons. In 1984, 4,000 political prisoners

were executed at a single prison, the Abu

Ghraib. An estimated 2,500 prisoners

were executed between 1997 and 1999 in

a further “prison cleansing” campaign. In

February 2000, 64 male prisoners were

executed at Abu Ghraib, followed in

March by a further 58, all of whom had

previously been held in solitary

confinement. In October 2001, 23 political

prisoners, mainly Shia Muslims, were

executed at Abu Ghraib.

Between 1993 and 1998 around 3,000

prisoners from the “Mahjar” prison were

executed in an execution area called the

“Hadiqa” (garden) near to the prison. The

“Hadiqa” consisted of an open area and

sand bank that was covered by a steel

awning. Prisoners from the “Mahjar” were

executed in the “Hadiqa” by machine gun.

A Special Oversight Committee at the

prison decided on the executions.

Ra’id Qadir Agha, the member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, whose experience of prison is given on page 11, recalls vividly the execution of prisoners.

“Also, on the day after Udayy (Saddam’s son) was shot at, the death chamber section had more than 800 prisoners in it. You could see things for yourself from the rooms which overlooked the solitary section. It happened that the inmates of those two rooms, during that night, would draw a line on the wall for every dead body they saw taken out. Thus that very night more than 2000 prisoners were put to death. For they had brought a guillotine that beheaded 12 by 12, that is, twenty-four prisoners per minute.”

Persecution of the Kurds

Under Saddam’s rule, Iraq’s Kurdish communities have experienced terrible suffering.

Documents captured by the Kurds during the Gulf War and handed over to the non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch provided much information about Saddam’s persecution of the Kurds. They detail the arrest and execution in 1983 of 8,000 Kurdish males aged 13 and upwards.

Amnesty International in 1985 drew attention to reports of hundreds more dead and missing, including the disappearance of 300 Kurdish children arrested in Sulaimaniya, of whom some were tortured and three died in custody.

In 1988, Iraqi government forces systematically razed Kurdish villages and killed civilians.

Amnesty International estimates that over 100,000 Kurds were killed or disappeared during 1987-1988, in an operation known as the Anfal campaigns, to quell Kurdish insurgency and activities.

The campaign included the use of chemical weapons. According to Human Rights Watch, a single attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja killed up to 5,000 civilians and injured some 10,000 more.

Ali Hasan al-Majid “Chemical Ali”

As commander for the northern region, he bears direct command responsibility for the chemical weapons attack on the town of Halabja in northern Iraq which resulted in the death of up to 5,000 people.

He also took a leading role in the brutal repression of the uprising that followed the Gulf War in 1991, which included mass executions, torture and widespread destruction.

(Source: INDICT)

Persecution of Iraq’s Kurds continues today, although the protection provided by the northern No Fly Zone has curbed the worst excesses. Saddam’s regime is pursuing a policy of Arabisation in the north of Iraq to dilute Kurdish claims to the oil-rich area around the city of Kirkuk. Kurds and other non-Arabs are forcibly relocated from there to other parts of Iraq.

The UN Special Rapporteur reports claims by Kurdish opposition sources that 94,000 individuals have been expelled from their

homes since 1991. Agricultural land owned by Kurds is said to have been confiscated and redistributed to Iraqi Arabs. Arabs from southern Iraq have been offered incentives to move into the Kirkuk area and, in disputes with their Kurdish neighbours, are always favoured by the authorities.

In addition, ethnic Kurds and Turcomans have been prevented from buying property and those who own property and wish to sell have to find an Arab buyer.

Kurds have also been coerced into changing the ethnicity on their identity cards to Arab as part of this process. Turcomans are not even allowed to register as such. They must call themselves either Kurdish or Arab.

Harassment of the Opposition outside Iraq

The UN Special Rapporteur has received

numerous reports of harassment, intimidation and

threats against the families of opposition

members living abroad.

In mid-February 1999, the brother of a senior

London-based member of the Iraqi National

Accord (INA) was arrested by Iraqi Intelligence

(the Mukhabarat) in Basra and forced to phone

his brother in the UK and explain his

predicament. A Mukhabarat officer subsequently

spoke to the INA member in London and

demanded that he co-operate with the

Mukhabarat. The implication for his brother’s

well-being was clear.

In January 1999, the Mukhabarat phoned another

INA official, who was told that his children and

brother were under arrest in Iraq and would face

punishment if he did not co-operate with the

Mukhabarat. The Mukhabarat demanded details

of the home, car and routines of INA head Dr

Ayad Allawi. Iraqi intelligence has made at least

one attempt to assassinate Dr Allawi.

From an interim report of the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iraq

General Najib al-Salihi, a senior officer in the

Iraqi Army, left the country in 1995 to live in

Jordan where he became an active member of

the Iraqi opposition. After his departure, his

male and female relatives in Iraq were

subjected to arrests, questioning and other

forms of harassment. His brother was forced

to travel twice to Jordan to try and persuade

him to return to Iraq.

General al-Salihi reported that on 7 June 2000

he received a telephone call from Baghdad and

was told to go and collect a “gift” from a store

in Amman. This consisted of a video tape

showing the rape of a female family member.

Ten days later he reportedly received a call

from the Iraqi Intelligence Service. He was

asked if he had received the gift and was told

that one of his female family members was in

the hands of Iraqi Intelligence. He was then

again urged to stop his activities. General

al-Salihi, during an interview with the Special

Rapporteur, stated that he was willing to

surrender the video tape only at the trial of a

top Iraqi government official.

Persecution of the Shia community

The Shia community, who make up 60% of Iraq’s

population, is Iraq’s biggest religious group.

Saddam has ensured that none of the Shia

religious or tribal leaders is able to threaten his

position. He kills any that become too prominent.

In April 1980, a leading Iraqi Shia cleric,

Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, was

executed. Many members of another leading

clerical family, the al-Hakim, were arrested in

May 1983 and executed. Another member of this

family, Sayyid Mahdi al-Hakim, was murdered in

Khartoum in January 1988.

More than 100 Shia clerics have disappeared

since the 1991 uprising. Sayyid Muhammad Taqi

al-Khoie was killed in a staged car accident in

July 1994. Following the assassination in 1998 of

two leading Shia clerics, Grand Ayatollah Shaykh

Mirza Ali al-Gharawi and Ayatollah Shaykh

Murtada al-Burujerdi, the UN Special Rapporteur

reported his fears that this formed part of a

systematic attack on the independent leadership

of Shia Muslims in Iraq.

In early 1999, during a peaceful demonstration in

response to the Iraqi regime’s murder of the most

senior Shia cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid

Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, security forces fired

into the crowd of protestors, killing hundreds of

civilians, including women and children. Security

forces were also involved in efforts to break-up

Shia Friday prayers in Baghdad and other cities.

Large numbers of Shia were rounded up,

imprisoned without trial and tortured. In May

2001, two more Shia clerics were executed in

Baghdad for publicly accusing the regime of the

Grand Ayatollah’s murder.

In response to attacks on government buildings

and officials in southern Iraq during 1999, the

Iraqi army and militia forces destroyed entire

Shia villages in the south.

During the 1990s, Saddam pursued a policy of

draining the marshes area of southern Iraq so

forcing the population to relocate to urban areas

where it was less able to offer assistance to anti-regime elements and could be controlled more

effectively by the regime’s security forces. As an

UN Environment Programme report put it Ã¢ÂÂ ‘The

collapse of Marsh Arab society, a distinct

indigenous people that has inhabited the

marshlands for millennia, adds a human

dimension to this environmental disaster. Around

40,000 of the estimated half-million Marsh Arabs

are now living in refugee camps in Iran, while the

rest are internally displaced within Iraq. A 5,000-year-old culture, heir to the ancient Sumerians

and Babylonians, is in serious jeopardy of

coming to an abrupt end.’

Barzan al-Tikriti Saddam’s half brother. Personally responsible for the detention and/or murder of several thousand male members of the Barzani tribe in 1983. While head of Iraqi Intelligence (the Mukhabarat) 1979-1983, he was responsible for the repression of religious and ethnic minorities, including forced deportation, disappearances and murder.

Linked to the arrest of 90 members of the al-Hakim family and the murder of at least six of them.

The Looting of Kuwait (Source: Centre for Research and Studies on Kuwait)

This document shows the organised way Iraq  looted Kuwait

19/2/1991

Mr. Ali Hasan al-Majid

Minister of Localities

The President and Leader has instructed the Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialisation to transport from the governorate of Kuwait all possible materials, plant and equipment that can be carried which could contribute to the reconstruction of the networks of public services and whatever is required to get them running again. We have charged a working party to carry out the initial survey to determine what is required and to set about work immediately.

The working party will be headed by Brigadier Engineer Mohammed Lutfi al-Imam.

Please note this and offer all possible assistance to facilitate his task. With thanks and regards, Victory will be ours, with God’s will.

General Hussein Kamil Hasan

Minister of Industry and Military Industrialisation and acting Minister of Oil

Occupation of Kuwait

Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990. Iraqi

forces committed robbery, raped Kuwaitis and

expatriates, and carried out summary executions.

Amnesty International documented many other

abuses during the occupation of Kuwait.

Iraq denied access to the Red Cross, which has a

mandate to provide protection and assistance to

civilians affected by international armed conflict.

As Iraq tried to impose its own identity on the

occupied territory, Kuwaiti civilians were arrested

for “crimes” such as wearing beards. People were

dragged from their homes and held in improvised

detention centres. In findings based on a large

number of interviews, Amnesty International

listed 38 methods of torture used by the Iraqi

occupiers, including beatings, breaking of limbs,

extracting finger and toenails, inserting bottle

necks into the rectum, and subjecting detainees to

mock executions.

More than 600 Kuwaiti and third country

nationals remain unaccounted for. The British

Government believe some were still alive in

1998. Iraq refuses to comply with its UN

obligation to account for the missing. It has failed

to provide sufficient information to close more

than three of the 600 or so files.

In an attempt to deter military action to expel it

from Kuwait, the Iraqi regime took hostage

several hundred foreign nationals (including

children) in Iraq and Kuwait, and prevented

thousands more from leaving. Worse still,

hostages were held as human shields at a number

of strategic military and civilian sites, many in

inhumane conditions. These acts were in

violation of international law Ã¢ÂÂ the Fourth

Geneva Convention, to which Iraq is a party Ã¢ÂÂ as

was confirmed in United Nations Security

Council resolutions 670 and 674.

At the end of the Gulf

War, the Iraqi army

fleeing Kuwait set fire

to some 1,160

Kuwaiti oil wells,

with serious

environmental

consequences.

Aziz Salih al-Nu’man

As Governor of Kuwait during the latter part of the occupation, November 1990 Ã¢ÂÂ February 1991, he bears responsibility for grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention (Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War) committed by Iraqi forces during that period, including murder, torture, rape and deportation.

ANNEX ONE

Saddam Hussein’s Regime’s Methods of Torture

The following methods of torture have all been reported to international human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, by the victims of torture or their families.

Eye gouging

Amnesty International reported the case of a Kurdish businessman in Baghdad who was executed in 1997. When his family retrieved his body, the eyes had been gouged out and the empty eye sockets stuffed with paper.

Piercing of hands with electric drill

A common method of torture for political detainees. Amnesty International reported one victim who then had acid poured into his open wounds.

Suspension from the ceiling

Victims are blindfolded, stripped and suspended for hours by their wrists, often with their hands tied behind their backs. This causes dislocation of shoulders and tearing of muscles and ligaments.

Electric shock

A common torture method. Shocks are applied to various parts of the body, including the genitals, ears, tongue and fingers.

Sexual abuse

Victims, particularly women, have been raped and sexually abused, including reports of broken bottles being forced into the victim’s anus.

"Falaqa"

Victims are forced to lie face down and are then beaten on the soles of their feet with a cable, often losing consciousness.

Other physical torture

Extinguishing cigarettes on various parts of the body, extraction of fingernails and toenails and beatings with canes, whips, hose pipes and metal rods are common.

Mock executions

Victims are told that they are to be executed by firing squad and a mock execution is staged.

Victims are hooded and brought before a firing squad, who then fire blank rounds.

Acid baths

David Scheffer, US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes, reported that photographic evidence showed that Iraq had used acid baths during the invasion of Kuwait. Victims were hung by their wrists and gradually lowered into the acid.

Conclusion

This dossier does not include every Iraqi’s personal story of suffering, caused by Saddam’s regime,

known to the British Government. There are sadly far too many to mention them all. But the evidence in

the dossier is a faithful representation of what ordinary Iraqis face in their daily lives. It is no wonder

that, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2001, Iraqis have become the

second largest group of refugees in the world. Iraqis also top the table of foreign nationals seeking

asylum in the UK.

Saddam Hussein has been ruthless in his treatment of any opposition to him since his rise to power in

1979. A cruel and callous disregard for human life and suffering remains the hallmark of his regime.

ANNEX THREE

List of Chemical Attacks in Iraq from 1987-88 (based on Human Rights Watch Ã¢ÂÂ GENOCIDE IN IRAQ report)

Human Rights Watch carried out extensive research into chemical weapons attacks in northern

Iraq. Based on field interviews, they reckon at least sixty villages, as well as the town of Halabja,

were attacked with mustard gas, nerve gas, or a combination of the two in the Anfal campaign

against the Kurds between 1987-88.

Human Rights Watch say that the Iraqi regime have used chemical weapons for at least four

complementary purposes:

(a) to attack base camps and main-force concentrations of Kurdish guerrillas.

(b) to harass and kill retreating guerrillas

(c) to inflict exemplary collective punishment on civilians for their support for the

guerrillas. The most dramatic case is the chemical bombing of Halabja after the

seizure of the town by guerrillas and Iranian revolutionary guards.

(d) to spread terror amongst the civilian population as a whole, flushing villagers out

of their homes to facilitate their capture, relocation and killing.

While a distinction between these different kinds of targets is helpful in understanding the tactical

thinking behind the Iraqi campaign, it is without meaning in legal terms. Chemical weapons are by

their nature indiscriminate, and their use is outlawed under any circumstances.

ANNEX TWO

Saddam Hussein: Costs to Fellow Muslims

The Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) resulted in an estimated 1 million Muslim casualties, dead and

wounded. Iranian casualties were estimated at between 450,000 and 730,000. Iraqi casualties

were estimated at between 150,000 and 340,000.

During the 1988 Anfal campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iraqi troops were responsible for the death or

disappearance of up to 100,000 Muslim Kurds.

On March 16 1988, Iraqi troops killed up to 5,000 and injured some 10,000 Muslim Kurds in a

single day in a chemical weapon attack on the town of Halabja in northern Iraq.

The 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait led to the death of some 1,000 Kuwaiti Muslim nationals.

605 prisoners of war remain unaccounted for since 1991, including nationals of Kuwait, Saudi

Arabia, India, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Bahrain, and Oman.

Between 3 and 4 million Muslim Iraqis have abandoned their homes and sought refuge outside Iraq.

Many hundreds of thousands of Iraq’s Muslimshave been displaced internally. Estimates of 900,000 may be conservative. In the north, towns and villages were systematically destroyed by

the regime during the war with Iran. Further south, non-Arabs in the region of Kirkuk have been

relocated to other parts of Iraq and Arabs induced to occupy their homes and lands. And in the

south, between 300,000 and 500,000 Muslim citizens have been forced from their traditional

homes in Iraq’s marshlands.

Thousands of Muslims have been arbitrarily arrested, ill-treated, tortured and executed in Iraq

in recent years because of their suspected opposition political activities, or because they are

relatives of people sought by the authorities.
