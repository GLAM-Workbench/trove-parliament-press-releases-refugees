Greens welcome Howard staying put

Senator Brown, 31st July 2006

The Greens are delighted that John Howard will lead the Coalition into the 2007  election, Greens Leader Bob Brown said today.

"With Labor trying to shadow John Howard on issues like uranium mining and  burning coal, the Greens' vote will grow," Senator Brown said.

"However buoyant the economy, this is an era of nastiness for Australia   - as in mistreating refugees, removing protection for workers, denying David Hicks  access to Australian courts and environmental deterioration.   The Greens will tackle Howard all the way to the ballot box."

"Deciding who has control of the Senate will be a vital issue at the next election. Our  campaign will be 'Rescue the Senate!'," said Senator Brown.
