TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH MRS LOUISE MARKUS MHR,   FEDERAL MEMBER FOR MACQUARIE,  SOUTH WINDSOR, NEW SOUTH WALES

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here at this marvellous centre which is run by the YMCA. It’s good to be with Louise  Markus, the local member and a big supporter of this centre. I’m also delighted that Margie has been able to  join me today. Margie of course works professionally with children and obviously it’s good for her to see  what’s happening with child care in other areas.

This is a very important local centre. Every year about 300,000 people use this centre. It’s important that we  don’t make life harder for this centre and for the people who use it and of course every year this centre  spends some $300,000 on utilities. Now, these bills are going to go up and up and up under Labor’s carbon  tax and a centre like this is going to face more and more costs that it just doesn’t need. We all know that in  outer metropolitan Sydney in particular families are doing it tough. The last thing that the forgotten families  of western Sydney need is this toxic tax which is going to impact on all of their costs. There is hardly a cost  in our community that won’t be impacted by Labor’s toxic tax.

I’m just going to say a few words about the tax summit then I’m going to ask Louise to say a few words  about the centre.

Look, all of us want to see a good outcome from the tax forum now taking place in Canberra but what we  know is that this Government is not a tax fighter it’s a tax hiker. The problem with this forum is that it looks  like just another pointless talkfest from an embarrassingly incompetent government. Just when you thought  this Government couldn’t get any worse, they have a tax summit that isn’t allowed to talk about Labor’s big  new taxes.

So, I just think that this is going to go the same way as the Henry tax review which took a year to do, cost a  million dollars and came out with hundreds of recommendations of which only a handful were adopted; and  like the 2020 Summit which came up with 962 ideas of which only nine were actioned. So, as I said, it  strikes me as just another pointless talkfest from a Government which we know from its record is not a tax  fighter it’s a tax hiker.

Louise?

LOUISE MARKUS:

Thank you, Tony. I’d just like to thank Tony and Margie for being here today. I’d like to particularly  acknowledge the work of the YMCA at the Oasis centre here, they do a great job. They invest in the younger  generation particularly from nought to 15 and primary school aged children have a ball here. It was great to  spend time with them today. Can I just say that on behalf of my local community that will be impacted by  this carbon tax, centres like this will not be better off, they will have to make decisions that will put either  prices up or will have to see a reduction in staff and can I say on behalf of my community and centres like  this I’ll be fighting to ensure that they get a government that will make decisions that improve the  opportunities for both the centre and the people that they serve.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Louise. Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, is that why you’re not attending the conference in Canberra and do you not feel it’s a worthy  debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we didn’t get invited. I mean, this is basically designed to make the Government look good. They’re  spending almost $1 million to stage what I think is going to be in the end a pretty pointless PR stunt and the  last thing they wanted to do was to invite the Coalition. Now, it’s pretty clear that if you want to get taxes  down you’ve got to get spending down and were I invited to the summit I’d say that essentially there are  three things: you’ve got to get wasteful government spending down, you’ve got to stop the unnecessary new  taxes and you’ve got to get our economy more productive. I’ve been talking about my six point plan for a  more productive economy. We need to get more people into the workforce, we need to get more effective  and efficient public institutions, we need to cut red tape, we need to get our competition policy right, we  need to get better value for infrastructure spending and we need more productive and more effective and  more flexible workplaces. Now, that’s my six point plan and I think if the Government were serious about  lower, simpler, fairer taxes it would get its own wasteful spending under control and it would be serious  about a more productive economy.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Wayne Swan says he did invite you or anyone from the Liberal Party to come along.

TONY ABBOTT:

Not true.

QUESTION:

So are you saying that he’s lying about inviting people, the Liberal Party, along to the forum?

TONY ABBOTT:

We were never invited, simple as that.

QUESTION:

You say spending cuts need to be made. Where do you suggest those cuts need to be made?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ll be giving people our full fiscal plan in good time before the next election but just look at our record.  In government we turned a $96 billion debt into $70 billion worth of net commonwealth assets. We took a  $10 billion budget black hole and turned it into a $20 billion surplus. What this Government has done it’s  turned the $20 billion surplus into a $50 billion deficit and it’s turned the $70 billion worth of net  commonwealth assets into a $100 billion net commonwealth debt position. So, we have the record when it  comes to getting spending under control and people will see in good time that what we did before we can  and will do again.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, had you been invited would you have gone along?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the fact is I wasn’t invited and I don’t believe in gatecrashing events that I’m not invited to.

QUESTION:

They said if someone was willing to be positive about it that they could come along. Would you have gone  along if you had, would you have pushed to come along instead of being all the way out here?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important that senior politicians listen to the community and I think that if the Prime  Minister was listening to the community she would get one very loud and clear message: drop this toxic tax.  I mean, how can you have a tax forum credibly that does not discuss the two big new taxes that this  Government wants to hit us with? I mean, really and truly, how can you be serious about reducing taxes  when you’re just about to hit us with a carbon tax and a mining tax?

QUESTION:

And why was it more important for you to be here rather than to be at the forum?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what’s the point of going to a forum which isn’t allowed to discuss the Government’s two big new tax  increases? I mean, what’s the point of going to a forum which is supposed to be about discussing tax where  all the important new taxes that this Government wants to hit us with are off the agenda?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you think about the new ads funded by the ALP claiming that you perhaps don’t care  about asylum seeker policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that it’s just more pathetic spin from a desperate government. I mean, they can’t spin their way  out of four years of policy failure with two weeks of advertising.

QUESTION:

And what about the claims this morning that there’s a lot of money being spent on tobacco for asylum  seekers?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, if you stop the boats you stop the smokes, don’t you.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what should they be talking about at the forum today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, any government which is serious about helping Australians with their tax burden would not  be hitting them up with a carbon tax and frankly there should be no carbon tax without an election. At the  very least there should be no carbon tax without an election and I think this carbon tax, it’s the wrong tax at  the wrong time, it’s a bad tax from a bad government and if they were fair dinkum about democracy they  wouldn’t be trying to sneak it through a parliament that’s got no mandate.

QUESTION:

The Greens say you can’t be a credible Opposition if you’re not at this tax summit.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Greens are a part of the government so of course they’re there because they support the mining  tax, they want it to be higher; they support the carbon tax, they want it to be bigger. I mean, we’re only  getting a carbon tax because the Prime Minister was forced to have one by the Greens after the election and  one of the reasons why this Government is so unpopular is because you can’t say one thing before an  election to win votes and do the opposite after the election to stay in The Lodge which is what unfortunately  Julia Gillard has done.

QUESTION:

There are some suggestions for a congestion tax on roads, cuts to company rates, these sorts of things that  have been talked about. What’s your stand on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’re against it. Look, we don’t believe in new taxes. We believe in trying to get existing taxes down. We  want lower, simpler, fairer taxes and the only way you can get lower, simpler, fairer taxes is to get the  Government waste under control and that’s what we think this tax forum should be about.

QUESTION:

Well if that’s what you think it should be about are you suggesting that you might hold your own tax forum?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we’ve certainly got a tax seminar coming up which is being hosted by the Menzies Research Centre in  coming months but the essential point is that you just can’t expect anything good to come from a tax forum  organised by a government which has a consistent record as a tax hiker not a tax fighter.
