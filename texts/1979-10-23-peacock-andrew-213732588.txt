UNITED NATIONS DAY

Tomorrow, 24 October, is the thirty-fourth anniversary  of the entry into force in San Francisco of the United Nations  Charter. The current session of the General Assembly will mark  the end of a decade which has produced significant changes in  the Organisation from that envisaged in 1943.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock,  said today that United Nations Day provided Australians with  an opportunity- to renew their commitment to the ideals of the  United Nations and its Charter.

The Minister noted that the United Nations was moving  into the 1980's with a widely recognised requirement to face  new challenges and to accept new responsibilities. He said that  it was increasingly accepted that the main international economic  problems would require new approaches, and he noted that the

Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly to be held  in 1980 would need to draw up the blueprint for the new interÂ­ national development strategy to guide the work of the UN in the  economic field over the next ten years.

Mr Peacock said that he shared with others around the  world the opinion that the United Nations was becoming more  relevant than ever as a forum in which these great issues could  be debated and resolved. He said that the Organisation deserved

the support of all Australians as it approached these issues in  the year and decade to come.

Mr Peacock said that 1980 would be an important year  for international social issues. The World Conference, which  will mark the mid-point of the UN Decade for Women, will provide  an dpportunity to assess the experience of the last five years

and to set the course until 1985. The Minister observed that,  in view of the celebration of 1979 as the UN International Year  of the Child, it was especially appropriate that United Nations  Day should coincide, as it does this year in Australia, with  Universal Children's Day.
