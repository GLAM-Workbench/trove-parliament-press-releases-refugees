E & OE…

MICHAEL ROWLAND

The Opposition Climate Action spokesman joins us now from Canberra, good morning  Greg Hunt.

GREG HUNT

Good morning Michael.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

The Minister [Combet] does have a point: this has got to be the most exhaustively debated  issue in Federal politics this year. What is wrong with the legislative timetable the  Government has set down?

GREG HUNT

Well the Government is allowing approximately one minute per member per bill for debate.  This is an extraordinary turn in democratic process. Essentially what’s occurring here is  that the Prime Minister, as we all know, broke her election promise; she wants to submit  that legislation that follows from that broken promise to as little scrutiny as possible. The  idea of major rises in electricity, gas and groceries being submitted to one minute per  member per bill is an extraordinary turn of events.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

But there are bills and there are bills. There are 18 bills to set up the carbon tax but some  bills are more important than others, we both know that. But looking at the timetable, the  House of Representatives vote has been scheduled for October 12, that is a month away.  The Senate vote is a few weeks after that. Surely there’s plenty of time for every member,  every senator to have their say?

GREG HUNT

Well in real time that’s less than two hours per bill. There’s 150 members of Parliament.  Let’s assume that one in five doesn’t speak, that’s one minute per member per bill. And  what does that mean? It means the ability to explore the fact that the Government hasn’t  even produced modelling with the correct carbon price will get very little chance to be  debated. How can it be that the Prime Minister promised that she would get the correct

carbon price modelled, the legislation comes into Parliament today and the correct carbon  price has not been modelled. And even now, the basic figures are set down on the wrong  carbon price.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

The carbon tax compensation package, it hasn’t been modelled on $23 a tonne?

GREG HUNT

Well the Government’s modelling - page 18 of the summary modelling - makes it  absolutely clear that it is a $20 macroeconomic model…

MICHAEL ROWLAND

Macroeconomic modelling - but we’re talking about the compensation, which is what the  voters are very interested in, that has been modelled on $23 a tonne.

GREG HUNT

The basic carbon price is the wrong carbon price. There’s no debate, no doubt, no denial,  no question that the Government’s own modelling is based on $20 and that is an  extraordinary situation where the Prime Minister can’t even get the price of her carbon tax  right.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

How is it looking for the Coalition? It’s not looking that well because the Government does  seem to have the numbers to get the various bills through the lower house and the upper  house. Is this now a fait accompli?

GREG HUNT

No. there’s no bill, no legislation in this Parliament which is a done deal until the vote is  complete. But we know that there is significant division, not just within the Caucus but also  within the Cabinet of the ALP. There is every prospect of re-thinking. And even if that  doesn’t come to pass, our position is very clear. We will repeal and replace the legislation  at the next election if it passes. The next election will be a real referendum on this  legislation and we say to the members of the ALP ‘it is not too late to stand by your  election commitment and to stand by the Prime Minister’s pledge that there won’t be a  carbon tax under the Government that she leads’.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

While we are talking legislation, Greg Hunt, do you believe in the principle of executive  government authority?

GREG HUNT

Well the executive is always subject to the Parliament, and the Parliament is subject to the  Constitution. So they’re not untrammelled.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

It’s fundamental Liberal Party policy, isn’t it? Observing that there is a fundamental  principle of executive government.

GREG HUNT

Well actually the fundamental Liberal Party principle is that the executive is subject to the  Parliament and the Parliament is subject to the Constitution.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

For a government to - obviously talking about the asylum seeker situation, the Malaysia  deal response the Government has put up. The Government, though, has the numbers. It’s  been elected, it hopes to get this legislation through the Parliament, why won’t the  Coalition support what the Government has put up to get around the High Court ruling  yesterday?

GREG HUNT

Well the Government is always asking us to give them blank cheques. They asked for that  on the Pink Batts program, on the Green Loans program. They said it will all be fine. It  wasn’t fine. When you come to the practice of dumping people offshore with inadequate  human rights protections, we don’t accept that. We think there is a humane and effective  way of dealing with this issue. We don’t want people to drown enroute to Australia and that  is the reality, that is the truth, that is what occurs at present. When people come, we have  seen tragedies at sea, we have lost human lives and we want that to stop. You can do that  most effectively by looking at what’s occurred effectively in Nauru, not by simply dumping  people where there are inadequate human rights protections and we make no apologies for  that combination of being effective, but also humane.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

Briefly, if the Opposition, though, doesn’t agree to support this legislation, won’t you  effectively be cutting your nose off to spite your face because if this legislation goes down,  so too does the concept of off-shore processing.

GREG HUNT

We support off-shore processing and we support good solutions, not bad solutions. What  this Government does is it tries to be incredibly clever and tricky by tacking one good idea  to a bad idea and we will just simply stand for the good ideas and the good suggestions. We  want Australian control, we want Australian standards, we want Australian protections in  place and that’s why we have designed systems which were effective and fair and humane  in the past and that’s what we’ll stand for in the future.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

Even though the Government officials briefing your Leader last week were saying that  Nauru simply won’t work, it’s not effective.

This Government sets up officials to do the dirty work and they get the answers to the  questions they seek. So they had answers that the Home Insulation Program would be fine.  It wasn’t. they had answers that the Green Loans program would be fine. It wasn’t. They  define their own questions and misuse the officials. I don’t blame the officials. I say that  this is a Government which has very little respect for the proper separation of powers and  the proper role of the bureaucracy. They put the bureaucracy in an impossible position.  They need to stand up and take responsibility, not hide behind officials who have very little  choice other than to back the Government of the day.

MICHAEL ROWLAND

Greg Hunt in Canberra, thank you very much for your time this morning.

GREG HUNT

Thank you.
