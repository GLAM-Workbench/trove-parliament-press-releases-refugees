JOHN BURGESS:

Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Burgo, good to be with you.

JOHN BURGESS:

Nice to have you on. What are you up to today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I have got meetings and Liberal Party events as you would expect. I will also have something to say  about the illegal boat arrival problem which obviously was highlighted by the arrival just a week or so back  of that boat in Geraldton Harbour. So, it’s another day in the countdown - the interminable countdown to the  election in September - and every day I will be holding a bad government to account and every day I will be  doing my best to persuade people that there is a better way; that they can have hope, reward and opportunity  again under a Coalition government.

JOHN BURGESS:

I know that there is no simplistic answer to do this problem and we have had such an increase in numbers  and what have you, but surely to goodness, can’t we do something about the source? I mean they’re just  leaving Indonesia willy nilly.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and look the Howard Government inherited a problem and it created a solution. The current  government inherited a solution and has created a problem. What we need to do is first of all reintroduce  temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell. We have got to have rigorous  offshore processing at Nauru and elsewhere and illegal arrivals have got to expect to go to these places. We  have got to have the option of turning boats around where it is safe to do so. Obviously, John, we have got to

improve our relations with Indonesia. These have been in the cellar since the live cattle export ban and since  the megaphone diplomacy over the Oceanic Viking. John Howard and Philip Ruddock and Alexander  Downer had good relations with Indonesia and an incoming Coalition government can have good relations  again.

JOHN BURGESS:

Well, I know that we are going to hear a lot more about it as we lead up to September of course. Just on the  subject of numbers, Tony. I know you are flat out this morning but I was just looking at your footy tips for  last week and you were a guest tipster in the West Australian as I am as well. You are trailing me slightly,  Tony, by the way.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Burgo you were born to the game in a way that I wasn’t and also not being a politician you are  probably freer to tip on form! I have to tip my favourite team which is GWS and of course GWS don’t have  any wins under their belt. I normally tip Sydney although I didn’t this weekend and it was a thrilling win to  the Cats this weekend.

JOHN BURGESS:

Yes, well I tipped Sydney. So, you got me there but GWS, well, they’re building and building and Sheeds  and the guys there are doing a good job.

TONY ABBOTT:

They are going to be a good team in the years to come. Like, all new teams it takes time to develop a strong  nucleus of players. It takes time to build up a team ethos and esprit de corps and it takes time to build up a  fan base because western Sydney, let’s face it, is Rugby League territory to the extent that if it’s not Rugby  League it is Soccer and Rugby Union. Aussie Rules is really a bit of a new game for western Sydney. It is a  great game and I am sure it will take off over time.

JOHN BURGESS:

Good to talk to you as always. I hope you have a very pleasant stay here in Perth and we look forward to  talking soon, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Burgo.
