MORE FAMILIES BELOW POVERTY LINE AFTER TAJC AND PENSION CHANGES

Readers of the December issue of the 1  Social Security Bulletin1   will recall a table identifying very low income families with  children whose disposable incomes were close to or below the  poverty line.

When the Government announced its tax changes, increasing  rebates for dependent spouses and sole parents, we asked the  Parliamentary Library Research Service to provide figures'which  would show how those same families would fare under the new

arrangements, taking into account the 1 May pension rises and  the updated June poverty line.

The attached comparison, setting out the spending power of  families after tax has been taken out and family allowances  added, shows their position worsening between December 1979  and July 1980. Though some working families will have received

the increased spouse rebate and pensioner families will have  their pensions indexed, those rises will not have kept pace with  living standards. The more children in the family, the more  their standard of living will drop.

The Government is trying to mislead the public by the use of  dubious repetition - e.g.

".. the Government has responded to what it believes to be  the relative disadvantage of single income families -  particularly those on low incomes - under present taxation  arrangements." (John Howard, Treasurer)

".. the major benefit (is) going to single-income families -  particularly those on low incomes - under present taxation  arrangements".  (Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister)

"The large increase in the spouse rebate shows our concern  for Australian families,  particularly the lower, single  income families." (Eric Robinson, Minister for Finance)

The repetition technique is used to cloud the Government's  generosity to the middle and high income families who get most of  the $600 million, while low income families are impoverished.

In every case, as the attached table demonstrates, families with  more than one child are forced further into poverty in a way  which a civilised and affluent society should find intolerable.

For instance, a worker with five children and one income only  of $140 a week, $10 above the minimum wage, will be $4l.80 a week  below the 1  austere1  poverty line of Professor Henderson, $3Â·34  worse than the December figure. A worker with three children

and only one income of $30 a week above the minimum wage, who  was previously 43ÃÂ above the poverty line, will now be $1.20  below it.

A single parent on pension with five children will be $34.35 a week  below the poverty line, i.e. $4.05 worse off than six months earlier.

Senator Guilfoyle is looking for a new poverty line, less  embarrassing to the Government, but it will not be acceptable  unless it considered and set by a body totally independent of  Government.

VICTIMISATION OF THE UNEMPLOYED IN COUNTRY AREAS

New work test provisions are making life a nightmare for many  country persons unable to find work.

In last month's 1  Social Security Bulletin' we drew attention to  the summary termination of unemployment benefit to aboriginals  in Pingelly who could not produce evidence that they had  travelled the long distances to farms in the area, looking for  non-existent work, and were then thrown into gaol because they

could not pay their debts.

We have now had a complaint from a 59 year old single -unemployed  man in Western Australia whose letter from Social Security gave  as the reason for withholding his $51Â·^5 a week unemployment  benefit the fact that hp had not lodged his income statement  personally, though he lives 25 km from the nearest office and

there is no public transport.

Personal lodgement of income statements was among tougher work  test provisions announced by Mr Street in March 1976. At that  time Senator Guilfoyle assured the Senate that:

"those people who live in remote areas or in areas where  transport is unavailable will not be required to attend  personally with their fortnightly statements".

It is clear that instructions, waiving the requirement for  personal lodgement of statements, should be going out to all  non-metropolitan C.E.S. and Social Security offices.

People in country areas looking for work where there is little  or no public transport and existing on the non-indexed payment  of $51.45 a week should not be penalised if they cannot produce  names of enough employers or get to the office to lodge income

statements. Their unemployment benefit is way below the poverty  line, and the Government gives them no travel assistance to  look for the jobs which will ensure they are not cut off benefit.

In January there were 185,000 unemployed registered for work  in non-metropolitan areas. If the Government can't provide  the conditions for work and won't provide travel assistance,  it has no right to apply work test instructions in such a  heavy-handed way, removing the only income available to an  unemployed job-seeker.

LABOR'S JOB OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM

With the venom of a guilty m a n ,  the Minister for Employment and  Youth Affairs, Mr Viner, has atteked the job opportunities program  announced on 23 March by Bill Hayden and Mick Young.

The Labor program aims to create new work opportunities, reduce  youth unemployment, provide work for the most disadvantaged and  increase training opportunities, with 100,000 new full time jobs  and training positions in the first operating year.

The main components are: .

4 .

1. Establishment of an Australian Manpower Office which,;*,  will directly fund employment creation programs;  encourage employment in the private sector; take over  Commonwealth training and apprenticeship schemes;   build a data collection for manpower planning; and

take responsibility for the Commonwealth Employment  Service. It will operate the following programs -2. A Community Service Corps will create 50,000 jobs at  junior level on minimum award pay to people between the

ages of 16 and 24 who have been registered with the C.E.S.  for over three months.

3. A WORK program for 20,000 unemployed adults with dependants,  also at appropriate award rates, with those who have been  longest unemployed having priority.

Both these programs will undertake projects submitted by  local government and community organisations.

4. Subsidised employment in the private sector with a basic  subsidy of 30% of wage costs for six months where new  jobs are created, or where an employee has been out of  work for three months of the past year, with an extra

loading for disadvantaged workers and disadvantaged areas. For small businesses the subsidy would be payable for  eight inonths. It is expected that 30,000 people would be  employed in the first year.

5. Current apprenticeship intakes will be boosted, with a more  efficient pattern of instruction and a more regular intake. The NEAT program will be re-cast and CYSS guidelines will be  reviewed to ensure maximum effectiveness and compatibility  with other programs.

Mr Viner has called the Labor proposals a Â®  re-hash1  and  1  discredited *. He claimed that the job opportunities program  would be 'at the expense of responsible economic management1,   and that Labor 'totally ignores the turn around in economic

performance and employment which has emerged over the last 15 monthsÂ®.

Let us look at the Fraser Government's economic performance as  it affects the unemployed.

Since Labor was forced from office in November 1975 the numbers  of unemployed registered with the CES has risen 74% - from 265,600  to 462,800.

The number on unemployment benefit, the tests for which are now  painfully stringent,  have risen by 81%, from 184,000 to 334,500.

The number of registered jobless for each unfilled vacancy has  risen from 9Â·5 to 22, and 123*000  persons have been on benefit  for. six months or longer.

From November. 1975 to November 1979 only 1,000 additional jobs  were added to the labour force in the private sector.

Only 98*000 additional jobs have been found, yet 197*200 more  are registered with the C.E.S. since the Fraser Government came to office.

5 .

Hundreds of thousands more are among the ’hidden unemployed'  either as discouraged workers, unemployed spouses, or people  who do not register with the C.E.S. because of the hopelessness  of the job market.

The Government is quite complacent about its failures to  ameliorate the situation of the unemployed.

Its latest ill-founded and virulent attack on Labor's proposals  to give 100,000 people work and training experience shows how  carelessly it is prepared to damage the future chances and  dignity of unemployed people of all ages who have become  disheartened and demoralised.

LONE PARENTS

There has been no apparent progress in the problems of uniform  treatment of lone parents.

As reported in the December 'Social Security Bulletin', the  Victorian Government pushed the Commonwealth into taking full  responsibility for their income payments from 1 January 1980.  Since then lone parents in Victoria have been applying for

special benefit with all its difficulties.

The time has come for the Commonwealth to pay all lone parent  benefits. People bringing up children alone should not be  treated differently according to which State they live in. The Labor Party believes that need should be the basis of

the lone parents pension or benefit,  and that different types  of lone parents payments are discriminatory and anomalous. Since 1973 we have been working towards a single lone parents  pension, and it should be introduced now, removing the provision

that the States should pay half for the first six months.

Some States make the fair comment that in the first difficult  months single mothers and deserted wives need considerable help  from State housing and welfare departments, and State income  support payments are appropriate at that time.

Despite the validity of that claim, there is a need to ensure  that all Commonwealth citizens should be treated equally in  receiving income support which should provide -(a) a lone parents pension based on need

(b) the same income test applying to other pensions

(c) access to health care

(d) child care facilities

(e) reform of taxation laws to increase the sole  parents rebate.

THE UNKNOWN APPEALS SYSTEM

The two Ministers for Sloppy Administration, the Attorney-  General and the Minister for Social Security, announced on  21 March that a new system would be introduced on 1 April  so that social service claimants turned down by the Director-  General of Social Services could then appeal to the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

I cannot tell whether anyone anywhere knows how this will  work, but it is evident that neither of the Ministers  concerned has a clue. .

Members of the Social Security Appeals Tribunals who learned  of the change only this week are equally in the dark about  how the system will operate.

The history goes back at least three years, when the then  Attorney-General, said that social service appeals would come  under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal umbrella as soon as  they got around to doing something about it.

The Law Council of Australia had misgivings about appeals which  would be heard in a legal rather than a social context, believing  many appellants would find the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  excessively intimidating. They advocated other ways of dealing  with appeals from the Director-General's veto.

It has taken the Attorney-General and the Minister for Social  Security three years to ignore these recommendations and take  the small step of adding an appeal to the Administrative Appeals  Tribunal to the present procedures.

I welcome anything that removes the given discretion of the  Director-General, Mr Lanigan, in overturning recommendations  made in the claimant's favour.

I merely find it incredible that less than a week before the  new system is to begin operations the Attorney-General is  merely:

"considering the appointment of additional members of the  panel so that people will be present who will have some  special qualifications in the social services area. They  will then sit on the hearings of these appeals. The matter  has not yet been finalised. However, it is intended that

they should be appointed before any work is before the  Tribunal." (Hansard 25 March 1980)

Senator Durack's bland and ignorant statement shows he is  quite unaware that the result of appeals from people entirely  dependent on social services can be a matter of the viability  of the family, debt and hunger.

Senator Guilfoyle was no better prepared to explain its workings,   and it does not appear from her answer in the Senate that she  understands even the procedures under the present appeals system.

7 .

In my question I raised *  the refusal to pay unemployment  benefits during an appeal'. Her reply was:

"In the case of the unemployment benefit where it is  regarded as a benefit which requires a claim on such a  short term basis as once a fortnight, a new claim can  be made whilst an appeal is pending".

She seems not to know that in most unemployment benefit refusals  or terminations the persons are judged to have failed the work  test. Applicants during an appeal can file forms until they  are blue in the face, but the application would be thrown out  every time on the original grounds,  however dubious, and the  unemployed would have no income in that time.

Moreover, in the Minute of the Department of Employment and  Youth Affairs dated 7 September 1979Â» Section 31 says:

"Where a person lodges another claim for benefit shortly  after failing the work test a period of postponement of  between six and twelve weeks will be applied."

That is, while pensioners and supporting parents have their  entitlement continued, unemployment beneficiaries are expected  to forego hundreds of dollars while appealing for justice.

Senator Guilfoyle and Senator Durack have some serious and  urgent thinking to do about how the new system will work and  how they can best protect appellants from bureaucratic  mishap and injustice.

In particular,  the people Senator Durack refers to as having  1  special qualifications in the social services area1  should be  people sensitive to changes in living patterns; to the  bewilderment of people with poor literacy who cannot understand  departmental regulations; to debt and the fear of debt; to  regional and racial handicaps; and in general, to the poverty  and despair of people taken off social services.

If, as Senator Durack stated last week 1  they should be appointed  before any work is before the Tribunal, he has an obligation to  expedite the appointments and procedures to minimise the  inevitable bank-up of cases, so that the suffering of appellants

is not prolonged.

Senator Durack and Senator Guilfoyle should also give serious  consideration to financing welfare advocates to guide people  who believe they have been wrongly refused pensions and benefits  through the maze of reviews and appeals.

Most claimants lodging appeals need a good listener,  a good  adviser and someone they can trust to help them with written  and verbal explanations who can if necessary speak up on their  behalf. This is far more important than help with legal aid,

for legal advisers will be relevant only in a minority of cases.
