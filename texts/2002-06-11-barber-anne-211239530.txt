Women’s Constitutional Convention Thursday June 13, 2002. Bill of Rights discussion paper Anne Barber - Women Into Politics

When I mention the topic of  “Human Rights” or a “Bill of Rights” into conversations, as I frequently do, it is almost possible to see eyes rolling and a mask of polite disinterest drop onto everyone’s faces.  The topic is a big yawn and either not understood or avoided.  It is my firm belief however, that this is not a debate that should be conducted by and only comprehensible to lawyers (on the premise that it concerns the balance of power between the judiciary and the parliament), but should be understood by all Australian citizens.

Background

There are almost as many arguments against a Bill of Rights as there are for it, it is fair to say however that most of the debate does not centre on the legitimacy or the need for human rights and that they should be protected, but how this protection should be afforded.

Indeed, one of the arguments against the introduction of a Bill of Rights is that it would be too difficult to compile a list of those “rights” that a Bill should (rather than could) encompass.  When we consider the detail of what should be included, it becomes a balance of a freedom to do something that is usually interpreted against a diminution of another freedom, eg the right to organise and belong to a trade union has been perceived as a threat to business by some employers, and Aboriginal land rights has caused concerns with pastoralists and mining companies.

The other major argument against a Bill of Rights is that an elected parliament is the most appropriate mechanism to look after the interests of citizens and this structure has in fact, limited human rights abuses.  A sort of ‘trust me, I’m a politician’!!!!

What are Human Rights?

The ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) describes different tiers - or “generations” of rights:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ‘civil and political rights’ - such as rights to life, liberty, free speech, movement, political thought and religious practice, a fair trial, privacy, to found a family and to vote;

2

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ‘economic, social and cultural rights’ - such as rights to adequate food and water, health care, education, a clean environment, to respect for cultural practices, and to welfare assistance; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ humanitarian rights - that is the rights of those who are involved in, or affected by,

armed conflict, such as the treatment of prisoners of war, of the wounded or sick or shipwrecked, of civilians, and of women and children in particular; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ various categories of rights as defined by the nature of the holders - such as the rights of workers, women, children, minority groups, refugees, indigenous peoples

and people with a disability.

Similar in some respects to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, that as the most basic needs are satisfied then the next level need becomes a motivator.  In the case of rights, then civil and political rights are the most basic rights, which is followed by economic, social and cultural rights once the basic rights have been gained.

Protection of human rights in other countries:

USA - Bill of Rights (1870).  Cannot be altered, subject to interpretation, rights expressed in negative terms (what will not happen)

Canada - Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) renamed from a Bill of Rights (1960). Developed after extensive consultations, expresses rights in positive terms and based on the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and the European Charter of Human Rights.  Specific mention of multi-cultural society and bi-lingual population.

New Zealand - Bill of Rights (1990).  Rights protected are primarily civil and political, does not specifically mention Maori people.

South Africa - Bill of Rights (1996).  Parliament cannot override.  Covers social and economic rights

UK - Human Rights Act (1998).  Previous law was Bill of Rights 1689 delineating boundaries between parliament and the sovereign.  Pressure to introduce was because of inclusion in the European Union.  Economic, social and cultural rights are not covered.

Australian protection of human rights

Australia has introduced Federal legislation for the protection of human rights which draws upon principles of the ICCPR:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Racial Discrimination Act 1974 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Family Law Act 1975 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Freedom of Information Act 1982 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Privacy Act 1988 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Disability Discrimination Act 1992 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Evidence Act 1995

In 1981 a Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills was established, following an inquiry of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee in 1978, to report on bills and Acts introduced into the Senate whether they “trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties”

3

The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 details the powers and functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) as the Commonwealth agency responsible for monitoring and promoting human rights protection. The Commission also has responsibilities under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.

There have been attempts to introduce of a Bill of Rights in Australia at a Federal level:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1973 Attorney General Lionel Murphy introduced a Human Rights Bill based on the ICCPR.  Opposed by the States. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1984 reconsidered by Attorney General Gareth Evans and then withdrawn. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1985 revised by Attorney General Lionel Bowen.  Passed through House of Reps but

lapsed in the Senate Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1987 Constitutional Commission recommended inserting a Bill of Rights into Chapter VIA of the Constitution  - not adopted, but Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1988 referendum on changes to the Constitution on a number of aspects only gained

33.7% support nationally.

and in the States:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1987 - Victoria.  Recommended that a Declaration of Rights and Freedoms be inserted into the Constitution and to establish a Parliamentary committee to scrutinise all bills.  The Declaration lapsed, and the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee (the SARC) was created in 1992. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1989 - Queensland.  Enquiry recommended the introduction of a state-based Bill

of Rights that covered only civil and political rights.  Not taken up.  Reviewed in 1998 and recommended against its adoption.  1995 set up The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1994 - ACT.  A bill was tabled in 1995 and left to lapse.  I understand that a Bill of Rights is currently being considered. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 2001 - NSW.  The Standing Committee on Law and Justice found that it was not in the public interest for the NSW government to enact a statutory Bill of Rights.  The Committee further recommended that the NSW Parliament establish a Scrutiny of Legislation Committee similar to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee.  In this review, the Committee received 52 submissions in support of a Bill of Rights and 28 submissions and 59 letters opposing it.  It should also be noted that Peter Breen, MLC included a dissenting report stating that 68% of submissions supported the idea of a Bill of Rights.

It is fair to say that the arguments for a Bill of Rights presented in these enquiries has highlighted the shortcomings of current legislation and has been instrumental in the formation of committees for ongoing reviews of proposed legislation.

Trusting politicians / legislatures to do the right thing!!! I don’t think so

Despite all of the comments about scrutinising committees and current legislation being sufficient protection of human rights, we are still at the mercy of various political parties and their particular beliefs.  We vote for this person or that party on the basis of what they tell us they will do for us - introduce a GST, have a vision for Australia, etc. but citizens rely on others that understand the implication of these plans to carry out research and expose its potential impact on human rights or on our way of life.

Despite the comments by various investigating bodies about the difficulties of introducing legislation for a Bill of Rights, I believe it is essential that we agree standards against which we could measure the impact of any new legislation.  At the moment we only have a vague

4

notion of what we envisage the Australian human rights to be.   Some of these “rights” are not based on principles, but on custom and practice, such as “a fair go”.

In their submission to the NSW enquiry, the Law Society of New South Wales argued that “under our current system, ‘rights’ are what are left over after legislation and regulation have finished … our whole system at the moment is negative rather than positive”.

So, can we trust politicians?  Let me give some examples of why we should not:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Herstory of women;  right to divorce, inheritance rights, right to education, right to vote, etc.  Feminism has done more to change of face of human rights in the last century than any other political thought. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Impact of “Terra nulius”  on the aboriginal way of life. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Threat to provision of services in NSW due to insurance companies refusing cover of

activities, such as FPA Health and midwives, yet professional indemnity extended to private medical practitioners. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Refusing IVF for single women is not permitted by the Sexual Discrimination Act -and changes to the Act are threatened Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Politicians influenced by religion (or is that cultural influence?) - continue to

introduce bills to restrict a woman’s right to choose Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Refugees pronounced guilty (until proven innocent) and locked away in camps Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Despite medical evidence on the harm of smoking, smoking tobacco is legal whilst smoking marihuana is not. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Legislation introduced that meets the whim of politicians, eg Federal Attorney

General Daryl Williams introducing the “ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill” contrasted to the fact that the optional protocol CEDAW has not yet been ratified which would allow women who cannot get justice in their own country to appeal to the UN. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Euthanasia debate.  Since legislation was overturned in the Northern Territory, the

medical profession recently have reviewed the actions that they can take ethically without bringing them into contravention of their own rules and the law.  Citizens cannot be assisted to suicide and anyone that does so will be charged.  We only have recourse to a “Living Will” to spell out our wishes. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ W.A. introduced “three strikes and you are in” (into gaol) without regard to individual

circumstances or the magnitude of the crime.

Giving support to our call for a review of Australia’s human rights protection is this statement from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s (HREOC) website:

“Australia has been urged by international human rights monitors to rethink the implementation of human rights in Australia.   Many Australians have come to the same conclusion.

“Former Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason, for example, wrote in 1997:

Australia's adoption of a Bill of Rights would bring Australia in from the cold, so to speak, and make directly applicable the human rights jurisprudence which has developed internationally and elsewhere. That is an important consideration in that our isolation from that jurisprudence means that we do not have what is a vital component of other constitutional and legal systems, a component which has a significant impact on culture and thought, and is an important ingredient in the emerging world order that is reducing the effective choices open to the nation state.”

Another body that has a focus on human rights is the Human Rights Council of Australia. The Human Rights Council of Australia Inc, was established in 1978, and is a private non-government organization with the goal of promoting understanding of and respect for human

5

rights for all persons without discrimination through adherence to the International Bill of Rights, and other human rights instruments, internationally and within Australia.

They also have expressed a concern about human rights in Australia:

“During 1997 and 1998 the Human Rights Council of Australia became increasingly concerned about divisions in Australian society. The Council and its members, through their work in many parts of Australia and through the research and analysis they had access to, became convinced that these divisions were growing. The divisions were usually typified as being between city and country, haves and have-nots, elites and battlers, indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The Council saw a need for a national campaign to strengthen key Australian values of respect, tolerance, diversity and a fair go as a timely and strategic response to these divisions.”  Quote from the website of the Human Rights Council of Australia.

Yet despite this statement, there is also a comment on the website that:

“Australia has no Bill of Rights entrenched in any of its Commonwealth or State Constitutions. However, Australia has one of the best human rights records in the world.  Perhaps the innate national characteristics of tolerance and a `fair-go' are of more importance than black letter law”.  Quote from the website of the Human Rights Council of Australia.

Their complacency must be surely challenged by the legislation before the Parliament concerning ASIO and mandatory detention and will surely force them to think again.

A mechanism that could avoid some of the difficulties of legislation (though what weight it would carry has not been detailed), is the introduction of an ‘Australian Compact’.  This was suggested in the Australian Citizenship Council’s report “Australian Citizenship for a New Century” , and listed the principal ideas that most people would accept as strong in our Australian liberal-democracy.

This concept was taken further in a booklet by Donald Horne in 2002 which was funded and produced by the NSW Centenary of Federation Committee, “An Australian Compact?  What are the Core Values that all Australians might Respect?”   The booklet aims to generate discussion about civic values that Australians would share.

The elements of the Compact are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To maintain the rule of law Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To strengthen Australia as a representative liberal democracy based on universal adult suffrage and on freedom of opinion Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To maintain the ideal of the equality under the law of all Australians Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To uphold the ideal of Australia as a tolerant and fair society Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To recognise and celebrate Australia as an inclusive society of multi-national, multi-

ethnic and multi-racial origin Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To continue to develop Australia as a society devoted to the wellbeing of its people Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To respect and care for the land we share Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To value the unique status of the Indigenous peoples.

This is a process that avoids the difficulties of legislation, but will it protect women?

Women Into Politics

Has taken the position, as outlined in “A Women’s Charter for Political Reform 2001”  (p23-25) that:

5.1 The Australian Government should legislate a Bill of Rights which:

5.1.1 has overriding powers to encompass rights that have been enunciated in various UN instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 5.1.2 includes an equality right for women; 5.1.3 explicitly protects substantive equality rather than formal equality; 5.1.4 recognises rights in relation to sexual orientation; 5.1.5 contains provisions for special measures to address inequality in society; 5.1.6 operates in the private as well as the public sphere.

5.2 The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission should be empowered to oversee the implementation, and to enforce penalties for breaches, of the legislation, and should be adequately funded to facilitate human rights education and to provide for free access to the courts for victims of breaches of their human rights.

The Women’s Constitutional Convention in 1999 (see www.womensconv.dynamite.com.au) recommended a constitutional Bill of Rights or, failing that, a legislated Bill of Rights, which would guarantee the rights of women and indigenous peoples;  which would retain current gains and fulfil Australia’s commitments under various UN conventions.

In the WIP The Charter for Political Reform the point is also made that:

“In light of Australia’s record in rejecting referendums, a legislated Bill of Rights appears to be the only immediate option.”

Arguments in favour of a Bill of Rights

Report 17 of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice “A NSW Bill of Rights” October 2001 distilled the arguments in favour of a Bill of Rights as:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The educative value of a Bill of Rights in political debates, thereby developing greater understanding of human rights within the community Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The inadequate protections of human rights for the community, due to gaps in current legislation and the uncertainty of the common law Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The inadequate protection of minorities in society in the absence of a Bill Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The international isolation of the development of domestic law in the absence of a Bill

of Rights Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Bill of Rights can facilitate a constructive dialogue between the Judiciary and the Parliament.

For details of the arguments visit the website www.parliament.nsw.gov.au.

So, where to from here?

We need to become more aware of how our human rights can be infringed and be reminded that women’s rights are human rights.  I don’t mean the really obvious attempts to curtail

7

human rights, such as Attorney General Daryl Williams Anti-terrorist legislation that has been substantially amended with bi-partisan support (but should be defeated), but infringement that can occur through means such as government funding of particular organizations and groups.

At a Bill of Rights forum last week organised by “A Just Republic”, one of the speakers, Dorothy McRae-McMahon, said that she was coming around to thinking that the provision of non-secular education could be a human rights issue.   Flowing from this is a concern about government funding for private schools (usually religious).  Could attendance at non-secular schools increase intolerance?   Could non-secular education foster groups who support a particular culture or belief (eg opposed to women’s right to choose)?  Are we being complacent about the continuation of our human rights in this environment?  This is just one example of how the silent erosion of human rights may be occurring.

I would like to encourage all women to either become involved or maintain their involvement in the debate about human rights.  You can do this by:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ being involved in movements that are promoting a Bill of Rights, Ã¢ÂÂ¢ making submissions to enquiries (such as the current enquiry in the ACT) Ã¢ÂÂ¢ lobbying individual politicians and political parties, providing examples of where human rights are being eroded Ã¢ÂÂ¢ lobbying for economic, social and cultural rights and not just civil and political rights. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ not being one of the silent majority

Women Into Politics will continue to explore the issue of a legislated Bill of Rights with women.  Women must be participants in the current debate or again left to fight after the event.
