TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - MTR1377 STEVE VIZARD MORNING SHOW

SUBJECT:  FUTURE FUND; IMMIGRATION.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



VIZARD: The Minister responsible is Penny Wong, she’s on the line now. Penny, thanks for  your time again.

WONG: No worries, good to be with you.

VIZARD: Penny, you put out a release saying the Government’s not making any  withdrawals of any sort from the Future Fund, of the sort that were talked about in The  Australian today. Can you just run us through what is the case with this story?

WONG: Quite simply, what has been reported as a withdrawal of funds from the Future  Fund is simply not correct - and nor are Senator Cormann’s accusations. What is occurring  is that the Future Fund is making a change to the types of assets it holds, and that the fact  of that change is reflected in the Budget papers. They are selling what are called non  financial assets, so they are things like land, plant and equipment, and so forth. When that  sale occurs, that is reflected in the budget figures.

But I want to emphasise this: any funds from any sale remain with the Future Fund. Any  funds from any sale remain with the Future Fund.

VIZARD: Penny, the reason that this gets some momentum at all is because of its report on  the front of The Australian - and some remarks that were made by a spokeswoman - a  spokeswoman for you - but that echoes something that was made to a parliamentary  committee. Can I just replay something Barnaby Joyce said just a couple of moments ago  to me?

[Start recording]

BARNABYJOYCE: A question was asked of a gentleman by the name of Mr Tune in the  Senate Finance and Public Administration legislative committee estimates. They asked him  where are these non financial assets that you’re going to sell, that are going to be part of

bringing the budget back into surplus. His answer came back, the disposal of Defence  properties - there’s one. The disposal of housing and land owned by Defence Housing  Australia, and the expected sale of assets from the Future Fund. So, when these stories  come out, they’re not just made up, Penny Wong, they actually, basically, come from  information from your own department.

[End recording]

VIZARD: Is that wrong?

WONG: It is in this sense: the monies stay with the Future Fund. So what we are seeing is  the Future Fund choosing to change the assets it has. Under the legislation, no withdrawals  from the Fund can be made until 2020, unless there are sufficient funds to cover the  liabilities earlier. We are not changing the legislation -

VIZARD: But that’s not what Mr Tune said.

WONG: Hang on. We are not changing the legislation. All we are doing, in the Budget  papers, is reflecting a decision that the Future Fund has made. And I again will say this: the  Future Fund will continue to hold any cash from any sale it makes. If it then chooses to  invest that cash into other assets, it will continue to hold that. So with respect Steve -

VIZARD: So Mr Tune got it wrong?

WONG: No, he hasn’t got it wrong. Barnaby Joyce has got it wrong, as has Senator  Cormann. So, with respect, I don’t think playing Barnaby Joyce on the radio to make an  assertion about finances of the nation is a very strong case.

VIZARD: Do you say Mr Tune didn’t make that written response to the parliamentary  committee?

WONG: What I am saying is that the Budget papers under Peter Costello, and under this  Government, do reflect the inclusion of non financial assets in the Budget papers, and we  have done the same thing. But the suggestion that we are somehow withdrawing money  out of the Future Fund for the purposes of spending it is simply incorrect.

VIZARD: What’ll happen to Mr Tune?

WONG: (laughs) Mr Tune is a very good public servant, I work with him very closely and  have on a number of things, including the Federal Budget.

VIZARD: Can I ask you, Penny - thanks for clarifying that - there’s no sense of mischief  here. I think it’s a clear division between what you’re now saying and what was understood  to have been said by a public servant.

WONG: No, Steve, I don’t accept that.

VIZARD: OK.

WONG: I don’t accept that. I think there’s a difference between what some people are  trying to spin up, and trying to spin the Australian people, and what I am saying, which is  being very clear about what is reported in the Budget papers. And can I just say this -

VIZARD: Yep.

WONG: We have an Opposition that has no runs on the board when it comes to fiscal  policy, and to managing the budget. They’ve got a shadow finance minister in Andrew Robb  who says there’s a $70 billion black hole. Mr Abbott says there isn’t a $70 billion black hole,  contradicting his own economic team. And this is the Opposition that had an $11 billion  black hole in their election costings which they’ve only added to. So, let’s have a little bit of  reality about the credentials of some of the people making these criticisms.

VIZARD: Penny, you’ve just come out of, I imagine, caucus, it’s just been meeting about  the asylum seeker policy.

WONG: Yes.

VIZARD:  I know this is a divided issue, a contentious issue - where are you up to? You’ve  got those advocating onshore processing, those advocating offshore processing. Where is  it sitting at the moment?

WONG: This is a difficult issue, obviously the High Court decision did alter the way in which  most people understood the law. We’ve had a long discussion today, which you’re aware of  - actually, that was why I wasn’t able to come on your program earlier, when you first  asked. But, I understand that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration will be  making a public statement shortly, so I probably should leave it to them, Steve.

VIZARD: Alright, we look forward to hearing that. Penny Wong, thanks for your time, and  good to talk to you again.

WONG: Good to be with you. Thank you.
