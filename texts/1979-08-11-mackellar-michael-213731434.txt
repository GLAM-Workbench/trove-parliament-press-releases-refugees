INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST .ACT ON REFUGEES

11 August 1979 122/79

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

.the Hon.  M.J.R, MacKellar said today that the Indo-Chinese

refugee outflow had demonstrated major deficiencies in. the Â·

system of instruments and machinery to ensure that human .

rights were not simply affirmed but were accepted by

governments.

Recent events in Indo- China suggested the need

for the international community to adopt a gradual set of

obligations covering survival,  sanctuary, protection,

resettlement and civil rights for refugees,  Mr MacKellar told

a United Nations Association conference in Brisbane.

Covenants on civil and political rights and on

economic, social and cultural rights were no more than

affirmations and imposed no obligations whatsoever unless

countries had ratified or acceded to them, Mr MacKellar said.

Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos, for example, were not

parties to any such covenants or international instruments,

Yet there was no doubt that the human rights of a substantial

proportion of the peoples of Vietnam had not been guaranteed or

protected.  -

"Categories of people have been denied civil rights

accepted by the international community through international

instruments adopted by the United Nations and its agencies,"

Mr MacKeliar said.

"Some groups of people are prevented from engaging in

employment, their children are prevented from obtaining education,

they have been required to engage in re-education seminars or

go to new economic zones and others have had their property

expropriated"Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·

'Countries prepared to indulge in such callous and

irresponsible behaviour could use refugee outflows as a

destabilising influence on other countries or regions'-

Mr MacKellar said.

Such a policy had enormous economic,  social and

political effects on other countries. Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  It was an attitude that was questioned at the recent

Geneva conference on Indo-Chinese refugeesÃ¢ÂÂ

"Several governments were beginning to ask whether the

international community could afford to tolerate action by a

government which was contrary to the maintenance of human

rights and responsible behaviour on which membership of the ,

United Nations is based,” Mr MacKellar said.

And while countries bound by international convenants

and instruments dealing with refugees had continuing obligations

to give protection the country causing the exodus had no

obligation to introduce conditions of human rights so that

departure was no longer necessary, .

Mr MacKellar said this was a. grave deficiency in

the present array of international instruments and mechanisms

that dealt with refugee situations.

He also doubted that more countries in the South East

Asian region would ratify such instruments or conventions because

of the open-ended nature of the commitment.  .
