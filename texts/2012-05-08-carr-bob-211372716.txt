2012-13 INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BUDGET

Australia’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) will increase to $5.2 billion in  2012-13 - an increase of $2 billion, or 60 per cent more, since the election of the  Labor Government in 2007.

Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Carr, said this confirmed Australia could become  the sixth largest aid donor in the OECD by 2015-16.

“The allocation in the 2012-13 Budget to ODA will increase by over $300 million from  2011-12 and maintain ODA at 0.35% of Gross National Income (GNI),” Senator Carr  said.

“In a tight fiscal environment, the Government has decided to defer the achievement  of providing 0.5 per cent of GNI to official development assistance by one year.

“Funding for ODA will continue to grow each year; it will, however, grow at a slightly  slower rate so that 0.5 per cent of GNI is achieved in 2016-17.

“Funding for the important work of Australian non-government organisations (NGOs)  will also continue to increase with the expansion of the AusAID NGO Cooperation  Program to $110 million in 2012/13 and $165 million by 2015/16.

“Consistent with the Government’s aid policy ‘An Effective Aid Program for Australia:  Making a real difference—Delivering real results’, announced in July 2011, the  Gillard Government has now set out a plan which outlines how we will deliver real  results for the poor by 2015-16.

The 2012-13 Budget will implement this plan, and over the next four years the plan  will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  enable 4 million boys and girls to enrol in school and improve the quality of  education for 20 million poor children;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  vaccinate 10 million children and provide access to safe drinking water for  over 8.5 million people;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  provide over 2.3 million poor people with access to financial services; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  provide assistance to an estimated 30 million people in crisis situations.

Returning the budget to surplus and growing the surplus year on year provides  Australia with a fiscal and economic buffer in uncertain global economic times. The  Government has taken the tough, but fiscally responsible, decision to defer providing  0.5 per cent of GNI as aid until 2016-17. This will provide $2.9 billion in savings  across the four-year forward estimates.



The Government remains committed to achieving the Millennium Development  Goals and the aid program will continue to grow in dollar terms.

The 2012-13 Budget implements the Government’s new aid policy and will achieve  widespread results for the world’s poor. This aid spending will emphasise our focus  on our neighbours, with over 70 per cent of Australian aid delivered in the Asia-Pacific region.

New aid initiatives for Asia and the Pacific in the 2012-13 Budget include:



Closing Development Gaps in East Asia  Australian interests are inextricably linked to a stable and prosperous East Asia.

The Gillard Government will increase assistance to the poorest countries of East  Asia, with $208.6 million over four years being invested to improve agricultural  productivity and boost health and education services in Burma, Cambodia, and Laos,  and to improve resilience to floods and other natural disasters in Vietnam.

This assistance will help over 250,000 students to attain a better education and  60,000 farmers to free themselves from poverty.



Overcoming Poverty and Building Stability in the Pacific   The Gillard Government will extend Australia’s efforts to overcome poverty and build  stability in the Pacific by investing $384.5 million over four years for health, higher  education and the particular needs of the micro-states of Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu.

Over the next four years, this assistance will result in vaccinations for 41,000  children, strengthen around 60 higher-education institutions across the region to  deliver high-quality education, and support 4,000 young people across the Pacific to  graduate with recognised qualifications and skills for the workforce.



Continuation of the Pacific Police Development Program   The Gillard Government will invest $97.1 million over four years through the  Australian Federal Police and Attorney General’s Department to assist policing  agencies across the Pacific to improve security in our region. This assistance will  improve policing skills and leadership, implement community policy projects and  communication campaigns, upgrade national police headquarters and academies,  and strengthen legal frameworks.

Extension of the AFP commitment to the United Nations Mission in East Timor  The Gillard Government will provide $3.5 million in 2012-13 to enable the Australian  Federal Police to continue their 50 officer deployment in East Timor as part of the  United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste.

Continuation of Australia’s Aid Program in Afghanistan  The Gillard Government will invest $190.3 million over two years to continue its aid  program in Afghanistan. This funding will put more than 30,000 additional boys and  girls in school and build over 100 kilometres of rural roads to provide farmers with  better access to markets.

This recognises that strengthening the capacity of the Afghan Government, economy  and institutions is essential to ensuring that the gains made to date are not reversed.

Australia will also invest in our global and humanitarian responsibilities:

Strengthening Preparedness and Response to Humanitarian Crises  The Gillard Government will invest $435.6 million over four years to strengthen  developing countries’ preparedness for natural disasters, enhance Australia’s ability  to respond to disasters in our region and internationally, and build our partnerships  with organisations such as the World Food Programme, the International Committee  of the Red Cross, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

Natural disasters have an acute impact in developing countries. A person is 25 times  more likely to die from a disaster in a low-income country, and countries and  communities recovering from disasters and conflict suffer setbacks in economic and  social progress.

This is a critical investment in the stability and prosperity of our region, which has  suffered 85 per cent of global deaths from natural disasters over the last three  decades.



Australia’s Development Partnerships with the United Nations  The Gillard Government will invest $154.3 million over four years to expand  Australia’s engagement with UNICEF, UN Women, the UN Development Program,  World Health Organisation, UN Population Fund and UNAIDS.

Australia’s increased contribution to these organisations will accelerate gains  towards the Millennium Development Goals. For example, in 2010 UNICEF  responded to 290 humanitarian situations in 98 countries and supported an  estimated 573,000 schools in 89 countries.

A recent comprehensive assessment of multilateral organisations (the Australian  Multilateral Assessment) determined that these humanitarian and development  organisations were performing well, and that Australia could have confidence in their  effectiveness.

Australia’s investment will multiply the reach and influence of our aid program,  enhance our standing as a good international citizen, and help these organisations  focus on the needs of poor people in our region.



Development Banks  Consistent with the intent of Australia’s new aid policy ‘An Effective Aid Program for  Australia’, Australia is deepening its engagement with effective multilateral  organisations including the Development Banks.

During 2012-13, Australia will enhance its role in the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  - one of our most important partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and rated in the top  tier of multilateral organisations under the Australian Multilateral Assessment.

Australia’s pledge in March this year to the ADB positions us to become the second  largest donor to this organisation, and will have far reaching results across Asia and  the Pacific, including benefitting 1 million students through school improvement  programs, and supporting 450,000 households to become connected to water  supply.

The Gillard Government will also pursue membership of the African Development  Bank, signalling Australia’s commitment as a long term development partner to  Africa, and of the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development to reduce  rural poverty and hunger.
