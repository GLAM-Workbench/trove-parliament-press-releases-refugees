GREENS IMPROVE PROSPECTS FOR KOSOVAR REFUGEES

Â

Greens (WA) Senator Dee Margetts was successful in having an amendment 
agreed to by all parties when the Migrat ion Legislation Amendment 
(Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999 was passed in the Senate today.

Â

In the event that Australia temporarily accepts Kosovar 
refugees, the Greens (WA) amendment will improve the transparency and 
principles by which the decision to return the refugees will occur.

Â

“I appreciate having received the support of all 
parties for this important change to the legislation. At least some 
reference is now made in the legislation to international standards 
as laid down by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees”, 
Senator Margetts said.

Â

“I am disappointed that a second amendment was not 
successful. This would have made it possible for individuals to seek 
to stay permanently based on a consideration of their individual circumstances.

Â

“It needs to be recognised that for compelling reasons 
certain individuals may not wish to return to Kosovo, even if stable 
conditions have returned to the region.

Â

“I trust that the Minister will acknowledge the 
validity of individual circumstances when it comes time to decide on 
their return”, Senator Margetts concluded.
