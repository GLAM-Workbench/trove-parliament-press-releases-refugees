SHERGOLD REVIEW MUST BE RELEASED



The Morrison Government must release its secret report into refugee settlement in

Australia.



Reports in today’s Herald Sun confirm that the Minister for Immigration, David

Coleman received the report in February this year and has done absolutely nothing

with it.



What has the Morrison Government got to hide? Is this yet another example of

Scott Morrison manipulating the truth?



Mr Morrison cannot keep this report that taxpayers paid for a secret any longer.

This is an important report that aims to improve the integration, employment and

settlement outcomes of refugees in this country. The Australian public have a right

to see it.



According to today’s report the review by respected former bureaucrat Peter

Shergold is critical of the Morrison Government’s handling of refugee settlement

services.





It is believed that the report recommends that settlement services be tailored to

individual refugees and their families, and to bring together services in central

locations.



Refugees have too often lived incredibly painful and dangerous lives, and when

they settle in Australia we should be doing everything we can to help people get

the support they need, find work and integrate into the community.



It follows a rejected Freedom of Information Request by Labor for the Shergold

review last month.



Failing to release this report is treating the public with contempt, as well as letting

down refugees and our communities.
