SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR

HOME AFFAIRS MINISTERS STUMP UP WITH NO ANSWERS

Home Affairs Ministers have been caught out ducking and weaving simple questions  about their portfolios following consideration-in-detail of the Appropriations Bill in  Parliament.

Questions about the future of visa processing services, parent visas, citizenship delays,  the creation of Home Affairs and Australian Border Force vessels were put to Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton and Minister for Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs Alan Tudge by Labor’s Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border  Protection Shayne Neumann.

Minister Alan Tudge had no answers to any of Labor’s questions about planned reform of  visa processing services which has been described by concerned frontline visa  processing workers as the privatisation of visa services.

The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has been charged with visa  operations and visa reform, but couldn’t or wouldn’t answer basic questions about delays  in creating the conservatives long promised new temporary parent visa or blowouts in  citizenship processing times.

This poor performance in the Federation Chamber, follows confirmation in Home Affairs  Senate Estimates that:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Migration is responsible for more than 50% of the ‘million new jobs’ the Turnbull  Government claims it has created over the last five years;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Peter Dutton will now spend $7 million of tax payers money reviewing his own  mega department;  Ã¯ÂÂ· It will cost $3 million to repair the Australian Border Force’s Roebuck Bay Bay

Class vessel after its hull was torn off when it struck the Great Barrier Reef;  Ã¯ÂÂ· ABF’s Fast Response Boat Buri Buri has scraped a reef following navigation  equipment issues on this new vessel;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Despite all the Minister’s bluster, there are no plans to offer special attention to

visa applications by South African farmers;  Ã¯ÂÂ· After creating panic by threatening to cut off Status Resolution Support Service  payments for more than 12,000 people, the department still doesn’t know how

many people will be impacted by Minister Dutton’s decision to change the eligibility  criteria; and  Ã¯ÂÂ· Refugees in Manus Island and Nauru are no longer waiting for the Turnbull  Government and have taken third country resettlement into their own hands, with

three refugees arranging their own resettlement in Canada and another ten other  refugees actively pursuing resettlement in other countries.

Home Affairs Senate Estimates confirmed what we’ve known all along, as Minister for  Home Affairs responsible for immigration; Peter Dutton is a tick and flick Minister  incapable of managing his own department.
