Government and Colston condemn Asylum Seekers

Democrat Disallowance Defeated

Â

An attempt by the Democrats to remove a Government regulation, wh ich 
prevents people who are appealing for refugee status from working while 
their cases are before the courts or the Minister, was defeated today 
by the votes of the Government and Senator Colston.

Â

A motion by Senator Andrew 
Bartlett, Democrat spokesperson for Immigration, to disallow the regulation, 
had been supported by numerous community and charity organisations who 
work with asylum seekers.

Â

“This regulation is 
creating third world conditions in a first world country for a small 
group of people and in some cases, their families,” said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“The regulation, in 
force since 1 July 1998, has caused serious hardship to asylum seekers 
and would-be immigrants and also prevented them from accessing Medicare.

Â

“For the Immigration 
Minister to remove people’s right to work and support themselves while 
they seek recognition as refugees, is an extraordinary move. For Senator 
Colston to support it, is extremely disappointing.

Â

“The enforcement of 
the regulation is tantamount to trying to starve would-be refugees out 
of the country while a proper legal appeal is under way. It is not just 
a breach of human rights, it is inhuman,” he said.

Â

“The same Government 
which is making it more difficult, or impossible, for immigrants to 
access government income support is also preventing intending migrants 
from supporting themselves by working.

Â

“Most refugees and 
migrants desperately want to pay their own way, to build new lives and 
to contribute to their new country.

Â

“Despite the result 
of this vote, we will continue to seek the support of other parties 
and independent Senators to try and create more humane conditions for 
asylum seekers,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
