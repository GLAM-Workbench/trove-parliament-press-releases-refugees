PORTUGUESE TIMOR

Australia is pursuing Several vigorous initiatives  to restore peace in Portuguese Timor,  the Minister for  Foreign Affairs,  the Hon. Andrew Peacock, announced today.

Mr Peacock said that in Jakarta on 10 December  the Australian Ambassador, Mr Woolcott, had called ori the  Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Adam Malik, to inform him  of the Australian Government's views on the problem of  Portuguese Timor. .

The Ambassador had told Mr Malik that the Australian  Government was strongly opposed to the use of force in  Timor and that force was not the appropriate way to solve  the problems of the territory. .

On instructions, Mr Woolcott had also raised  with Mr Malik the question of humanitarian assistance to  Portuguese Timor, as Mr Peacock had foreshadowed inÂ·his  statement of 8 December. The Indonesian Foreign Minister  .  was informed that Australia was eager to resume humanitarian  ,  aid and that Australia hoped that the International Red

Cross operations would start again as soon as possible.

'  Mr Malik's response was encouraging and Mr Peacock

said that the Australian authorities "Would be following  j ;  the question up with Indonesia. The Government's hope was  I that Australian aid would continue to be provided through  j the ICRC. Mr Peacock said tha,t there was clearly an  / ' Ã¢ÂÂ   urgent need for aid activities in Portuguese Timor to

.  resume. '

He repeated that the Government would adopt a"' *   generous approach to the- problem of refugees from Portuguese  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Timor, should it arise. This would accord with the  attitude traditionally adopted by Liberal-National Country

Party governments. -

Mr Peacock also ^referred to the active role which  .  the Australian delegation was playing in the United Nations  Fourth (Decolonization) Committee,  where the situation in  Portuguese Timor has been under review for the last ten

days. .

He recalled in this regard that Australia, along  with eight other .countries of our region, had been  co-sponsoring a resolution in the Fourth Committee last  week which the Government had hoped would be a positive

contribution in the search for .a peaceful settlement  in Portuguese Timor. In the event, the resolution could  not be brought to the vote mainly because of protracted  discussion of other items and the efforts of a number  of other delegations of countries outside the region to  press for amendments. .

Mr Peacock said that the Australian Government  had .much regretted this development. The regional text  has been overtaken by events of the weekend. There were  now two new draft resolutions before the Committee, one of  which reflected the views of states which are critical

of Indonesia and another draft co-sponsored by a group  of Asian states, which does not seek to apportion blame.

Mr Peacock noted, however,  that the object .of  both resolutions would be to bring about a restoration of  conditions in Portuguese Timor which would allow the  withdrawal of Indonesian forces and permit the process  of self-determination to resume. Discussion of the two

draft resolutions would continue -tomorrow.'

Meanwhile, outside the Fourth Committee, -Ã¢ÂÂ  j consultations have begun among members of the Security  Council concerning Portugal1s request for a Security  i  Council meeting to discuss the Timor issue. "

Ã¢ÂÂ  ? ;  The Australian request to appear before the

4 Security Council had been lodged with the United Kingdom,  which occupies the Presidency of the Security Council  '  this month. The Minister said that in its approach to Ã¢ÂÂ  the Security Council Australia would be urging on the ^

Council the need to move quickly to bring about United  Nations involvement in the problem of Portuguese Timor  as soon as possible. .

While Australia held no fixed views on what form this involvement might take, the Government felt  that the easiest and quickest course would be to despatch  a representative of the Secretary-General to the '   territory to report back on conditions there and to  make recommendations for further action by the Security

Council , he said.

urging that the Council provide for an immediate end to  hostilities and the establishment of conditions for a  v/ithdrawal of Indonesian forces and a resumption of the  process of self-determination, with appropriate United
