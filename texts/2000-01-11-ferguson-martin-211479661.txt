ANDERSON MUST REJECT SENATOR LIGHTFOOT’S

HYSTERICAL RACE COMMENTS

Â

Â

Acting Prim e Minister, John Anderson, must immediately condemn 
the bigoted, narrow-minded comments of his backbencher, WA Senator Ross 
Lightfoot, who today described people seeking refugee status as immoral, 
queue-jumping criminals capable of spreading communicable diseases.

Â

Mr Anderson should be embarrassed by Senator Lightfoot’s 
divisive and intolerant comments, coming so soon after Mr Anderson’s 
confused messages about Aborigines and welfare last week.

Â

Acting Shadow Immigration Minister, Martin Ferguson, 
said today the Labor Party supported the Government’s introduction 
of the three-year temporary visa to help stem the tide of people smuggling 
to Australia - because people smugglers are the target, not genuine 
refugees.

Â

“Senator Lightfoot must be confused about this issue 
because, on the one hand, he supports the three-year temporary visa 
for new arrivals but, on the other, he attacks the Labor Party which 
supported the new visa requirements,” Mr Ferguson said.

Â

“The Senator is obviously more interested in playing 
the race card in a vain attempt to score points for the WA coalition 
parties in an election year, rather than solving the complicated issue 
of handling the growing number of people seeking refugee status.

Â

“The real villains are the people smugglers, not 
potential legitimate refugees, and it is time for the Federal Government 
to defend its own policy stance against the extremist views of Senator 
Lightfoot and WA Premier Richard Court,” Mr Ferguson said.

Â

“Senator Lightfoot talks about illegal immigrants 
bringing with them their intolerances, but he should take a good look 
at himself.

Â

“John Anderson must publicly bring Senator Lightfoot 
into line or stand accused of letting his backbenchers peddle divisive, 
intolerant and racial views.
