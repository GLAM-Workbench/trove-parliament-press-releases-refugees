Nauru cannot continue, Inquiry report reveals

Children are being assaulted, women are unsafe and the detention camp on Nauru  cannot be allowed to continue in its current form, a Senate Inquiry report has said today.

“It can’t be made any clearer that locking children up with the guards on Nauru is  exposing them to abuse,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.

“The government’s head-in-the-sand approach to mounting evidence of systemic child  abuse is causing immeasurable harm.

“Nauru’s legal system has collapsed, its police force is not capable of protecting women  and children and there is a sinister culture of secrecy that hangs heavy over the camp.  No one there is safe.

“Journalists and independent human rights groups clearly need to be allowed into the  centre.

“It was deeply disappointing to see, on the day of the release of this report, the  government is sticking with Transfield Services for another five years. It’s shameful that,  instead of acting to protect vulnerable women and children, the government has  rewarded Transfield for the culture of cover up and secrecy on Nauru.

“Being personally spied on while I visited Nauru was serious and deeply concerning.  This wasn’t just a few rogue employees, as the government and Wilsons Security tried to  make out. It’s clear the lawlessness on the island means that anyone who goes there is  a possible target of bullying and intimidation. If this is how they treat a Federal Senator,  it’s no wonder refugees are regularly exposed to serious abuse.

“It’s clear that the Nauru camp needs to be shut down, before more damage is done, but  at the very least the current contractors who are running the camp should be sacked.”
