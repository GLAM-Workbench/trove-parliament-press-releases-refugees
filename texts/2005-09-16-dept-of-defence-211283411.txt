Deputy Chief of Joint Operations



Presentation to Defence Watch

16 September 2005



Thank  you  for  your  very  kind  introduction.   It  is  my  pleasure  to  be  with  you

today  and  to  have  the  opportunity  to  provide  you  with  an  update  on  ADF

operations.  I also intend to share with you a couple of issues that I am tackling

as the Vice Chief of the Defence Force and to give you my views on what I see

are  relevant  points  for  this  morning’s  presentation.   I  should  state  right  at  the

outset that I have been VCDF now for just over two months and, despite nearly

Page 2 of 30

38 years of service, my learning curve has been very steep indeed.  So I’m still

settling into my job and several of the points I will make this morning need to

accepted as my “early views”.

There was an article in the Daily Telegraph a couple of Tuesdays back, I think

by  Nicolette  Burke,  which  commented  on  social  trends  in  the  community.   It

caught  my  eye  because  the  study  apparently  concluded  that  the  average

Australian has a considerable degree of confidence in our Defence Force while

at  the  same  time  that  average  Australian  is  losing  confidence  in  many  other

private  and  public  institutions.   Now,  it’s  not  my  purpose  to  answer  here  why

there might be confidence in the military but not in others, but we in the ADF

are  obviously  very  pleased  that  there  appears  to  be  strong  community

confidence in what we do.

I would however like to say that, from my perspective, one very key reason for

public confidence is undoubtedly the remarkable performance of our young men

and women on operations.  I returned late last week from visiting our people in

the  Middle  East  and,  as  always,  it  was  truly  heart-warming  and  immensely

encouraging  to  see  how  well  these  young  Australians  are  performing.   They

really  are  very  effective  as  coalition  members  and  as  rebuilders  of  Iraqi

institutions  and  infrastructure.   Of  course  Iraq  isn’t  the  only  country  in  which

our people are operating, and we’ll discuss more on our other operational tasks

shortly.

Page 3 of 30

It is a simple but important fact that we have a track record of being successful

on operations, whether it is in Sumatra or the Solomons, in Timor or Iraq, in the

Sudan  or  the  Balkans,  or  now  again  in  Afghanistan.   While  the  countries  I’ve

mentioned  are  not  an  exhaustive  list  of  our  current  or  past  operations

destinations,  they  do  show  the  broad  geographical  spread  of  our  contributions.

They  also  show  the  wide  spectrum  of  tasks  we  have  undertaken  or  are

undertaking.

Well so what?  I think that my first point of the day comes from a simplistic bit

of  link  analysis.   If  you  link  geographic  dispersal,  broad  tasking  regimes,

concurrent operations and our clear track record of success, you can see that we

have been doing, on behalf of our nation, a lot of things very well.  Clearly our

individual  and  collective  training  regimes  are  equal  to  any  in  the  world,  and  I

believe  better  than  most.   We  equip  our  soldiers,  sailors  and  airmen  and

airwomen  very  well.   And  we  provide  them  with  the  guidance  and  rules  of

engagement  necessary  for  them  to  excel  in  their  missions.   Now  this  isn’t  a

political  pitch.   I  believe  very  much  in  the  words  I’ve  just  used,  and  I’m  on

record as advising the Prime Minister on the eve of the departure of the AMTG

to Iraq that I thought these were the best equipped soldiers ever to have left our

shores.

Page 4 of 30

This  didn’t  occur  through  happenstance.   The  agility  and  proactive  approach

shown by the Services, many Departmental agencies - especially the DMO, and

several  industry  bodies,  was  first  class;  as  was  the  ability  of  the  soldiers  to

quickly absorb and master new equipments and skills.

This record of success is one of which we are very proud, and one I intend to do

my part to keep.  I see our Defence ‘ship’ as being fundamentally sound. And in

my time as VCDF and the Chief of Joint Operations I see my role as continuing

to help CDF fine tune the running gear, making the crew better coordinated and

more  equally  tasked  and  making  sure  that  we  can  come  to  varying  degrees  of

action station many times over what will certainly be a long and busy voyage.

In many ways the issues I will raise this morning are all about maintaining and

improving our record of success and about getting “the ship” ready for the next

leg of the voyage.  But before you hear any more from me, I want to give you an

update  on  ADF  current  operations  across  the  globe.   To  give  you  that  update

may  I  introduce  my  Deputy  Chief  of  Joint  Operations,  Rear  Admiral  Rowan

Moffitt.

Page 5 of 30

(Rear Admiral Moffitt presentation: Current Operations)

Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Today  there  are  a  little  over  1,700  men  and  women  of  the  Australian  Defence

Force  deployed  around  the  world  as  it  appears  on  this  picture,  on  14  activities

designated  as  operations.   This  is  well  down  on  the  recent  peak,  which  was

about 6,500 in 1999/2000 when we were in Timor in strength but the geographic

spread  of  our  operational  commitments  remains  as  broad  today  as  it  was  then,

despite the smaller numbers of people deployed.

Our  people  are  still  deployed  from  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  in  the  west,

through  our  western,  northern  and  southern  sovereign  areas  to  the  eastern

approaches in the South West Pacific.

Their activities cover a wide variety of military operations, from so-called peace

operations  like  humanitarian  assistance,  through  to  combat,  and  much  in

between.

I’m  going  to  take  the  next  fifteen  minutes  or  so  to  bring  you  up  to  date  with

what our people are doing on these operations.

Let me start close to home.

Page 6 of 30

Operation  RELEX  is  the  ADF-led  operation  to  detect,  intercept  and  deter

unauthorised boat arrivals from entering Australia via our maritime approaches.

RELEX started in September 2001 and today involves units or people from all

three Services, supported by Coastwatch and Customs. The RELEX task group

is made up of one frigate and up to four patrol boats, an AP-3C Orion maritime

patrol  aircraft  and  an  Army  security  element.   A  second  Orion  is  available  if

required.

The Commander of the new Joint Offshore Protection Command, Rear Admiral

Russ  Crane,  has  recently  taken  over  command  of  RELEX  and  all  military  and

civilian forces assigned to it.

Operation CRANBERRY is the ADF commitment to the program of civil

maritime surveillance of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone.  The focus is

illegal fishing more recently augmented security patrols of the oil and gas

platforms on the North West Shelf.

Most of the activity associated with Cranberry is to the north of the country.

Again, the Commander of the Joint Offshore Protection Command now has

responsibility for Cranberry and the civil equivalent operations supporting this

resource protection outcome.

Navy  is  contracted  to  provide  1,800  days  of  Navy  surface  patrol  and  response

each  year  and  Air  Force  contributes  250  P3  Orion  hours  for  maritime

surveillance.

Page 7 of 30

Army  also  contributes,  with  its  three  Regional  Force  Surveillance  Units,  The

Pilbara Regiment, Norforce and 51 Far North Queensland Regiment conducting

land  surveillance  in  their  remote  areas  of  operation  that  complement  on  land

what the Navy and RAAF are doing in the maritime domain.

The ADF also provides specialist personnel, training, equipment and

intelligence support to the Customs’ operation to enforce sovereignty, protect

our resources and meet our treaty obligations in the Southern Ocean.  For us,

this is Operation MISTRAL.

A more significant level of support to the Customs operations can be undertaken

through Operation CELESTA, which is the conduct of fisheries patrols to the

Southern Ocean EEZs around Heard Island or McDonald Island by Navy ships

with Air Force support.  Five such patrols have been conducted.

The operational area for Mistral and Celesta is the most inhospitable water space

in the world and Australia’s territories are an awfully long way from the

mainland, in fact closer to Antarctica than to Australia.

These two factors make for very challenging operations for our people.

On shore, through Operation ACOLYTE the ADF will provide support to the

2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.  We have 15 personnel involved in

planning and coordinating ADF support to the State Government and Victoria

Police for the games and while full detail of our involvement has not yet been

Page 8 of 30

announced by the Government, this number will grow significantly for the

games proper.

Moving to operations outside Australia, I will start with our involvement in the

Solomon Islands under Operation ANODE as part of the Regional Assistance

Mission to Solomon Islands or RAMSI.  Known locally as Operation HELPEM

FREN, Australian servicemen and women work within a multi-national and

multi-agency assistance group led by the Australian Federal Police working to

support of the Solomon Islands Government in re-establishing the rule of law in

what has been a very troubled country.

I think it is worthwhile to note that since the commencement of this operation,

RAMSI forces have removed some 7000 weapons and 300,000 rounds of

ammunition from circulation and helped normalcy return to island life.

The ADF contributes 13 headquarters staff and an infantry platoon (minus) to

RAMSI.

Page 9 of 30

Operation CHIRON is Australia’s ongoing commitment to East Timor.

From  a  peak  of  about  5,500  people  in  1999,  today  we  have  3  people  working

within  the  UN  Office  in  Timor  Leste  (UNOTIL).  UNOTIL  is  the  follow  on

mission to UN Mission to East Timor (UNMISET, to us Operation SPIRE), the

mandate for which ceased on 20 May 05.

Up in the south east Asian area, Air Force P3 Orion aircraft still routinely

conduct surveillance patrols of the approaches to the Malacca Straits under

Operation Gateway, which has been an active operation now for almost 25

years.

In a similar style of activity, Air Force conducts periodic airborne maritime

surveillance in support Forum Fisheries Agency member states in the south west

Pacific area and has been doing so since 1983 under Operation Solania.

The operations I’ve mentioned so far, those closest to Australia, are all similar in

that they are non-warlike activities, using our parlance, with little risk of combat

being encountered.  For the operations I will now talk about, our people are

daily doing challenging work either in harm’s way or under constant threat of it.

Operation  CATALYST  is  our  commitment  to  the  reconstruction  and

rehabilitation  of  Iraq,  where  we  currently  have  about  1,400  people  of  all  three

Services in an area of operations that spreads across a significant portion of the

Middle East.

Page 10 of 30

I  find  it  interesting  how  many  people  in  the  wider  community  see  our

involvement in the Middle East as a relatively new initiative.  The fact is that we

have now been on operations in the Arabian Gulf almost continuously for half as

long  again  as  we  were  involved  in  Vietnam  -  nearly  fifteen  years  in  total.   In

some  areas  of  the  Middle  East  we  have  maintained  a  continuous  albeit  small

presence since 1956.

On  Operation  Catalyst  we  have  several  ‘big  ticket’  capabilities  in  terms  of

numbers of people, as well as many smaller numbers and individuals embedded

in coalition units.  The major groups are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ firstly  Army’s  450  strong  Al  Muthanna  Task  Group,  drawn  primarily

from the Darwin-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment and 5/7th Battalion RAR.

The  AMTG  is  providing  security  for  a  Japanese  engineer  force  doing

reconstruction  and  humanitarian  assistance  work,  as  well  as  training

soldiers of the Iraqi Army's new 10th Division in and around As Samawah,

in the south east of the country,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ two air force Hercules and two Orion aircraft and their associated support

groups, a total of around 250 people,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a  Navy  frigate,  currently  HMAS  NEWCASTLE,  which  contributes  to  a

multinational force protecting the oil platforms in the north Arabian Gulf

through which Iraq exports the oil that earns it the bulk of its GDP, and

Page 11 of 30

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the  Security  Detachment  in  Baghdad,  which  protects  the  people  of  our

diplomatic mission and national force headquarters,

Among  the  smaller  contributions,  we  have  middle  ranking  and  more  senior

officers embedded in a range of headquarters staffs where they are usually held

in high regard and making a significant contribution that has earned the ADF an

enviable reputation.  Specialist teams are doing similar great work in Australia’s

name, among them:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ an  Australian  Army  Training  Team  assisting  the  Iraqi  Army  to  develop  a

self-sufficient  logistics  capability.   The  fourth  such  team  is  currently

deployed, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in Balad, to the north of Baghdad, a team of some 15 medical personnel and

an Air Traffic Control detachment.

ADF operations in support of the so called Global War on Terror are conducted

under the banner of Operation SLIPPER.  The Navy frigate and Air Force

Orion aircraft I mentioned earlier are dual assigned to both Op CATALYST and

Op SLIPPER.

Page 12 of 30

Within the last few weeks the ADF has significantly increased its forces

assigned to Operation SLIPPER with the deployment of a 190 personnel Special

Forces Task Group to Afghanistan for 12 months.  The task group is operational

now against resurgent Taliban and anti-coalition militia forces that are actively

trying to disrupt Provincial Assembly elections that are scheduled for this

Sunday.

We are also examining how Australia might contribute to Afghanistan’s

reconstruction with a military provincial reconstruction team that would deploy

to Afghanistan in mid-2006, if the Government agrees that this is a worthwhile

thing for the ADF to do.

The Army also has a single specialist deployed to Afghanistan to assist with

land mine clearance and the management of unexploded ordnance removal

under Op SLIPPER.  This has been a contribution we have made to helping

cleanup the most heavily mined country in the world since 2003.

Our contribution to Afghanistan is completed by another single Army officer

who is attached to the UN Assistance Mission under Operation PALATE,

which again has been active since 2003.

Page 13 of 30

All our forces in the Middle East operate in a challenging if not downright harsh

natural environment made immeasurably more dangerous by the constant threat

of being attacked directly by fanatical, even suicidal enemy forces that are not

easily identified, or indirectly by their very clever improvised devices of death

and destruction.

In  the  Middle  East  we  are  subject  to  the  full  complexity  of  modern  military

operations which no longer fall into neat types or phases of activity.

At  any  one  instant,  our  forces  are  being  called  upon  to  engage  in  combat,

enforce  peace,  build  or  rebuild  vital  infrastructure,  train  security  forces  of  the

host country and provide a range of humanitarian assistance.  This is the heart of

the  challenge  for  the  ADF  in  making  sure  our  people  are  properly  and

sufficiently broadly trained individually, as well as being prepared collectively,

for deployment. It’s a challenge that is quite different from what we have faced

in previous generations of deployments.

I will wrap up my part of our presentation to you today with three operations -

MAZURKA, PALADIN and AZURE.

Page 14 of 30

Operation MAZURKA is Australia's contribution to the Multinational Force

and Observers in the Sinai.  The MFO was established in 1981 to oversee the

Camp David Accords of 1978 and the Egypt/Israel Peace Treaty of 1979.

There  are  25  Australians  who  assist  in  the  peace  process  by  monitoring  the

border between Egypt and Israel and supporting the Headquarters of the MFO.

Operation PALADIN is Australia's contribution to the UN Truce Supervision

Organisation.  UNTSO was established in 1948 to supervise the truce agreed at

the  conclusion  of  the  first  Arab/Israeli  War  and  operates  in  Israel,  Syria,

Lebanon and Egypt.

ADF  personnel  are  deployed  as  unarmed  military  observers  on  the  Golan

Heights and in Southern Lebanon as well as filling a number of staff positions at

the  UN  headquarters  in  Jerusalem  and  various  outstations.   The  current

commitment is 12 personnel.

Finally, 15 personnel are in the Sudan in the first ADF operation under the

command of a woman - Operation AZURE, which contributes to the UN

Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), the objective of which is to improve stability and

the maintenance of peace in Sudan.

On that note, I’ll hand back to VCDF.

Page 15 of 30

(Lieutenant General Gillespie continues)

Both  Admiral  Moffitt  and  I  will  be  very  happy  to  take  questions  on  these

operations  at  the  end  of  the  presentation.   Please  be  mindful  that  we  may  be

constrained  in  some  of  our  answers  because  of  any  operational  security

requirements which may apply.

As I have already stated, I am both the Vice Chief of the Defence Force and the

Chief of Joint Operations.  All deployed forces are under my command.  I am

responsible  to  the  CDF  for  the  successful  execution  of  ADF  operations  and

through  the  CDF  I  am  responsible  to  Government  for  the  achievement  of

Defence Outcome 1 - Command of Operations In Defence of Australia and its

National Interests.

At this point I want to talk about command. There is one important point about

command that is sometimes forgotten.  That point is that command is a verb not

a  noun:  it  is  a  doing  word,  it  requires  action  and  involvement  to  exercise

command.  Command of operations demands energy, strategic clarity and clear

direction. It then requires a capable, professional staff to not only help develop

plans,  but  also  then  to  control  the  execution  of  those  plans.  This  nexus  of

command and control is central to how we in the ADF direct, plan and conduct

operations.

In simple terms, Joint Operations Command, which I command, brings together

the  former  Headquarters  Australian  Theatre,  along  with  the  operational

Page 16 of 30

functions of our existing Maritime, Land and Air Headquarters.  The Command

also  now  incorporates  two  specialist  headquarters  -  Special  Operations

Command and Joint Logistics Command.  As well there are a number of direct

command  units  such  as  Northern  Command  based  in  Darwin,  Strategic

Operations Division in Canberra, the ADF Warfare Centre in Williamtown, the

Joint  Operations  Intelligence  Centre,  based  in  Sydney  and  the  1st  Joint

Movements  Group,  also  based  in  Sydney.   Our  newest  command  is  the  Joint

Offshore Protection Command, which I will speak more about shortly.

Command and control is clearly not a new concept in the ADF, far from it.  But

command  and  control  requirements  have  changed  over  the  years  and  will

continue to change.  Most of you will remember that the position now held by

my  deputy,  Rowan  Moffitt,  was  previously  that  of  Commander  Australian

Theatre,  the  ADF’s  first  real  attempt  to  instil  a  permanent  joint  flavour  to  the

command and control of operations at the operational level.

We have moved on from there and Commander Australian Theatre as a concept

is  now  consigned  to  our  knowledge  base  and  my  role  as  the  Chief  of  Joint

Operations,  or  CJOPS,  has  largely  taken  its  place.   This  change  came  about

because of lessons we’d learned over the past few years and it demonstrates our

preparedness to change or adapt.

This change and adaptation in our command and control system is one of the

most dynamic areas of development over the last ten years. We have moved

Page 17 of 30

very quickly to a joint model of command and control of operations, and I think

it fair to say that our recent successes on operations are because of this

development and not in spite of it.

Currently  underway  is  a  review  of  our  higher  command  and  control  structure.

This is due for delivery to the CDF and Secretary in December this year.  One of

the key reasons for that review is the impending move to Bungendore.  But that

is not the only reason, nor even the most important.

There  has  been  a  growing  realisation  that  our  joint  command  and  control

structure  has  some  artificial  and  self-imposed  barriers  which  have  been

preventing  the  best  utilisation  of  our  workforce.   Some  levels  of  workload

duplication  and  the  subsequent  detrimental  effects  on  efficiency  and

effectiveness are evident.  This situation is not helped, of course, by my deputy

and his staff being in Sydney and some of my other staff being in Canberra and

Melbourne, but the problem is more than physical dislocation.

Far more fundamental is our growing acceptance that the rather neat way we had

always divided the layers of command between the strategic, the operational and

tactical levels was becoming so blurred as to make strict separation of functions

unnecessary and even unhelpful.

There  are  a  few  reasons  for  this  blurring  and  I  suppose  you  could  say  that  the

vastly  improved  communications  and  situational  awareness  systems  we  now

have,  the  increased  scrutiny  of  all  our  operations,  the  relatively  small  but

Page 18 of 30

strategically important forces we send overseas, and, I think, the general interest

in  Defence  Force  operations  reported  by  many  of  you  in  the  audience,  all

contribute  to,  if  not  collapsing  the  levels  of  war,  to  at  least  dramatically

compressing the time available for interaction between them.  While the separate

strategic,  operational  and  tactical  functions  still  exist,  and  need  to  exist  for

appropriate  and  detailed  planning,  what  has  changed  is  both  our  ability,  and

need,  to  very  quickly  move  across  and  between  the  three  levels.   Modern

commanders and staff need an agility in both process and intellectual thought to

be able to conceptualise across all levels simultaneously.

Exactly how we will do this is the purpose of the current review and it would be

inappropriate  to  talk  in  too  much  detail  before  the  review  is  complete  and

delivered to the Chief of Service Committee and Government.  What I can say is

this:  we  will  stream-line  our  joint  headquarters,  we  will  remove  unnecessary

duplication from the structure, and we will have fewer but more substantial, and

integrated, operations, planning and intelligence centres.

Page 19 of 30

At  the  operational  and  strategic  levels  we  will  remove  artificial  barriers,  and

levels  of  command  and  control,  so  that  we  can  decrease  the  time  taken  in

decision  making  cycles  and  take  greater  military  advantage  of  the  speed  that

modern technology, communications and networking can provide us.

We will look very carefully at our current Component Method of command and

consider more fully whether we need to move to an integrated fully-joint model.

There  is  still  a  fair  bit  of  water  to  flow  under  the  bridge  before  we  make  firm

decisions, but there are two particular areas that I do want to discuss.

The first is Bungendore. I mentioned the Bungendore project in passing a little

earlier  in  my  presentation.   For  those  who  are  not  aware,  this  is  a  Defence

project  to  build  a  joint  operations  headquarters  outside  the  village  of

Bungendore, near Queanbeyan in NSW.

This joint operations headquarters will allow us to collocate many of our current

headquarters  and  functions.   The  project  is  progressing  well  and  current

planning suggests we will occupy the new facility some time in 2008.

Bungendore cannot, and will not, be the same old system in a new building: we

will  use  the  opportunity  this  project  presents  to  design  new  ways  of  doing  our

business better.  My headquarters in its current form is physically dislocated and

as such does not contain some of the key executive functions necessary for me

to  mount  and  sustain  operations  from  within  my  own  organisation  alone.

Page 20 of 30

Intelligence,  Communications  Personnel  Policy  and  Strategic  Policy  functions

are all vital to me in achieving operational success.  These functions exist in the

wider  Defence  organisation,  outside  the  ADF.   With  the  support  of  the

Secretary,  the  CDF  and  the  appropriate  Deputy  Secretaries,  I  have  already

moved  to  integrate  these  functions  more  fully  into  the  military  operations

planning function and I am already getting better quality advice and support at

the strategic level.  For example DDIO is now my strategic intelligence adviser,

the  deputy  CIO  is  now  my  strategic  communications  adviser,  and  the  HSP  is

now my military strategic planning adviser.  These advisers are now being more

formally integrated into my Joint Commanders Planning and Orders processes.

I  am  also  currently  closely  engaged  with  LTGEN  David  Hurley,  the  Chief

Capability  Development  Group,  and  his  staff  to  determine  how  we  can  better

coordinate joint operations input into the capability development process.

The new ADF leadership group is united behind CDF and are individually very

supportive  of  the  changes  taking  place,  of  the  C2  Review  principles  and

processes and of the need to flatten the Joint Headquarters structure.

The  pace  of  change  is  quick  and  for  me  necessarily  so.   The  occupation  of

Bungendore is only three years away and we have much to accomplish in that

time if we are to manage the change process, develop new operational processes

and occupy a new facility, in a new organisational structure, while at the same

Page 21 of 30

time remaining appropriately postured to meet the requirements placed upon us

by Government.

The second area of important growth for us is the new Joint Offshore Protection

Command  officially  established  in  March  this  year.  While  the  Joint  Offshore

Protection  Command,  or  JOPC,  is  to  some  extent  a  conglomeration  of  several

elements of Coastwatch, Customs and Defence, it is an important step forward.

Not only do we now have an organisation specifically focused on our Nation’s

maritime  protection,  but  it  also  provides  us  with  a  leading  edge  inter-agency

organisation  capable  of  meeting  the  new  challenges  of  security  and  defence  in

our maritime zones.

The evolution of the JOPC is helping us work through all sorts of issues to do

with  how  we  support  two  Ministers,  either  of  whom  could  carry  the  principal

accountability  for  a  given  security  or  defence  situation,  and  the  transition  that

might  occur  in  an  incident  which  migrates  between  civilian  and  military

jurisdiction.  I have recently conducted some focussed wargames with my senior

commanders to work through the issues, and we are bringing to conclusion the

manning and administrative arrangements for the new command.

My  primary  aim  over  the  coming  months  is  for  us  to  test  and  stress  the  new

command  in  order  to  build  an  experience  base  and  to  develop  the  robust

strategies, contingencies and plans necessary to ensure success. I am very happy

with JOPC progress to date.

Page 22 of 30

Another area that I do need to touch on is perhaps less glamorous than

operations, but is vital to operations sustainment and for Defence management

as a whole.  I’m speaking of the management and reporting in the joint logistics

system.

The accuracy of Defence asset reporting was one of the issues that led to the

qualification of the Defence Accounts for Financial Year 2002/2003.  The

Secretary, Mr Ric Smith, has provided considerable leadership to this problem,

and has driven a significant effort to address our shortcomings in this regard.

Recently there have been a number of audits of Defence stores holdings

conducted by the Australian National Audit Office, Management Audit Branch

and Deloittes.  These audits have enabled us to clearly scope our procedural and

structural shortcomings and the Secretary has set in place the level of reform

necessary for us to achieve success in the future.  As VCDF, helping Ric to

achieve a successful completion of this endeavour is my highest non-operational

priority for this year.

I know that many in the audience are from industry, and interested particularly

in defence industry and capability development, so let me address this area as

my last point.

As VCDF I sit on COSC and the DC and I am an invited member to the Defence

Capability Investment Committee (DCIC). I am sure the ‘hawks’ among you are

well aware of these key acronyms and their meaning!

Page 23 of 30

There has in the past been some thought that in my role as CJOPS I should have

little to do with capability development.  I don’t share this view.  It is very clear

to me that I cannot sit in splendid operations isolation from the capability

process.  I am the end-user of whatever is delivered and I am responsible for

success on operations.  So I clearly have a vested interest in any future

capability development.

There are three new developments in this regard.  Firstly, I have recently

double-hatted one of my brigadiers, Spike McKaskill the Commandant of the

ADF Warfare Centre, as my capability development adviser.  Secondly, I now

agree the operational requirements for rapid acquisition and thirdly, I am now

the sponsor for joint simulation.

It’s early days yet, but we are striking new ground and the relationship we are

developing between myself, the Service Chiefs, CCDG, Deputy Secretary

Strategy and the Head of the DMO is fresh and strong.

But what of some of the more recent industry aspects of operations? From my

perspective, as the end-user of defence capability and the accountable officer for

our success on operations, I would have to say that the progress in industry

support has been dramatic, effective and very welcome.  Let me touch on a few

aspects.

While a lot of attention is on Iraq, one of our most interesting operations from a

point of view of looking at trends in the way we might do business in the future,

is our operation in the Solomons, Operation ANODE.  This operation is

significant for a few reasons: first, it is not Defence lead but is a police led inter-

agency activity.  And, second, we have contracted out the logistics and medical

support to the operation.  This was a first, amidst all sorts of dire predictions of

failure, but it has worked remarkably well.  It reminds us that it is possible to not

only deploy contractors to an area of operations, but actually give them carriage

of logistics support for a multi-agency and international operation.  I see

significant growth in this area for future operations, but only where it is

appropriate.

We have also required timely and unscheduled support for the protection of our

deployed troops.  Together with DSTO and industry we worked very quickly

and produced several new types of combat body armour utilising leading edge

technologies.  We then had the troops use it on operations, increasing their

protection while at the same time incorporating the lessons learned for future

models.

Having worn the new kit myself last week I can say that it is comfortable,

adaptable for different operational circumstances and as good as anything else

available.  Our combined efforts here show that we are both responsive to the

needs of our troops and uncompromising in getting the best available kit to our

troops when they need it.

The same goes for our vehicles and, again, industry rose to the challenge and

provided our deployed troops with world class protection. The fitting of

technologically advanced spall liners to our ASLAVs was done in record time,

as was the procurement and fitting of the Kronsberg Remote Weapon Stations

and an Australian designed and produced Bar Armour System.  These three

capabilities are leading edge technologies and were rapidly designed and

acquired to meet evolving operational requirements.

The rapid finishing and deployment of our new Bushranger protected mobility

vehicles not only gave our deployed troops the protection they needed, but also

removed in a heartbeat any lingering concern over the capabilities of these home

grown vehicles.  There is nothing like success on operations to install faith in

military equipment, and the Diggers’ endorsements of both the ASLAV and the

Bushranger have been loud and glowing.  The capabilities of the ASLAVs and

an understanding of the soldiers faith in them is clearly evident from two

brushes with improvised explosive devices in Baghdad and a number of

skirmishes involving our training teams in Northern Iraq.  These explosive

Page 26 of 30

devices used against us in Baghdad were little different to the ones that have

killed and wounded other coalition forces.  Survival in our case had a certain

amount of luck but I, and more importantly the troops involved, attribute it

mainly to our training and the outstanding equipment that industry has delivered

to our men and women.

We are looking closely at acquiring micro and perhaps tactical UAVs with a

view to deploying them on operations in the near future.  There has been close

cooperation with DSTO on this project and we are leveraging off their studies to

develop what will be a robust capability.

We have fitted advanced self-protection systems to our C130s and our P3s

allowing them to operate alongside our allies in Iraq with increased surety, and

to increase the suite of missions they can conduct.  We are looking at similar

options for some of our helicopters to enable us to provide Government with

more flexible force options should they decide to deploy these aircraft into

hostile environments at some future time.

There is an obvious message here.  That message is that the partnership with

industry is working and the responsiveness and agility being displayed by all

concerned on both sides is evident and getting pleasing results.  We can always

do better, and you will all know of the great work being undertaken by Dr

Gumley and LTGEN Hurley and their teams in this regard.

I mentioned earlier that I now approve the capability requirements of rapid

acquisition. As the end user I am determined to make this process as quick, as

transparent, and as effective as possible.  We have used the needs of deployed

troops to scrub over the process once again. We have cut the rapid acquisition

process from months to weeks.  This has been achieved because of tremendous

good will on the part of all concerned, as well as very long hours and great

agility by dedicated Defence staff.  But the proof is there: our troops have the kit

when they need it, where they need it and they are the envy of soldiers from

other nations. I reject any suggestion, and we hear a few, that our deployed

troops are somehow under-done or lack the latest equipment.

I thank industry for its efforts in the partnership that has seen our troops so well

equipped, and I can tell you that you have a champion in me to keep that

partnership warm and close.

In terms of Joint Operating Concepts and massing joint effects I am very happy

with the direction in which we are now heading.  In the future I am confident

that we will continue to have the ability to contribute forces to the types of

operations we do now, perhaps slightly more effectively and certainly more

safely as our tank and attack helicopter capabilities mature our ability to operate

in very complex terrain.

Before I take questions, let me finish by commenting on the most important part

of our Defence capability, and that is our people.  All the plans and reviews we

conduct mean nothing and will fail without the good will and support of our

people. I mentioned as I started this presentation that I have just come back from

the Middle East and that I thought that you should all be justifiably proud of our

young Australians.  They’re doing everything we could possibly ask of them,

and doing it with great professionalism and achieving great effect.  The award of

the DFC to Major Scott Watkins by the UK is just the latest example of coalition

nations giving recognition to what I’ve been saying.  Many others have received

foreign recognition while our own honours lists attest to the nature of our

people.  Our ADF people are fantastic citizens, but they can’t achieve the

success they do without the support of the whole Defence organisation and our

civilian workforce needs also to share in the accolades levied at our troops.

CDF is determined that we continue to address the policy issues that keep or

people motivated and supported when deployed. We are currently conducting a

Nature of Service Review that not only addresses some of the anomalies in

previous operations but also allows a more objective assessment of the nature

current and future operations.

One of the small but vital organisations I command is the National Welfare

Coordination Centre.  I visited them in Randwick last month and they are a

dedicated bunch working 24/7 to meet the needs of our deployed troops. In Iraq

I was very pleased to see considerable effort to provide welfare communications

for our troops so that our forces have access to telephones and e-mail to keep in

touch with their families. Incidentally, we have had the opportunity to bench-

mark our support compared to other members of the coalition and I am pleased

to say that we come out well on top of any comparison.

Any of our deployed troops who serve on operations for six months are entitled

to leave out of country. While we have good systems in place to ensure the

troops get that leave, we are now factoring in the effect of the absence of troops

on leave on the deployed unit.

At anyone time about 10% of a deployed unit will be on leave which can mean a

corresponding 10% increase in the workload of their mates still deployed. So we

are now commencing to factor that percentage in to our plans when we look at

personnel numbers.

What this all points to is that we mean what we say: our people are our greatest

asset and we look after them well. I don’t accept that our success to date, and

our minimal casualties, is because we are in safe places avoiding the hard bits.

That is unfair on our troops and is not the case anyway.

We have been in the middle of Baghdad since it fell and are now on operations

in Afghanistan in hostile terrain. We have been attacked in Iraq and we have

survived. While there is always an amount of luck involved I am one of those

who believe that you make your own luck.

In our case the quality of our people and our excellent training and equipment

combine to go a long way towards our success.

I finish where I started: to be Vice Chief and responsible for our success on

operations, with these motivated and highly professional people, is a rare and

singular privilege and I wouldn’t swap it for anything.
