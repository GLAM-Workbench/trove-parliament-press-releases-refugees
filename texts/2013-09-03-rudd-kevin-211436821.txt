HOST: Mr Rudd spoke a short time ago to political correspondent Sabra Lane, she  began by asking the PM if he agreed with Tony Abbott’s claim that the election will  be a referendum on the Carbon Tax?

PRIME MINISTER: Well, Mr Abbott walked away completely from the international  targets which I thought both sides of politics shared, in an interview last night, and  basically he said that our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent  below 2000 levels by 2020 is something he’d be prepared easily to walk away from. I  don’t believe that’s an acceptable or responsible response. When the history of this  period is written it will be about who took action on global warming, who introduced  the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target - 20% by 2020 - who brought in the  carbon price and who ratified Kyoto and who opposed all of those things, virtually.

I think this is irresponsible for the future.

HOST: Aren’t you verballing Mr Abbott there? He says that the Coalition supports a  bipartisan target of five per cent cut by 2020.

PM: Mr Abbott said that if his so-called Direct Action plan doesn’t work then so be it,  and that he would simply, therefore, break his pledge on Australia’s international  commitment to reduce carbon pollution to five per cent below 2000 by 2020. If every  government took that position that he has taken, what’s the net consequence? The  net consequence is that all governments would walk away from hard action on this.  The planet would continue to endure global warming and as a result, we’d provide a  very uncertain future for our kids. I think the contrast is very clear and reflects poor  judgement.



HOST: Getting back to the point of the question, would Labor block it?



PM: Our position as far as our policies for this election is absolutely clear, these are  the positions we are talking into the 2013 election. People will vote for them one way  or another. I’m in the business of this election in order to secure a win for the  Government because I believe that’s the best outcome for all Australians, including  on climate change.

HOST: And a couple of weeks ago you said that Labor had no mandate to introduce  a Carbon Tax. Haven’t you effectively, again, given voters permission to punish  Labor?

PM: What I have already indicated, at the point at which I returned to the Prime  Ministership, is I announced the end of the Carbon Tax and it’s change to an  Emissions Trading Scheme and a floating price. I find both on this question of  climate change and more broadly, our international obligations, a remarkable shall I

say, inability to grasp the core judgements for our nation’s future in terms of what Mr  Abbott is putting forward. We’ve been talking so far about climate change, let me  simply respond to something Mr Abbott said last night on the critical international  question of the day, which is Syria. It’s an extraordinary statement. Mr Abbott went  out last night and said that both sides of the Syrian conflict were two pretty much  equally unsavoury sides.

Well, we can all forgive perhaps him describing international relations as an exercise  between baddies and baddies or goodies and baddies. This is a stunning error of  judgement. Why? Australia recognises the Syrian National Coalition. The United  States recognises the Syrian National Coalition. The European Union recognises the

Syrian National Coalition. 80 countries around the world recognise the Syrian  National Coalition. If Mr Abbott is the Prime Minister on Sunday and because we are  president of the UN Security Council, is he going to send a direction to our  Ambassador in New York to derecognise the Syrian National Coalition? Because  they represented an equally unsavoury side. This would set off such a reaction in  Australian international relations and our standing across the world. People wouldn’t  just scratch their head, they’d walk away in horror at this appalling error of foreign  policy judgement.

HOST: Father Frank Brennan, someone who’s been a friend and confidant of yours  has described the Papua New Guinea asylum policy as morally unacceptable. How  do you respond to that?

PM: I have a deep and respectful relationship with Frank Brennan. We’ve talked  about these things over a long period of time and as I said last night in the debate on  these questions on the ABC on Q and A. What I said was we face a very, very  difficult set of decisions when it comes to people smugglers. On the one hand, our  ethical obligations to continue to increase - as we have done - our intake of refugees  from around the world through our humanitarian quota from camps and on the other  hand look at how we can practically stop increasing numbers of people coming to  Australia by boat, provided by people smugglers, where 1 in 13 of them drown. My  ethical response to that is what do you do to deter people from getting onto those  boats because such a large and increasing proportion of them over time are likely to  drown. That’s why we’ve taken the difficult decision that we have. It’s not an easy

decision but I would ask anyone listening to your program this morning, what is the  alternative response to hundreds and in the future thousands of people drowning.

HOST: With respect Mr Rudd, getting back to the point of the question, Father Frank  Brennan said it was morally unacceptable. How do you respond?

PM: I’ve just set forth how to explain a moral response to Frank’s critique and that is  if you’re faced with the moral question, the ethical question, of people drowning and  in large numbers, hundreds and then if numbers continue to increase coming by  boat, thousands. What do you do ethically to respond to that and if at the same time,  you are decreasing the number of people coming to this country though the official  refugee program whereby we are the country which takes the third largest number of  such people in the world and a rising number and we are one of the largest funders,  globally, of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Now, I believe they  are all elements of a moral response to the question you just put.

HOST: The Prime Minister Kevin Rudd speaking to Sabra Lane.
