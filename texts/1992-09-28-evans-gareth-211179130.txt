Address by-- Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade of Australia, to the Forty Seventh Session ,of  I  "

1 the General Assembly of the United Nations, New York,/ 28

September.l992.

I \Ã¢Â‘

I congratulate rou, Mr Ganev, on your election as President of

this Forty Seventh Session of the General Assembly. You take  this important position at a very challenging time for the UN and  its Member States, not least your own country which is

consolidating the gains of the democratisation process. The  Australian Delegation looks forward to working closely with you  as the session progresses.

I also extend, at the outset, Australia's very warm welcome to

the thirteen states for whom this session will be their first as  Members of the United Nations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Mpldova, San Marino, Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan, Ã¢Â‘ Uzbekistan, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have, I believe, in our own highly multicultural

Australian population immigrants from every one of these states,  and we already feel we know you well.

In the past year we have seen the total collapse of the bipolar  global structure which underpinned international relations since  1945. The ' risks of a global nuclear holocaust have receded  almost to vanishing point .. So too have the sterile ideologies of

the past which so long set obstacles to the development of a new  international system of co-operation under the authority of the  United Nations and its agencies.

But while the opportunities for cooperation have never been  ' . '

greater, the challenges to the international community posed by  regional conflicts, humanitarian crises and  transnational problems have also never been grea~er.

Expectations of the UN system are now immense, but there is still  a very big question mark over the capacity of our system to  deliver.

In the past twelve months, the international community has had  ' \.

some conspic~ous success in meeting some of these challenges. we  have seen, for example, the signature of the Paris Agreements on  Cambodia last October, the recently cornp1eted negot.iation of a  Chemical Weapons Convention teltt, the Rio UNCED Surnrni t in June,  movement forward in the Middle East peace process, and hopes for

the resolution of the long standing-problems in Afghanistan,  Cyp~s and Western Sahara.

But a number of problems have to date been beyond the capacity of  the UN, or international cooperative efforts more generally, to  resolve in a timely and wholly effective way. The most

significant and tragic of these have been the conflicts in the  former Yugoslavia and Somalia. Equally, the world has failed so  far in the efforts to strengthen and expand the liberal  international trading system through the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade negotiations in the GATT, a failure of just as  much concern to the developing nations as the developed.

This UN General Assembly gives us the opportunity of

systematically reviewing where we have got to, and how far we  still need to go, on the range of acute problems - political,  economic and humanitarian - now confronting us around-the globe.  We are much assisted in this respect by the Secretary-General's

report, An Agenda for Peace, on some key &Spects of which I want  to focus in this statement. The report, although concentrating  specifically on the UN's role in peace-making, peace-keeping and  related areas, was written very much against the background of  the total challenge facing the UN international system, and in  particular the critical. importance of finding lasting solutions  to the age-old problems of basic human survival and, in the words  of the Charter, ~better standards of life in larger freedom~.

If we have learned anything from the passage of years about the  sources of conflict and war, and what is necessary to achieve

peace and  addresssd  not only

3

security, it is that  at many different levels.  from military ambition

these problems have to bE;-Threats to security arise  and the race to acquire

armaments, but from economic and social  ignorance of countries about each other,  deprivation, from  from a failure to

cross international

. '.

I ;ddress ~roblems that by their nature

boundaries, and from a failure by national leaders to trust the  sense and judgment of their own people. An effective system of  international cooperation to meet threats to peace and security  itself has to operate at all these levels simultaneously.

The UN's Security Role: Intervention, Assistance and Prevention

In the first place, when unbridled aggression occurs across  national frontiers, the international community has to have a  credible collective capacity to resist that aggression. Chapter  Vli of the Charter provides such a peace enforcement function.  So long rendered impotent by the veto in the Security Council,

there is now in the post-Cold War era a manifest willingness in  the international community to utilise interventionist Chapter  VII functions in cases of overt aggression and other obvious  cross-border threats to international peace and security.

Of course not every case of aggression, or the deliberate  infliction of suffering, occurs across state borders or in such a  way as to clearly and unambiguously constitute a threat to  international peace and security. And there will be -a number of

such situations where the intervention of the international  community c~uld make a difference - so _. much so that there are  large moral and political pressures upon us all to take action.  It seems likely, unhappily, that the UN will be inc::::-easingly  confronted by situations where the principle of non-intervention

in internal affairs will be matched by a compelling sense of  international conscience. It may be that our Charter will never  be capable of formal amendment so a.s to precisely define those  circumstances where such intervention is legi tirnate and those  where it is not. But recent experience has shown that there is  an emerging willingness - which my country has certainly shared -to accommodate collective intervention in extreme conscience-

",

4

shocking cases, and it may well be that a body of cu~tomary  precedent will emerge over time that will constitute its own  source of authority for such intervention in the future.

The second level of necessary UN involvement in peace and  security matters is peace-keeping: that activity which falls  short of actual enforcement, but involves assistance on the  ground in monitoring, supervising, verifying and genera:l .ly  securing the implementation of agreements once made. As the  various peace-keeping operations now in place or planned fc.>r  Cambodia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere amply make clear ,  an increasingly wide variety of activities, involving botr.  military and civilian personnel, are being subsumed under this  general umbrella: none of them are very clea,rly described in the

letter of the DN Charter, but all of them are very clearly within  its spirit.

Australia strongly endorses the call by President Bush on 21  September to strengthen United Nations peace-keeping and related  operations, and welcomes in particular the stated intenticn of  the United States to look at ,ways of ensuring adequate financial

support for these activities as well as for the UN's humanitarian  activities. Financing and administration of UN peace-keeping  operations are obviously key areas of UN activity where decisions  are necessary at this year's General Assembly. It is a source of

regret that we, the nations of the world, have still not given  the UN Secretary-General the financial resources or flexibility  needed to undertake UN peace-keeping operations expeditiously.  For its part, Australia would support the Secretary-General's  call in An ~genda for Peace for the establishment at this Session  of a peace-keeping reserve fund, and for virtually automatic  approval of one-third of the anticipated budget for a -peace " keeping operation to enable it to be deployed speedily and  efficiently. We would also recommend that the Secreta~Ã¢Â‘-General  consider further structural changes in the Secretariat as a means  of improving the administration of peace-keeping operations,

including the relocation of the Field Operations Division into  the Office of Pe.ace-Keeping Affairs.

The third level of UN involvement in peace and security, and the  ~ost basic and important of all, is the prevention of conflict

before it occurs. We in the international communi 'ty shc "uld be  working hardest through the United Nations to create conditions  which minimise insecurity and threats to peace, and which enable,  specific high risk situations to be specifically addressed / -before they get to the point of requiring either peace-keeping  or, worse stiil, .coercive peace enforcement responses.

The effective prevention of conflict and ris~ minimisation  involves three quite distin~t kinds of activity. In the first  place, it involves addressing a variety of non-mili Ã¢Â‘tary threats  to security; secondly, addressing the milito .ry risk to security  posed by uncontrolled arms build-ups; and thirdly, putting in  place the most effective possible preventive diplomacy and peace-1  making arrangemen~s to deal at an early st~ge with specific high-,  risk situations. I want to concentrate my remarks on ..,.;hat we

should be doing, in this General Assembly and beyond, in each of  these areas in turn.

Non-Military Threats to Security

Among the gravest of all life-threatening non-military risks are  those posed by humanitarian disasters, especially famine. The  recurring tragedy of mass starvation in Africa - often made worse  by accompanying military conflict, but not wholly explained by  that conflict - ~nderlines the need for the United Nations system  as a whole, and the Security Council in particular, to strengthen  its capacity to meet the problems of potential famine. ~ J  Australia proposes the establishment of a group of senior  officials from developed and developing countries and relevant UN  agencies, supported by a strengthened Department of Humanitarian  Affairs and comprehensive data base, which would convene  regularly to conduct high level reviews of the global famine  situation and identify emerging crisis situations. It would be  responsible for turning pledges into timely, life-saving  deliveries of food to people in need, and would seek to ensure

that donor contributions were complementary, properly co-

6

ordinated and well-targeted. That High Level Review Group would  report regularly, with appropriate recommendations, to the  Security Council.

Famine is only the most extreme exampl~ of a much more widesp~ead  global problem. The Secretary-Gener ~ l, in his address to the' NAM  Summit, identified our 'ultimate enemy' as poverty. He argued  for the indivisibility of peace and prosperity, political and  economic security, democracy and development, and environmental  protection and sustainable development, making the point that

unless we meet the threat posed by poverty it will undermine all  the advances ~e ~ave made elsewhere. We need to have this fi~ly  in mind as we act for the rest of this decade and beyond to meet  non-military th~eats to peace and security.

There are two issues in particular, which will have a crucial  influence on our ability to prevail over these threats. One is  the retreat to protectionism which could well result from a  failure to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round, which will do  untold damage to many economies around the world, particularly  those of the poorest nations who would effectively be excluded

from the benefits of an expansion in world trade. We cannot let  pass the opportunity, provided by this Round of negotiations, to  liberalise world trade and establish equitable disciplines for  the new components of world trade. The recent NAM Summit

illustrated beyond doubt that this is a view shared equally by  developed and. developing countries.

The other ;important need in this conJ;:ext is for prompt and  effective follonÃ¢Â‘-up to the outcomes of the UN Conference on  Environment and Development, and in particular the creation oÂ£ an  effective Sustainable Development Coli'mission. We cannot waste  now the opportunity offered to us at Rio to make a serious attack  on the elimination of global poverty, based on the principles of  sustainable development. Ignoring these will produce, at best,  only short term solutions which will have little impact on our  ability to secure the future of this planet. This places a  particular onus on us at this Session. Our decisions and actions

7

will have a crucial bearing on how the concerns identified at R~o  are taken forward.

Natural disasters, acute poverty, famine and environmental  degradation ,are all, along with war itself, major contributors to  another g J:. e~t humanitarian problem (and by I e~tension security  problem) v.i th which the international system is barely coping -unregulated population flows. Much important relief and  rehabilitation work continues to be done for reÂ£ugees and  displaced persons by the relevant agencies, in particular the  UNHCR. And some useful attention has been recently given to the

problem by the General Assembly. But crises continue to  escalate, and there are still problems evident ~n the  coordination of responses between operating and  bodies. Those problems have to be addressed. as

supervising  a matter of

urgency, and one obvious way to do so is, again, to strengthen  the capacity of the new Department of Humanitarian Affairs.

There is at least one other non-military threat to peace and  security that Australia hopes will get increased attention from  this General Assembly, and thet is the failure of governments to  observe the fundamental standards of human rights as set out in

the Universal Declaration and the more detailed Covenants -to  which so many of us have subscribed.

The Secretary-General in his Report, An Agenda for Peace, very  properly emphasises in this context the question of t~e rights oÂ£  minorities. It is understandable that, freed from the iron  restraints of totalitarian regimes, some ethnic and linguistic J groups have sought - and no doubt will continue to seek - to  establish their Olrm political entities. As has been all too  graphically demonstrated in the states of former Yugoslavia, Traq  and elsewhere, there is no easy answer to these aspirations,  particularly when self-determination would in such cases be

synonymous with fragmentation and itself be a source of threat to  international peace and security. War, particularly civil war,  also engenders many of the greatest abuses of human rights.

8

'!'he bulk of such aspirations to self-determination might, in  fact, be met by stricter observance of human rights and  guarantees of the rights of all minorities - ethnic, religious,  linguistic or social - within democratic frameworks. The General  Assembly will have before it at this Session a Declaration on the

Rights of Minorities endorsed e~r'iier this year by the Commission  ' ' '

on Human Rights. And the launch, later this Session, of the  International Year of the World's Indigenous People - to which  Australia is very strongly committed will be a further  indication of our concern in this regard.

Breaches of universal human rights s~andards remain, unhappily,  all too common. In a country such as Burma the security of the  state is based on a denial of fundomental human rights and the  application of democratic processes. In South Africa, the  promise of a peaceful, negotiated transition to majority rule  continues to be put at risk by recurring violence of appalling  intensity, :i. tsel f an all too obvious legacy of the apartheid  system.

These, and too many other examples which could be mentioned, show . ' .  the dimensions of the problem still ahead of us. They confirm  the importance of next year's World Conference en Human Rights in  Vien..'!a, particularly for those governments needing further  encouragement to adopt human rights policies - founded not on so "

called Western values but on internationally accepted, universal  standards of practice. Discussion at this session shoUld play an  important role in developing a consensus approach to the  Conference. At the very least, I hope it will resolve the J  outstanding question of the Agenda which was left undecided at

the recent preparatory meeting in Geneva.

This General Assembly might also usefully consider some other  steps to consolidate respect for human rights. There is, for  instance, a growing call by the international community for a  mechanism to, try individuals for breaches of internatiopal  humanitarian law and other international crimes. Australia

supports consideration being given to an international criminal  jurisdiction to deal with such offences, and considers that the

9

International taw Co~mission should continue its important work  on this topic, specifically by drafting a statute for an  international criminal court.

Arms Control and Disarmament  ','

I ,

The end of the Cold War notwithstanding, a major preventive  effort is still necessary by the international community in  relation to the military threat to security posed by continuing  arms build-ups. The climate for such an effort is certainly now  encouraging. , International endeavours in this field are finaÃ¢Â‘lly  producing results. After over 20 years, agreement has finally  been reached on a Chemical Weapons Convention text. It is an  historic achievement, and one for which Australia has .,..Ã¢Â‘orked  particularly hard. ; Unanimous endorsement of this Convention,  with a recommendation for its universal signature and

ratification, would be one of the major outcomes of this 47th  Session of the General Assembly.

We should also build on the success we have had in concluding the

Convention to reinvigorate , our efforts to reach agreement on  other elements of the multilateral Ã¢Â‘disarmament agenda. The  benefits to mankind of the end of the Cold War will be quickly  lost unless progress made in bilateral arms control and  disarmament negotiations between the United States and the former  Soviet Union' is carried into the multilateral arms control  process.

We must re-double our efforts to achieve a world free from

nuclear weapons, and the threat of nuclear war. We must work  harder to obtain universal membership of the Nuclear Non " Proliferation Treaty and ensure its indefinite extension  unamended in 1995. vle should also conti>'LUe the progress that has  been made since the Gulf War to strengthen the IAEA nuclear  safeguards system and tighten export controls on nuclear and  nuclear-related dual-use items. We should build on the  moratorium on nuclear testing advanced by Russia and France. And

I urge r1ember States to support once again the Resolution

10

Australia will co-sponsor at this Session on the Comprehensive  Test Ba.n Treaty.

Increased transparency in military activities should continue to  be a key objective for all Members of the General Assembly. I ' .  reg'a:: :d the UN Register of COnventional Arms Transfers established  by UNGA 46 as an important step in this process. Australia  welcomes the Secretary-General's report on the operation of the  Register and s~pports its adoption.

At the recent Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta, leaders expressed  their deep concern over the negative i!ilpact of global military  expenditure, and their support for the attainment of security at  lower levels of armaments. We must all work to make good these  pledges, the~eby releasing sorely needed funds to help free the  p~oples of the world from want as well as from the fear of war

and destruction.

Preventive Diplomacy and Peace-Making

Pursuing an effective arms- control agenda, and addressing a  variety of non-military threats to security, are all important  ways of creating a general environment i~ which risks to security  are minimised. So too are the "peace-building" strategies  described in the Secretary-General's Report, many of which are as  much applicable to pre-conflict as to post-conflict situat~ons.  But the tools with the cutting edges in specific situations of  conflict prevention and avoidance of conflict escalation are  preventive diplomacy and peace-making.

In An Agenda for Peace the Secretary-General emphasised the  importance of preventive diplomacy as a cost-effective means of  avoiding the human and material costs of conflict and the burdens  involved in using armed force to reso1ve conflicts. Indeed, if  we examine the worst conflicts over the last twe1ve months - in  the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Afghanistan we could  plausibly argue that, at least in the first two cases, more  attention to preventive diplomacy may have avoided the  catastrophes that befell those nations and peoples. Australia

11

considers, therefore, that the challenge before the UN in the  coming year will be to establish more effective processes for  converting the promise of preventive diplomacy in all its aspects  into reality.

Effectiv~ ;reventive diplomacy cannot be ad hoc or peripheral to

the other activities of the UN. What is required is a  strengthened capacity within the UN to encourage and assi .st  parties to disputes to peacefully resolve their differences. T~e  crucial elements in making preventive diplomacy work are timing,  adequate resources and a willingness of t-1ember States to invest

the UN with the authority to use all the means available for its  effective imple. .. nentation.

In practice, the trigger for UN action, and the threshold for  defining a situation as a threat to inÃ¢Â‘ternational peace and  security, has tended to be the outbreak of armed hostilities.  The earliest possible attenticn to potentially significant  disputes is crucial if they are to be addressed before the

parties have become committed and entrapped by their own rhetoric  and actions.

This in turn calls for the formation of a permanent unit within  the Secretariat with an enhanced capacity t.o gather, receive and  analyse not only basic facts but information about the concerns  and interests of the parties to a dispute, in order better to  prepare reco~mendations on possible action. This requires a more  systematic approach to information-gathering and ana2.ysis, for  which a professionally dedicated support unit in the Secretariat

is essential. '

This will need in turn a sophisticated level of expertise and  skill in the form of a nucleus of foreign affairs specialists and  policy analysts experienced and knowledgeable in conflict  resolution: the ~kills which are necessary to encourage part~es  to a dispute to improve communication, minimise inflammation,  define issues, and create innovative and .imaginative ways oÂ£  reconciling their conflicting interests. Regular and routine

field visits should allow an improved capacity for fact-finding,

12

early-warning information gathering, and the opportunity to  quietly provide good offices. Staff should have the capacity to  develop in-depth knowledge of emerging disputes and to gain tte  confidence of all parties at an early stage. An evaluation

mechanism should be developed to collect, analyse and retain  experience from such activities which could prove useful in other  similar situations.

I therefore applaud the decisions Dr Boutrcs-Ghali has so fa:::: " taken to create geographically-based divisions within the  Department of Political Affairs whose tasks will include the  collection of inforrr.ation on various regions and the early

identification and analysis of possible conflicts, and I urge all  l"ie.mbers to support the Secretary-General in further efforts to  establish a professional and effective mechanism for preventi~.re  diplomacy.

There is also scope, in encouraging greater use of preventive  diplomacy, for more extensive training in the principles  underpinning the concept. It is good to hear, in this context,  that the UN Institute for 'Training and Research (UNITAR), is  planning to launch a new fellowship program in preventive  diplomacy in 1993. I think it will be important for relevant UN

Secretariat staff, and diplomats and officials from Member  States, to participate in this fellowship program. I am pleased  to announce today that Australia will contribute US$50,000  ($A69,000) to UNITAR to assist with the costs of the first year  of the fellowship. I would urge that other Member States also  consider a ,contribution, and participatipn by their officials.

A significant challenge to an enhanced Secretariat role in  preventive diplomacy will, of course, be the deep reluctance of  many states to accept any suggestion that a contentious bilateral  issue be internationalised. While there will no doubt continue  to be caution about too early resort to Articles 35 and 99 (which  enable Member States and the Secretary-General respectively to  bring disputes to the Security Council), there should not be the

same degree of reluctance to have regard to Article 33, which  requires parties to a dispute to first seek a solution by

13

negotiation, mediation or the like. What has been lacking  hitherto is any real institutional capacity within the UN system  to respond to such approaches or. other than a wholly ad hoc  basis. The building of such a capacity for quiet diplomacy in

the way I have been describing would be a major step fo~~ard, and  help over time to increase members' co:tfidence in other Ano~e /  formal UN processes.

* * *

I have today sought to give some substance, not just rhetorical  support, to the proposition that the changed conditions of the  post-Cold War world do call for neY~' responses from the United  Nations. The Secretary-General has shown us some new directions

'

in his Agenda for Peace. ~~at is needed now is action.

In nearly all cases no major new .international machinery is  called for or necessary, because the machinery is already there  in the Charter rusty, in some cases, but still serviceable.  What is needed, however, in virtually every case is the

lubrication of adequate financing, and re-structuring within the  UN system to meet the increasing demands being made on it. One

of the really fundamental tasks 'i'le need to move forward at this  Session is continuation of the process of UN reform.

There is no single, or simple, enemy to peace in the contemporary  world. The appalling situation in Somalia, and the looming  crises in Mozambique and Sudan, are demonstrations ~ if any are  needed - th?t problems do not come in neatly defined packages. . J

The Somalian situation involves, sim,.ll taneously, huma:r.i tar ian  assistance, peace-keeping and political negotiation, with no one  of these elements being capable of delivery in isolation. The UN  is now organising itself in Somalia to deliver these el~~ents i~  an integrated way, although it has been a difficult and  protracted process to get to this point. The task for the UN in  the future is to learn from this experience and devote the  ne.cessary resources to achieving the kind of coordination between  humanitarian and pOlitical strategies that is going to be

~ 14

1

T. increasingly necessary in the future if durable solutions are to

be found to many real world problems.

More and more attention is going to focus, as indeed it has  already in this General Debate, on the role and

representativeness of the Securit ~ ~ouncil itself. / As President  Suharto said last week, speaking in this respect on behalf of the  whole Non-Aligned i-1ove.ment, the post-Cold War world is not the  '1'7orld as it ,.;ras after World \'Jar 1 I. Our guiding light should

oont~nuo ~o bo ~hn prQ~Qn~ ~Qrm~ nf ~hP ~hRr~Ar. But it ~hQuld

be within our collective capacity to work out the changes in th~  composition and methods of decision of the Sesurity Council that  will ensure it can both fulfil its duty and command overwhelming  consensus for its decisions in the years ahead.

In many respects the task ahead of us, and ahead of the United  Nations, is daunting. It is clear that we are part of an  evolutionary process, with both the world and the UN adjusting to  new demands. ' We must draw strength from tha success achieved in  the last twelve months, and from the progress we have made in

improving global co-operation.

But our success has not been uniform we were not able to

respond adequately to some key challenges. We must never lose  sight of the goal ahead of us: a more stable and secure world,  devoid of abject poverty, with all peoples able tc- enjoy basic  rights and freedoms. And we must never avoid the responsibility  we all have to achieve those goals.
