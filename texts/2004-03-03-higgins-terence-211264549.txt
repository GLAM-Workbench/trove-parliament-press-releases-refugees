Item: ACT SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE TERENCE HIGGINS  SPEAKS ABOUT AUSTRALIA'S FIRST BILL OF RIGHTS.

COMPERE: Today at the National Press Club the Chief Justice  the ACT Supreme Court and Federal Court Judge,  Terence Higgins.

He'll discuss the National Capital's proposed Bill of  Human Rights, and canvasses implications for other  States and fears it will encourage so-called judicial  activism.

From Canberra, ACT Chief Justice, Terence  Higgins.

CHAIR: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today's National  Press Club Telstra Address, and welcome to our  guest, the Chief Justice of the ACT.

Terry Higgins is a local product in the law and in  many aspects of Canberra life including that of this  Club where he's been a regular attender [sic] and  supporter for a long time, and just referring back to  that introduction, the Act that was referred to is no  EPORT For private research and not to be disseminated.

longer proposed. It was in fact passed by the ACT  Legislative Assembly last night. So it's standing  out there more or less waiting for you, Your  Honour, and with many predictions about what it  might mean, and I'm sure they'll be some of the  things you're talking about today.

Please welcome the Chief Justice, Terry Higgins.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE TERENCE HIGGINS: Thank you very much, Ken.

I noted on the way in that there's a big crack in the  wall outside, I don't know whether that's a  consequence of the passage of the Human Rights  Act, but, there it is.

And as the Chairman rightly pointed out, at around  midnight last night the Legislative Assembly of the  Australian Capital Territory - this being the  smallest area of any judicial area within Australia

certainly, unless you count Norfolk Island - enacted  a legislative innovation that has the potential  fundamentally to alter the way we think about,  administer, and protect the fundamental human  rights of all people within our land. And I

emphasise 'all people'. It doesn't just apply to  citizens.

In time it may stand as an example for far wider,  even constitutional reform, in other Australian  jurisdictions. Now I refer of course to the Human

Rights Act 2004, which is Australia's first ever bill  of rights.

Now there has been much debate in the Assembly  over the inclusion of further kinds of rights. The  value of the ideals which were finally enshrined,  however, within the Act, is surely beyond

argument. They are substantially derived from the  International Covenant on Civil and Political  Rights, to which Australia is already a party.

Without taking any view - it would be premature to  do so - as to how they may be interpreted, they  include such rights as the right to peaceful  assembly, freedom of association, movement,  expression, thought, conscience, religion, and  belief.

Under the terms of the Bill - now the Act - those  who are arrested or detained will be required to be  brought promptly before a judge or a magistrate to  determine the legality of detention. Those in  custody will have the right to be treated with  humanity, and hndamentally, moreover, there will  be a recognition of the right of all people to enjoy

the equal protection of the law without

discrimination.

The right to a fair trial is enshrined, and the right to  have your case decided by a competent,

independent - and I stress that - and impartial court  or tribunal.

Now far from being universally welcomed  however, the protection of these rights through the  enactment of the Bill of Rights has proved a deeply  frightening prospect for many people.

In 1789, Jeremy Bentham described the French  Declaration of the Rights of Man as, and I quote,  'rhetorical nonsense. Nonsense upon stilts.' In that  eloquent and considered way, he had equated the  rights it espoused with a bastard brood of monsters.

'Gorgons and shimmerers dire', said he.

More recently the New South Wales Solicitor  General, Mr Michael Sexton, compared the ACT  Bill as it then was to a scientific experiment gone  wrong. I'm not sure what experiment he had in  mind, or indeed what science he had in mind.

And only two days ago, Mr Bill Stefaniak MLA  described it as, and  I quote, 'The most important  and dangerous legislation', end quote, the Assembly  has ever debated.

Well given that our Legislative Assembly have just  unleashed the ACT'S particular version of these  supposed monsters upon us, it is timely to ask  ourselves why, if the theory is so laudable, why are  we so alarmed at the prospect of encoding what we  already believe in.

There are many people who fear that a Bill of  Rights will effectively take the power to make laws

on controversial issues away from the legislature,  and place it instead in the hands of an unelected  elite, namely, the judiciary.

In interpreting what the broadly worded phrases  mean, the court is said to be taking on a role which  is essentially the stuff of politics, and therefore  beyond its proper role and power.

Now take for example the right to life, or free  speech. Where does one draw the line between free  speech and censorship? Or between the right to  life, and a woman's freedom to have an abortion?

Clearly many people believe it is an illegitimate use

of political power for the judiciary to presume to  make such decisions. Mr Sexton stated, 'the law  has no business in deciding issues that properly  belong to parliament'.

The judiciary, it is said, is there to interpret and  imply the law only; it is not there to make policy.  As such, if judges take excursions into the field of  political decision making, they are simultaneously  undermining democracy and compromising their

own independence by damaging the public's view  of judges as impartial and objective arbiters who  merely apply the law to the facts.

For the moment at least, we may safely say that  such fears are highly exaggerated. The way the

ACT Act is designed to operate makes it clear that I

it will not lead to any such transfer of political  power to the judiciary - and I'm thankful for that.

This is not a constitutional amendment. It's merely  an Act of the Assembly, and can be changed,  altered or abolished as the Assembly, or any future  Assembly, sees fit.

The Act does not attach rights immediately to every  person; instead it outlines the rights which the  Assembly should not legislate to override, and asks  the courts simply to, and I quote, 'ensure that all

Territory statutes are interpreted in a way that  respects and protects the humans rights set out in  the Act'.

It's a check on the legislature, not a free for all  source of individual rights,  so any feared avalanche  of litigation as a result of its enactment is hugely  overstated.

It has moreover a pre-emptive operation before the  courts are even involved. The Legislative  Assembly will scrutinise the human rights  implications of all proposed legislation before it  takes effect, by requiring the Attorney-General to

issue a compatibility statement with each Bill  presented to the Assembly. That is that the  proposed legislation is not inconsistent with the  Human Rights Act.

If a piece of legislation is then challenged in court,  the courts will either interpret its meaning, so as to  be consistent with the Human Rights Act, or if that  is not possible, it will issue a declaration of

incompatibility.

Now this declaration, it's important to note, does  not affect the rights of parties or the validity of the  subject legislation. The court simply does not have  the power to strike down the legislation. The

declaration goes to the Attorney-General who must  table it before the Assembly, and prepare a written  response - in other words, he gets his homework to  do.

But simply focusing on this Bill does not address  the wider issue. I am particularly concerned when I  hear repeated attacks on the Human Rights Act on  the ground that it is somehow undemocratic in its  operation. Such arguments, in my view, are  misguided, and display a shocking ignorance of  both the nature of judicial independence, and the  role of that independence in a liberal democracy.

The fundamental rationale for an independent  judiciary is to render individual justice to all people  according to law. In so doing, it provides the  crucial means by which rights may be enforced

independent of the political process.

It's founded on the understanding that there are  groups or individuals in society who may not have

political power, and who - some other group in  society - or even the majority of people through  their representatives may wish to oppress, but  whose rights must nevertheless be respected.

The voice of that majority is indeed no proof of  justice. As Professor Hilary Charlesworth has  noted, the major political parties in Australia  typically agree on the groups whose rights can be

conveniently, and indeed popularly, trampled upon.  The rights of asylum seekers and other non-  residents, prisoners in the criminal justice system,  terrorist suspects - whether or not they've actually  been charged with anything - are obvious examples

of that tendency today.

In the first against terrorism, truly draconian  legislation has been passed which allows anyone to  be detained on the mere suspicion held by the  Attorney General that such detention will, and I  quote, 'substantially assist the collection of  intelligence'.

It provides for no proper legal representation, and  takes away the right to be brought before a court,  and even the right to silence. And also attacks the  freedom of association by introducing guilt by  association if a particular group is declared illegal -  simply being a member of that group them becomes  a crime.

In our history, legislative abuses of human rights  have also been inflicted upon members of the  Communist Party and conscientious objectors -  some of whom I once had the pleasure of defending

in court against such majoritarian tyranny.

In the ACT right now, reference may be made to  the plight of the mentally ill who are being left to  languish in jail cells while on remand, because of  the lack of a secure mental health facility has left  magistrates and judges with no other choice

consistent with public safety.

As many people have said, this is a human rights  issue about which he courts can, at present, do  nothing.

It is the role of the judiciary to defend the rights of  these people to the fullest extent of the law, and  inform the legislature when it considers that those  rights have been breached. This is undemocratic

only if our understanding of democracy is limited  to brute majoritarianism  - as Justice Kirby

described it.

If we believe democracy to be little more than  might is right, or take the utilitarian perspective of  Benton, and believe that the majority's happiness is  worth the suffering of the few.

Any true commitment to rule by the people  however must surely mean rule by all people for all

people; with all people having the political and  social freedom and the equality necessary to  participate in, and live in that democracy in a  meaningful way.

An independent judiciary enforces these rights on  the basis there must be some things that even a  majority, through parliament must never be allowed  to do. Or, as I saw in Yes Minister, there are some  things even a minister ought not to know.

Because to do so, would constitute an attack on the  very people whose interests they supposedly  represent.

In my view this is not to be seen as undemocratic,  but as the operation of democracy properly  understood.

If this then is the rationalise for judicial

independence, it must be openly admitted that strict  and complete legalism as the only legitimate  justification for judicial power is dead. And it has  been killed by the sheer force of reality.

Nobody today could seriously make Montesquieu's  contention that judges are merely, and I quote him  'but the mouth which pronounces the words of the  law; such a view promotes the view of justice as  being merely bureaucratic and mechanical with no  thought for ideals, principles or consequences'; as  though judges just recite the law like human

ciphers, lacking emotions and beliefs about the  society in which they live.

Such a view as was denounced in 1972 as being  little more than 'a fairy tale in which we no longer  believe' - that was by Lord Reed*, which was, who  was cited by Justice Kirby. And to quote Justice

Michael Kirby, 'I respectfully agree with him that  it's amazing that generations of highly intelligent  people fell victims to this fiction and were able to  sell it to a na'ive community for so long'.

Not only is it unrealistic, it's also undesirable. If an  independent judiciary is to enforce the rights of all,  it must do so even in circumstances where it may  lead to politically inconvenient outcomes. This  simple fact has been recognised over decades of  national and international debate.

The fact that a particular issue may lead to political  controversy is a flimsy rationale for abdicating this  role, for it is in politically sensitive cases that the  rights of individuals are most frequently trampled  upon.

If the judges have some discretion in how to  interpret words or phrases, what of it, they've  always done so. If judges did not make decisions  with some consideration of the policy implications,  they'd be considered out of touch.

Consider a claim for medical negligence in which a  court must weigh up the considerations of an  awarding an appropriate sum of damages to an  aggrieved person, I guess the probable effect that  might have on medical indemnity insurance.

Consider a sentence in a criminal matter, in which  the need to protect the community is balanced  against the desirability of attempting to rehabilitate,  for instance, a drug dependent offender.

When people call for harsher sentencing of repeat  offenders, what is that if not an appeal for judges to  consider matters of policy.

So-called policy issues must occasionally have  some influence. These influences do not result in  the exercise of personal choice or the political  opinion

of the judge in question - as was so naively  and perhaps cynically claimed by critics of Justice  Michael Kirby's appeal to natural legal principle  recently.

This is the role the courts have always played, and  probably will always play. A bill of rights,  particularly a legislative bill, does not

fbndamentally alter that role. It merely expands the  repertoire of rights recognised which may thereby  be enforced.

If this was never a problem before, why should it be  a problem under the Human Rights Act? The only

difference is that such an Act gives more scope for  this function to restrict the actions of the legislature  on a wider variety of issues.

But what kind of argument is this? Are we to  seriously suggest that the legislature should be  given the power to deprive people of the right to  life; or to restrict freedoms of movement, or of  conscience as it sees fit?

True, these rights are not absolute, and they must be  balanced with competing considerations. But the  judiciary has undertaken such a role since its  creation, and if those rights are not protected at all,

surely this is a matter for concern.

The independent and impartial enforcement of  rights therefore are far from being a thing to fear, is  in itself the very mark of a secure and mature  democracy.

So what else is there in the argument against the  bill of rights? Some commentators feel it's drawing  a long bow to argue that the ACT requires human  rights protection.

In the federal arena the ex-Attorney-General Mr  Daryl Williams, has confidently asserted that he is,  to use his words, quote 'hard pressed to think of  anything that you'd want to protect in the bill of  rights that isn't already appropriately protected

under our legal system.

Now that's nothing short of an attempt, properly  analysed, to exploit the lack of knowledge which  abounds among the public as to exactly what the  constitutional and legal position is and which  allows such populist over-simplifications to gain  currency.

A cursory glance at how inadequately rights are  currently protected, apart from the Human Rights  Act, compels one to the view that more needs to be  done. For instance, the Commonwealth

constitution enshrines only a meagre smattering of  protections, such as the right to vote, Section 41;  trial by jury, Section 80; freedom of religion,  Section 116; and the acquisition of property on just  terms, Section 5 1.3 1.

These protections are not individual rights. They  only restrict the Commonwealth Parliament and  Government, not the State or Territory Parliaments  and Governments. They've typically been given a  very narrow meaning by the High Court. The free

exercise of religion for example does not

encompass any right to principles, conscientious  objection to military service.

Trial by jury is only required for indictable  offences. But although some judges had dissented  from this view in the past, the current position is  that this still allows the legislature to decide which  offences are indictable.

A Commonwealth law enabling Aboriginal children  to be forcibly taken from their homes and placed in  the care of a Government authority also, apparently,  did not constitute an attack on the free ability of

those children to practise their particular faith, a  decision which highlights the lack of status,  afforded Aboriginal spirituality as a religion in  mainstream thought.

In the past the High Court has recognised certain  rights as implied from the Constitution, including a  freedom of political communication. It has  recognised certain international legal norms may be

a legitimate and important influence on the  development  of our common law, particularly  where they related to human rights - so said the

court in the now famous Mabo decision.

Various legislatures have passe enactments  protecting various rights. In 1975 the

Commonwealth Parliament passed the Racial  Discrimination Act 1975 which gave effect to the  International Convention on the Elimination of all

Forms of Racial Discrimination, and passed the  Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  Act 1986 establishing a Commission to promote  and protect human rights.

But these measures, even taken together, provide  no protection of even some of the most basic  human rights. Political communication, for  example, is strictly limited to political discussion.

It does not protect any wider freedom of speech,  thought or communication. Any thought of a wider  suite of rights implied generally due to the nature of

our constitution has been roundly rejected.

Indeed if we look to history the drafters of the  constitution debated whether or not to include a bill

of rights, as was the case in the United States, but  rejected the idea and included instead a racial  provision specifically for the purpose of regulating  the affairs of and to quote Edmund Barton, 'the  people of coloured or inferior races'.

The legacy of that decision can be seen in the  Hindmarsh Island case in which the opinion of the  High Court was split on the issue of whether or not  this power allowed Parliament to make Nazi-style  race laws in 1998. It's ludicrous to suggest that our  system provides for anything like a comprehensive  system of rights protection. Fundamental rights  like a right to the equal protection of the law; the  right to peaceful assembly or freedom of

conscience, rights we all assume we have and take  largely for granted, simply do not exist in law.

I'd close with the following postscript. Mr Bob  Carr, the Premier of New South Wales and others  have argued that a bill of rights should not be  enacted even in statutory form because, to do so  would be an admission of failure. True rights  protection, he says, springs from the spirit of  respect to human rights that must lie with the

general public themselves and quoting Justice  Learned Hand, 'When it dies there, no constitution,  no law, no court can save it.' That sentiment is  joined by Ralph Waldo Emerson who said,

'Nothing is more disgusting than the crowing about  liberty by slaves and the flippant mistaken for  freedom of some paper preamble.' Well a weaker  and more paltry argument against the bill of rights  would be hard to come by.

The bill of rights is not something advanced as a  substitute for that spirit but rather as a vitally  important mechanism for instilling and reinforcing  that spirit even more among the people that it

serves to protect. It serves as a permanent reminder  that no matter how fully that spirit is imbued in the  hearts of the people, if it is not equally imbued in  the hearts of our legislators and administrators, then  the people must have a means of recourse.

However, taken by itself and removed of its  attempted criticism of the bill, the point is still an  important one. Now I'll leave you with this  thought. The very nature of our society and the  place of the judicial system within it is such that it  relies upon the support and acquiescence of those  people for whose benefit it exists.

The bottom line is that, whether or not we accept  this Human Rights Act as part of our law, in the  longer term will be and must be the choice of the  people of the Australian Capital Territory. It is

essentially a political ch 1 Th t's why it' so

welcome that our legislature with its democratic  mandate has taken the initiative in proceeding with  this bill.

However we approach the Act, whether we view it  as something to be afraid of or whether we take up  the challenge of human rights protection in the  spirit of our shared human values is something we  must each decide for ourselves. I would only say  that I hope, when forming our view of the subject,  we may all do so from a genuine position of  knowledge and understanding about what the  judiciary does and why, and we are healthily

sceptical of anyone who attempts to lull us into a  false sense of security while supporting legislative  moves to curtain our human rights in the name of  some false conception of democracy.

As Sir Harry Gibbs said, 'In a democracy every  citizen should have an understanding of the role of  the judiciary, the manner in which the courts  function and the history of the relationship between  the courts and other organs of government.' This is  particularly important because the independence

and authority of the judiciary upon which the  maintenance of a just and free society so largely  depends in the end has no more secure protection  than the strength of the judges themselves and the

support and confidence of the public.

Once that understanding is reached, I would  suggest, that far from running scared over how  much power we give to unelected judges under this  new Act, we should be far more concerned about  where our current political climate will take us  without it.

Thank you very much. [Applause]

Thank you Judge, and some of our members are  now going to exercise their right - at least in this  forum - to ask you some questions. The first one  today is Cynthia Banham.

Chief Justice, Cynthia Banham from The Sydney  Morning Herald. I have a two-part question.  Firstly, I wonder if you would comment on this -  and it struck me when you began your speech - you

said that the fears about the Bill of Rights

unleashing judicial activism were highly  exaggerated, but then you went on to basically talk  about the fact that judges take policy matters into  consideration in cases anyway. And then it struck  me that this is exactly the sort of judicial activism  that the Howard Government is, is currently, you

know, railing against, and I just, I wonder how you,  whether your position, there isn't some of conflict  in your position.

And secondly, I also wanted to ask you, if the  current, if the ACT'S Bill of Rights now existed at a  Commonwealth level; of the new anti-terrorism

legislation that exists - and I'm thinking of the  detention regime for people who just have  information or suspected to have information about  terrorist incidents, and the secrecy provisions and  the AS10 Act, I wonder what, what parts, what

aspects of these new laws contravene the new Bill  of Rights.

Thank you Cynthia. Well taking your first question  first, I think the point I was making was that there's  always been an element of innovation in judicial  decision making; and that's even amongst those  judges who describe themselves, or have described

themselves as following strict legalism.

There really is no such thing, and it was somewhat  of a myth at the time, and it remains a myth to  suggest that that is so.

But the important question is how that policy  consideration is taken into account, and how the  decision making process is then exercised. Judges  do not, as I pointed out, simply apply their own  political perspectives to a question under decision,

nor are they free to take account of anything that  might appeal to them as being worthwhile.

There is the doctrine of precedent; there are the  appellant courts, and they constrain very much  what an individual judge may do, say, or decide.

So in that sense there really is no conflict between  what's been described as activism and the taking  account of policy and the strict legalism.

Now, in relation to the other part of the question, as  to whether current legislation would contravene a  Human Rights Act if passed at the Commonwealth  level, I'd prefer to pass on that because it's

something that might come before the court and it  would be inappropriate for me to make a comment  on that particular piece of legislation.

Crispin Hull, freelance, Chief Justice. You said in  your speech that people really had nothing to fear  from this ACT Human Rights Act because it  doesn't provide for enforceable individual rights.

And then later in your speech you said that it would  be ludicrous to suggest that our system provides for  a comprehensive system of protection of human  rights.

That being the case, do you think that this new

ACT Human Rights Act goes far enough?

Well as to whether it goes far enough, I'd have to  defer to the legislature on that - that's a legislative  decision. There are bills of rights, or human rights  legislation in other places which do provide for

enforceable rights of action. It's a matter for the  legislature whether it things that's desirable or not,  but certainly in other places that is the case.

The rights that are guaranteed by this Act will, of  course, be enforceable in the sense that they will  inform the interpretation of any legislation that may  apply to an individual, which legislation, or indeed  the common law, which may provide an individual  right to that person, say to sue for damages.

So, for instance, if you were looking at a question  of whether a person had been wrongfully arrested  or forcefully imprisoned, then the rights that are  enshrined in the bill may enable a finding that the  person has been unlawfully imprisoned, and that  may in turn activate some other right - such as the  right to sue for damages for false imprisonment.

Roderick Campbell, The Canberra Times, Chief  Justice. I'm going to ask you to do a little bit of  crystal-ball gazing, I suppose. Based on, sort of an  informed opinion and what you know about what's  happened in other jurisdictions - do you expect that  the Bill of Rights is going to give the ACT

Supreme Court much business? What's, and what  sort of business could you envisage that would  include? For instance, perhaps a political head-on  clash between say draconian anti-terrorism laws  and a Bill of Rights.

Thank you Rod. What sort of business will it - well  I wouldn't be asking the Attorney General to  appoint another judge to take account of the  increased number of cases that are likely to result.

In the United Kingdom for instance, when the  Human Rights Act was there passed, there was the  same fear expressed that this would open the  floodgates to litigation. And the answer is,  although the Human Rights Act has been relevant  to a large number of cases, it certainly hasn't led to

a flood of litigation of itself.

And this Act, because it enshrines no individual  right to enforce the rights that are protected by the  Act, is unlikely in my view to do so. It will

probably come in for a mention in a large number  of cases, but this will be incidental to the cases we  are already likely to have.

I suspect that it will be a strand of argument that  will be used by many litigants, but probably  nothing that would, of itself, increase the business  of the court as such.

So far as the likelihood of it to drag the courts into  conflict with the, say the executive government, it  is true that the Act does provide for scrutiny of  subordinate legislation in executive acts by the  courts. But that is probably no different to the  scrutiny which may be undertaken anyway -  although it does expand the grounds upon which  that scrutiny may be undertaken.

Subordinate legislation is not protected, but  because the assembly retains the right should it  choose to do so to validate the acts of the executors

by legislation, then it might be seen that if the  legislator did not consider that a declaration of  invalidity of say an executive act was appropriate it  could of course take action to reverse that situation.

:HAIR: Question from Laurie Wilson.

2UESTION: Chief Justice, Laurie Wilson from the Nine

Network. I want to do what Rob did and ask you to  - if you like, gaze into the crystal ball. If you could  look 10 years down the track and say if we're  looking then back over that 10-year period at what  this Bill has achieved what do you think the key  pointers will be?

And at the risk of pointing you in one direction you  made specific reference to the rights of the mentally  ill, is one group in society where those rights seem  not to be well protected. It seems to me that is one,

if we go by the number of deaths for instance that  occur - it must be one, Could you expand to some  extent on your comments about how those rights  will be protected?

I'ERENCE HIGGINS: Thank you Laurie. Well it's always dangerous to  speculate I suppose and those that do so generally  prove wrong very quickly. I would think that one  effect of this Act will be that when we do your 10-

year retrospective, we'll probably find there's been a  great more discussion about human rights. We'll  probably find there's been a great more attention  given to what they really mean.

And while it's difficult to predict what the result of  that discussion or attention will be it's probably a  good thing to concentrate on what the rights of our  individual citizens are and what rights should be  protected and to what extent they should be

protected.

You mentioned the case of the mentally ill, and that  of course is particularly relevant in the case of  persons who are afflicted with mental illness,  because very frequently they are unable to protect

themselves. They're not the only group of course in  society that has that disability of being unable to  protect themselves, but nevertheless it's a clear  example of where a focus on their rights, and the  protection of them can only do good.

So I think we'll find that a great deal of scrutiny and  attention given to the rights, the Bill, the Act as it  now is, refers to. And I'm sure that will have a  beneficial effect because whilst I don't think any

legislator in this country specifically goes out to  deny human rights. I don't think legislators say to  themselves what human right can we destroy  today?

I think it's more an operation of other imperatives  overriding the protection foe rights being seen as  more important. Sometimes it's just a case of  oversight, where some process is put in place that  has the unintended effect of restricting the human  rights of the people to whom it applies.

So if that answers your question, seems to me that's  probably where we'll be in 10 years time.

Let's go back to Cynthia Banham.

Chief Justice, people from other states and  territories apart from the ACT might wonder upon  hearing about the ACT having this new Bill of  Rights. How are lives of ACT citizens now going  to be different to their own. And I wonder if you

can give a bit of a practical explanation or

examples of what the difference will now be  between the rights of citizens from the rest of  Australia to those in the ACT.

One would hope that the rights of persons in other  places would not be materially different, because it  is fair to say that the law generally does protect  human rights, albeit not in an organised and

specific way.

So hopehlly there would not be a great deal of  difference, because I suspect that even if the ACT  alone was to have the Human Rights Act and no  other place adopted it, decisions made in discussion  of those rights within the ACT would have an  effect in other states and territories. Whether it  leads them to also an active Human Right Act is  another question, but I think the focus on human  rights is the important issue.

We have seen over the years for instance in the  criminal law a number of protection's afforded to  persons who were accused, that previously were  being regarded as unnecessary. Just to give one

example, the right to - not to answer questions if  you are being interrogated. The right to have your -  the results of your interrogation if you submit to it,  put down in a form that's written or televised so that

it's free from any distortion or free from any  fabrication.

Well 30 years ago that would have been

unthinkable. But such rights needed to be  protected, but the High Court decided to do so and  we now have that protection. So I think the fact  that rights are set out in an organised way,

relatively comprehensively will be a usefbl example  to the other states and territories for discussion of  them that may well follow.

I think will provide guidance for them, not only in  terms of whether they wish to have an Act, but  whether they in the course of working out their  statutes and statutory and common law, have regard  to the interpretation that's given to it say in the  territory.

Crispin Hull.

It probably shows that the lack of interest in human  rights by the press that we're now doing a second  round. That's very unfortunate I think. I wonder if

I could ask you a practical question of how this will  operate in the courts. I could well imagine litigants  arguing for a particular interpretation of the statute.  But once they go beyond that, there's no joy in it for  them to argue that a statute is incompatible with  rights, so they're not going to put much energy into  that.

So will it be the case that after you've done your  interpreting of the statute you'll be, as a judge,  operating in a vacuum without benefit of argument  on both sides about the certificate of

incompatibility - sorry Declaration of

Incompatibility and then you'll be issuing that  declaration without benefit of argument?

Well first of all in deciding whether to make the  Declaration of Incompatibility the Act does require  that the Attorney General be notified of the  argument and give the right - and has the right to  put a counter-argument to those who are arguing

for a Declaration of Incompatibility. Whether or  not a declaration would advantage a particular  litigant in the proceedings is difficult to answer  because it may well not do so, as you point out.

On the other hand if the assembly is faced with a  Declaration of Incompatibility - particularly given  the dynamics of the ACT Legislative Assembly -  this could lead to the Assembly itself deciding to  give some relief to the litigant if any has been

disadvantaged by that incompatibility.

If we know the executive government of the  territory doesn't - and typically doesn't - have  complete control of what the legislator does, so  that's one avenue in which it might be of advantage

for someone to raise such an incompatibility. But  compatibly with the democratic principle that I've  mentioned the Act itself does not empower the  court to rectify that incompatibility.

If we can just go back to that mental health issue  because it's a popular one in Canberra at the  moment. You said that - after talking about the  plight of a number of the mentally ill before our

courts at the moment - you said that it was a human  rights issue about which the courts can at present  do nothing.

Is that a hint that you think that the court this might  now change? Is there the potential in this Act for  the courts to be more interventionists, or have more  of a say in how the mentally ill are treated?

TERENCE HIGGINS: I don't think the Act itself will provide that. The  issue for the mentally ill is and always has been up  till recently, not a question of not respecting the  rights of the mentally ill, but rather the resources to  be able to comfortably to deal with it. And that's

still a problem and will remain a problem even after  the passage of this Act.

But the Act itself may focus attention on that need  for resources - a need for resources which I'm sure

Laurie Wilson.

Laurie Wilson again, Chief Justice. As a non-  lawyer this may be a naive question but I just  wondering if you could tell us how you see the  influence of this Bill in the ACT spreading beyond  its borders around the country?

And I'm wondering whether or not, particularly - I  mean you mentioned Mr Sexton in New South  Wales - we have a degree of political hostility to  the idea. Whether indeed as for the judgements  made here are considered elsewhere whether or not

it might actually instigate a degree of judicial  activism elsewhere?

In a sense it might, depending on what you mean by  judicial activism. It would certainly result, I would  think, in discussion of human rights issues. And  what you're hinting at is I think this, that if the ACT

courts have before them, or before it because of  course the Supreme Court is the court which is  singled out by the Act as having this jurisdiction.

If the Supreme Court enters into a discussion of say  the right to freedom of movement that could well  influence other judges in other states and territories  to engage in a similar discussion. It's certainly the

case that a lot of the human rights decision-making,  in say New Zealand, Canada and the United  Kingdom, will be of great influence to the ACT  Supreme Court in deciding human rights issues.  And there's already a vast amount of juris prudence  in that area.

So I can foresee that that will be a significant  resource. As far as the ACT is concerned and that  resource will in turn will, if collected by ACT  judges, and commented upon by them would be of

influence I should think in other states and  territories.

CHAIR: Terence, I wonder if I could take you away from the

new Act a little while and look at some broader  issues. This broad question, or this broad fray of  judicial activism's been kicked around quite a lot in  the last couple of years.

We had quite a number of efforts last year to mark  the centenary of the High Court to make people  better understand how our judicial system works

and what the various elements of it are. And yet,  immediately proceeding it that we had some quite  vitriolic attacks on so called judicial activism from  high levels in politics.

What's your current interpretation of the perception  of the role of the courts, the appreciation of the rule  of law and the whole issues of perceptions  surrounding the sorts of things that led to the Bill of  Rights and the supporting criticism of it?

rERENCE HIGGINS: Well, first I should take judicial activism. It usually  is a criticism level by those who do not approve of  the decision which was just made. [Laughter]  Those who support it think it was - would think the  decision was entirely in accordance with principle.

[Laughter] But the fact is that the courts aren't  simply free, and judges aren't free to decide as they  choose.

If you look for instance at the Mabo case, which is  supposedly an example of judicial activism. The  only reason it is, is because the result was

unexpected. If you go through the reasoning in the  case, if you go through what the judges wrote, it  seems that it was inevitable and brought Australian  common law into line with common law elsewhere,  that the decision should have been made as it was.

Now was that judicial activism, when the  traditional methods of appeal to precedent,  applying current legal principle to a new fact  situation was undertaken. I wouldn't call that  judicial activism. What is likely to happen in

relation to the Bill of Rights and judicial activism,  is a little difficult to predict, but I doubt very much

whether any different sort of process would be  undertaken.

The Act does give the opportunity to apply human  rights law as it has been developed in say Canada,  New Zealand and UK, and to apply that juris  prudence to the Australian Capital Territory and to

any factual situation that might arise.

But it seems to me that the criticism of judicial  activism is misplaced, that a decision is either made  in accordance with the usual principles of legal  reasoning, or it's not. If it's not an appeal curt will  tell you so and correct your error.

Thank you very much. [Applause] Well it's turned  out to be another one of those masterpieces of  timing, so far as the Bill is proved last night, the  whole process was completed in time for you to be

able to talk about it as a done and deeds day.  Thank you very much for this very timely
