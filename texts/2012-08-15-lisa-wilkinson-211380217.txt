E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LISA WILKINSON:

Good morning to you, Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

G'day, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

Good to have you here. I know the Prime Minister is going to be here as well. We'll get to the politics of the  day in a moment but first up, an amazing fortnight for our athletes.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, an absolutely brilliant fortnight for the world. Very special for the athletes, their families, their  coaches, everyone involved, but great for Australia because we're a terrific sporting nation. There were some  disappointments but gee, there were some triumphs as well.

LISA WILKINSON:

Do you think we were too hard on them early on?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the short answer is yes. Every single athlete was doing his or her best and frankly that's enough, to do  as well as you humanly can.

LISA WILKINSON:

What were your highlights of the fortnight?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously Sally Pearson was extraordinary, particularly given that she carried the weight of the nation  on her shoulders. The women's swimming relay was great, Anna Meares outstanding. But, look, everyone  who had a go deserves our congratulation and our gratitude.

LISA WILKINSON:

You must have been watching things like the marathons with a particular sympathy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, but marathons for Olympians go much more quickly than marathons for amateurs!

LISA WILKINSON:

No, it has been a fantastic fortnight. Now, let's get to the news of the day. Living in tents on Nauru and  Manus Island, is that acceptable?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s very important that we have offshore processing. I'm thrilled that finally after four long and difficult  years with so much trauma, tragedy and cost, that the Government has finally adopted one of the three  essential elements in effective policies to stop the boats, but it is a big step in the right direction.

LISA WILKINSON:

Are you happy that those asylum seekers will be living in tents?

TONY ABBOTT:

If the Government had got cracking on Nauru at Christmas time as they should have, the centre would be  done by now and they wouldn't be living in tents but if initially people are living in tents, well, so be it.

LISA WILKINSON:

There is a question mark over whether it will be initially or very long term. How long would you be happy  for that to continue?

TONY ABBOTT:

The important thing is that we have rigorous offshore processing and people who arrive illegally by boat,  they have to be treated humanely, they can't expect five star treatment or even three star treatment.

LISA WILKINSON:

Fairfax is reporting this morning on a particular asylum seeker in West Java, Mohamad Khani. He says  living in a tent is no deterrent to him. He's coming anyway. Are we back to square one on this issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, because rigorous offshore processing at Nauru is one of the three essential elements in stopping the  boats. The others are temporary protection visas for people who are found to be refugees. They can go back

when the situation in their country improves. The other is the willingness to turn boats around where it's safe  to do so. Kevin Rudd said that the Labor Party would be prepared to do it. Unfortunately, that's one of the  many things they've squibbed over the last few years.

LISA WILKINSON:

So those last two are not part of what's going to go through Parliament by the looks of things today. So why  are you saying yes to something that you believe isn’t a whole process going forward?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s the compromise that we're prepared to offer the Government. We're prepared to support this,  even though it's only one of the three essential elements. But the point I keep making, Lisa, is if you want  John Howard's results, you've got to put in John Howard's policies and Nauru is one element, but it's only  one.

LISA WILKINSON:

But doesn’t that mean that you're saying yes to something but you're reserving the right to say, "See, we told  you so" if it doesn't work later on? If you're going to commit, you have to commit fully, don't you?

TONY ABBOTT:

But we’ve been saying all along, if you want to stop the boats you need Nauru, but not just Nauru. You need  temporary protection visas and you need the willingness to turn boats around where it's safe to do so.

LISA WILKINSON:

The humanitarian intake, looking to increase to 20,000. Are you happy with that?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s going to cost a lot of money and I think the chances of the Government achieving its surplus with all the  additional spending that it's loading us up with, including this, are becoming increasingly remote. We were  prepared to offer a modest increase as part of getting a deal but I would be very reluctant to support the big  increases that the Government is now flagging.

LISA WILKINSON:

Ok. Just to finish. A funny moment in Parliament yesterday when Malcolm Turnbull made a tribute to his  wife’s uncle, Robert Hughes. Let's take a look.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Finally we sprang him out of hospital and brought him home to recuperate with us for several months. It  was the year of the republican referendum and Bob first in a wheelchair and then in his callipers became a  prominent advocate for the yes vote. I think he had a swing at you Tony Abbott in one of those debates.

TONY ABBOTT:

He missed.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

He missed! What a loss to the nation it would have been if he'd connected.

LISA WILKINSON:

Come on. You two love each other.

TONY ABBOTT:

Malcolm and I go back a long way. We've been friends for 30 years now and it was a great debate, the  debate at Sydney Town Hall, where Robert Hughes was there on his crutches. I'm not sure that he literally  had a swing at me but orally, he certainly had a swing at me. I'm sure I gave as good as I got.

LISA WILKINSON:

I’m sure you did. Tony Abbott, we really appreciate you joining us this morning and enjoy the ceremony.  It's going to be a fantastic morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Terrific day for the athletes, their parents - how proud are the parents - and everyone involved with the  teams.

LISA WILKINSON:

Indeed. Thank you very much.
