TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP

INTERVIEW WITH TONY JONES

ABC LATELINE  23 FEB 2011

Subjects: National Broadband Network; Multiculturalism

……………………………………………………………………………

TONY JONES:

To discuss the Liberal Party’s policy on multiculturalism as well as the National Broadband  Network I was joined just a short time ago in our Parliament House studio by the  Opposition’s Communications spokesman, Malcolm Turnbull.

Malcolm Turnbull, thanks for joining us.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Great to be with you.

TONY JONES:

Why do Telstra’s high-speed wireless broadband plans threaten the NBN?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well the NBN’s business case, which is a very optimistic one and even on that optimistic  basis offers a very niggardly return to the taxpayer for the investment, assumes that wireless-only households will increase only fractionally from where they are today.

Now the experience internationally of course is that more and more households are moving to  be wireless only, and in the United States it’s in the 20, 25 per cent range, which is a lot  higher than it is here at the moment.

4G wireless is very high-speed wireless. It offers the speed of - faster speed than you can get  on fixed-line broadband today, so very fast broadband, and because of the convenience of  mobility, it’ll be a very compelling competitor.

So, it’s not wireless or fibre optics to the home, Tony, it’s not either/or, but it will occupy,  it’ll be a significant competitor to the NBN.

And, look, it’s not just me saying this. I mean, every brokers analyst that’s written about this  says the same thing: it will be significantly more competitive with the NBN than the NBN’s  management thinks, and that’s really the point.

TONY JONES:

The Minister, Stephen Conroy, says wireless is actually a complementary technology. Only  fibre connections can deliver the new services, like he says, in-home specialist healthcare and  rehab services?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, that’s nonsense. Absolute tripe. The reality is that broadband services, applications, if  you like, are delivered over a variety of platforms.

Stephen Conroy’s got this fixation about fibre-to-the-home. I’m completely baffled why he  has it. The Government’s policy should be completely technology agnostic.

You know, we all - ask yourself the same question: we all get access to broadband whether  it’s video or whether it’s web pages or whether it’s games or whatever you’re doing, you do it  over a variety of platforms - wireless, ADSL over copper, you might be connected to the  Foxtel cable over HFC cable, if you’ve got fibre optics to your home - some homes do have  it - or to your office more likely, you use that.

So there’s a variety of platforms. And this one-size-fits-all approach that the Government’s  taking is really so reckless and so unnecessarily extravagant.

TONY JONES:

Well, the NBN proponents say that wireless technology, even the super-speed variety, is still  limited by bandwidth, that it’s in fact basic physics you’re talking about here - the more  wireless users there are, the slower the network speeds, and that is the reason, the primary  reason why fibre is better?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, it’s a reason, but it seems to be lost on the global population. The internet is becoming  a wireless internet. I mean, this year, 2011, will be the year in which there are more wireless  internet-connected devices sold - that’s to say smartphones and tablets and iPhones and so  forth - than desktops and laptops.

If you take Apple, which is probably the leading technology company in this area in the  world, their revenues are three times as high from the sale of wireless-connected devices as  they are from the desktop variety.

So, again, it’s not either/or, and Conroy’s right to the extent that they are complementary.  Yes, they do overlap and many people will have used both fixed-line and wireless, but a lot  of people use wireless only.

And the only point - and this is really the only point we’re making - is that the Government’s  foolishness is to not live up to their own principles and policy.

They came into office, Tony, and they said, “We will not undertake any major infrastructure  project without doing a cost/benefit analysis,” which in this context means no more than this:  saying what is the most cost-effective way to ensure all Australians have access to fast  broadband?

Now if they did that analysis they would be able - they would get an answer which wouldn’t  involve fibre to every home to Australia. It would involve a mix of technologies, it would  save tens of billions of taxpayers’ dollars and it would get those people who don’t have good  broadband now, good broadband, fast broadband a lot sooner than they’ll get it under the  NBN.

TONY JONES:

Did it bother your conscience at all when some of your senior Coalition colleagues started  making a political issue out of the cost of the funerals of drowned asylum seekers?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, Tony, I think that’s all been dealt with. I think the - you know, Scott recognised that  his remarks had been ill-timed and he apologised for that and I think we’ve just got to  remember that the Coalition …

TONY JONES:

Ill-timed or ill-thought-out?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No, well, this is what he said, but I’m not going to run a commentary on Scott. He’s a very  good colleague and very good friend and he’s doing a good job.

TONY JONES:

OK.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Just say this to you: the Coalition is absolutely committed to a multicultural Australia, to a  non-discriminatory immigration program.

We believe that one of Australia’s greatest strengths is its cultural diversity. We are the most  successful immigrant country in the world. In my own electorate, in Wentworth, nearly a  third of the people in my electorate were not born in Australia.

We have achieved an extraordinary degree of harmonious integration of people from every  possible culture in the world. It’s a great achievement. We’re proud of it. We are committed  to a multicultural Australia - that is a reality. That’s part of our life.

TONY JONES:

So Liberal policy on multiculturalism will not change?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Absolutely not; it’s the same now as it always has been, or has been for many years, yeah.

TONY JONES:

Your colleague, Senator George Brandis, felt compelled to spring to the defence of  multiculturalism in the newspaper today, as you have tonight.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Yeah, and George was very eloquent too. He has a beautiful pen.

TONY JONES:

He said that attacks on Muslims reminded him of the sort of bullying that happened in the  schoolyard against other migrant groups when he was a kid. Does it remind you of the same  thing?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Look, I agree with George and I do remember - George and I are about the same age and we  remember the same phenomenon. Look, can I just say this to you: the - denigrating any  religion or any culture or any race is absolutely anathema and it’s un-Australian, it is

unhelpful - whatever problems there might be in terms of relations between people of  different backgrounds, that sort of denigratory talk, denigrating people from one faith  undermines that harmonious relationship. And so George was very strong about that and I am

too.

TONY JONES:

So was Senator Cory Bernardi, another of your colleagues, un-Australian and unhelpful when  he said, “I for one don’t want to eat meat butchered in the name of an ideology that is mired  in sixth century brutality and is anathema to my own values,” by which he means Islam?



MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, again, he’s apologised for his remarks. He’s free to eat whatever he likes, I suppose.  But the denigrating -

TONY JONES:

But is he free to say whatever he likes within the context that you were just talking about? I  mean, you said that that sort of commentary was un-Australian and unhelpful?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No, I’ve not made any comment about Senator Bernardi. But what I’m saying is people who  - whether it is people denigrating Christianity or Judaism or Islam or whether they’re  denigrating Greeks or Italians or Chinese, take your pick, denigrating people, religion,  denigrating people’s culture, denigrating their race is not the Australian way. It is not.

Because if it were, we could not be the extraordinarily successful and diverse culture that we  are.

Can I just say to you: the most successful cities and societies over history have been societies  that promoted multiculturalism. They didn’t have the word. But whether it is ancient  Alexandria or Constantinople or Smirna or even, or Rome or the United States itself,  diversity, recognising the strength that you draw from other cultures and when they meet  together and are bound together, Tony, by a commitment to a shared set of political values.

You see, that is the great thing about Australia: you do not define your Australian-ness by  having a particular complexion or a particular religion or a particular ethnic background. We  are defined as Australians because of our commitment to the shared political values of this  country, and that’s why our society is so inclusive.

TONY JONES:

It’s interesting to hear this and it makes one wonder if there’s a sort of battle going on right  now for the heart and the soul of the Coalition between conservatives on the one hand and  moderates like yourself, George Brandis on the other hand.

Because a lot of statements coming out of some of your senior colleagues seem to have come  straight from the One Nation playbook in recent days?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, look, I reject that. I think the views that I’ve expressed are held by the vast majority if  not all of my colleagues. I mean, I can’t speak for everyone, but I know the mood of the  members of the House and the members of the Senate on our side and there is a real  commitment and a recognition of the strength of the diversity of Australia.

But you see it’s a subtle thing. You know there used to be a time …

TONY JONES:

Is it a thing that’s in danger in some way?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No, I don’t think it is, but just let me finish. There’s a subtle thing. There was a time, you  know, a couple of generations ago when Australians saw themselves as being British, and so  the - if you came to Australia from another country, you were meant to sort of go into the  melting pot and come out of it British.

But we recognise now that our Australian-ness is part of that diversity. I mean, you’re a  Jones, I’m a Turnbull, but we share in a part of and in effect co-own all of the cultures that  make up our country. We share in the Chinese New Year, the lunar New Year festival. We

share in the Greek and Italian festivals. It is part of our way of life.

It is the richness, the diversity of this nation that makes us so strong and we must cherish it,  because it is precious and it is almost - not quite - but almost unique in the world.

TONY JONES:

I’ve got to just ask one final question and that is shouldn’t Tony Abbott be making these kind  of statements in defence of multiculturalism rather than the former leader of the Liberal  Party?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, I’m sure Tony shares my views or the views that I’ve expressed entirely. I don’t think  he’d dissent from any of it. But it’s up to him to - you know, he writes his own material and  he delivers it very eloquently when he does.

TONY JONES:

Malcolm Turnbull, we’ll have to leave you there. We thank you very much for coming on the  program tonight. Look forward to seeing you again.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Great to be with you.
