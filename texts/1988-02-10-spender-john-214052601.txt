RESUMPTION OF AID TO FIJI: A CASE OF TOO LITTLE TOO LATE

THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO RESUME BILATERAL AID WITH FIJI IS   A BELATED RECOGNITION THAT IT WAS WRONG TO CUT AID IN THE   FIRST PLACE, AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE GIVEN A HALF WELCOME.

BUT ONLY A HALF WELCOME. DESPITE FIJI'S GREAT IMPORTANCE TO   AUSTRALIA, AND THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THE WHOLE OF THE SOUTH   PACIFIC AREA TO AUSTRALIA, THE PACKAGE OF AID IS TO BE ONLY   $10 MILLION, AND NOTHING IS APPARENTLY TO BE DONE ABOUT AID

LOST DURING THE PERIOD OF SUSPENSION.

THE GOVERNMENT'S MEAN, UNWISE AND ERRATIC ADMINISTRATION OF   FOREIGN AID HAS COST AUSTRALIA INFLUENCE IN THE PLACE WHERE   INFLUENCE MOST MATTERS - OUR OWN REGION.

THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE UP FOR ALL AID LOST BY FIJI DURING   THE PERIOD OF SUSPENSION AND SHOULD RE-EXAMINE ITS AID   PRIORITIES.

NO ONE DISPUTES THERE IS GREAT SUFFERING IN AFRICA. BUT THERE   IS ALSO GREAT SUFFERING IN OUR OWN REGION - WITNESS THE PLIGHT   OF THE MANY REFUGEES FROM CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM - AND IT IS OUR   REGION WHICH SHOULD BE THE PRIME RECIPIENT OF AUSTRALIAN AID.
