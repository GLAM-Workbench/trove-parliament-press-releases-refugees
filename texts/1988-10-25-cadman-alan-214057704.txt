CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND IMMIGRATION

"'!'he expose by the F'our Corners Program of criminal activity  by triads within Australia confirms the public impression that  the Government's immigration program is out of control.

"l'he careless attitude of this Government'has threatened any .  acceptance of immigration and has seriously damaged the trust  Australians should have in the administration of immigration.

"Within the last few weeks there has been story after story of  immigration abuses, many of them raised Ã¢Â‘uy the Opposition -and there is more to come.

"Abuses of the refugee program, Business Migration Program,  failure to monitor criminal elements and a self-satisfied attitude  by successive Immigration Ministers has wrecked Australia's  immigz "a tion policies.

"Immigration must be controlled.  but it must also be controlled.  It must be fair and balanced  ~For years I have been constadtly alerting the Government to the

fact that Asian criminal elements have been establishing a base  in Australia. Ã¢Â‘

''The Chinese community in Australia is. a law-abiding c.onununi ty.  The Government's carelessness is threatening the high regard that  the Chinese community has est-ablished for itself,

"The Government stands condemned because it has no strategy for  coping with the countless abuses that are dally being presented  to the Australian people."  "The ignorant repl.ies !rom Ministers arc:

that there are inadequate safeguards, and that  in some cases the funds involved are the proceeds  o! illegal activities such as prostitution and  drugs"). To date there certainly has been no  evidence to substantiaLe ~ume o! the wild assertions

that have been made .... lt should be pointed out that  business migranLs are selected on the basis of their  successful business background.  " - Clyde Holding H  of R 30.8.88

'The Business MigraLion Program bas been the subject  of a series ot scurrilous attacks, o! allegations of  people coming ln and laundering money, and of being  a source o! criminal activity o! one sort or another ...  They are unsupported and unfounded. The only  conspiracy and criminal concepts that are involved

lurk deep within the mind oÂ£ Lhe honourable gentleman  (Ken Aldred).  " -Clyde Holding H o! R 28.9.88
