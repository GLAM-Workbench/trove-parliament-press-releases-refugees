INQUIRY INTO RETURN OF PREGNANT WOMAN TO CHINA

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced that an indepe ndent inquiry will be set up to 
thoroughly examine allegations surrounding the treatment of a PRC national 
following her return to China.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the decision was taken in light of 
the serious allegations that this woman may have been forced to undergo 
an abortion on her return under the PRC’s ‘One Child Policy’.

Â

“The Government takes these claims very seriously 
and is determined to see a thorough and authoritative investigation 
of these matters.

Â

“I have today agreed that Mr David Sadleir will 
be asked to undertake the inquiry, which will examine the allegations 
made, the circumstances surrounding the removal of this woman and her 
treatment on return to China.

Â

“The Inquiry will also make recommendations on any 
changes necessary to the management of such cases.

Â

“Mr Sadleir has impeccable credentials for the job, 
having served as a former Ambassador to China, and former head of ASI0. 
He is currently a member of the Australia China Council and is an adviser 
to the AMP on China.

Â

“Following the disclosure of the woman’s name 
in the media some days ago, Australia has moved quickly to initiate 
inquiries in the PRC regarding this case. The allegations which have 
been raised have obvious and significant human rights implications”.

Â

Mr Ruddock said it would be inappropriate to comment 
further on the case now that an inquiry has been announced.

Â

“Let me make it clear, however, that no person who 
claims refugee status in this country is returned unless their claims 
have been thoroughly examined and they have been found not to be refugees.

Â

“It has also never been Government policy to return 
unauthorised arrivals whose health would preclude them from travelling 
safely”.

STATEMENT OF FACTS IN THE CASE AS KNOWN 
BY DIMA

Â

The facts as they app ear from DIMA's examination of relevant 
files identified to date is as follows:

Â

There was a PRC woman removed in July 1997 who returned 
to China.

Â

She is Ms Zhu Qing Ping, as identified in the media. 
At the point of removal she was 35-36 weeks pregnant. The day before 
her departure she underwent a medical examination and was found to be 
in good health for travel.

Â

Following her arrival in Australia in late 1994 she 
had applied for a protection visa and had been found not to be a refugee. 
She had then sought a review of that decision before the Refugee Review 
Tribunal, which also found that she was not a refugee. She was represented 
by Legal Aid WA. She did not seek judicial review of the Refugee Review 
Tribunal decision.

Â

The Migration Act requires that an unlawful non-citizen 
who has no visa application before the Department must be removed from 
Australia. As it had been determined that there were no protection obligations 
owed to Ms Zhu, the Department was obliged to arrange her removal.

Â

It appears from media reporting that Ms Zhu underwent 
a medical procedure shortly after her return.

Â

The circumstances and details surrounding those matters are yet to 
be clarified, and will now be the subject to the Inquiry.

Â

A copy of a videotape of an interview with Ms  Zhu, a transcript 
of that interview and copies of some related documents have been provided 
to the Department.

Â

The Department has sought a further translation of 
all relevant material provide to it.
