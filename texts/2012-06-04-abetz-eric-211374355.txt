More Waste and Dysfunctional Government  Exposed in Senate Estimates

Wasteful spending and dysfunctional Government were the hallmarks of last  fortnights Senate Budget Estimates hearings.

From the millions taxpayers are paying for the Carbon Tax advertising campaign that  doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mention the Carbon Tax, to a shortfall of virtual hospital beds that were  never there in the first place, LaborÃ¢ÂÂs waste, mismanagement and bungling has  reached farcical proportions.

Here are just a few examples, in case you missed them.

Don’t mention the Carbon Tax

The Department of Finance confirmed that specially commissioned market research  warned the government not to mention the Carbon Tax in its new $36 million  advertising campaign.

Instead, they were told to keep it simple and focus on the handouts.

The new $36 million campaign brings total government spending on promoting the  Carbon Tax to close to $70 million.

Probing in Senate Estimates also revealed that the Department of Prime Minister  and Cabinet has been chairing a top-level working group to help the Government sell  the tax.

In typical Labor overkill, other agencies on the working group included the ATO and  the departments of Finance, Climate Change, Families, and Human Services.  The  Group meets for hours at a time and viewed the TV commercials about 5 -7 days  before they were aired.

Media inquiry a stich up

The Terms of Reference and key personnel for LaborÃ¢ÂÂs controversial media inquiry,  which recommended a new Council to oversee all news media organisations, were  set by five senior Cabinet Ministers.

Unusually, Ministers signed off on the decision without a Cabinet Submission and  without obtaining formal departmental advice.

The Inquiry, chaired by former judge Ray Finkelstein, called for statutory regulation  of both print and online media, a view that has been widely criticised as threatening  media independence.

Further evidence of the stitch up came with Senator ConroyÃ¢ÂÂs admission about his  “strong relationship” with Dr Matthew Ricketson, the inquiryÃ¢ÂÂs top adviser.

Departmental officials revealed that Mr Finkelstein was paid $4,400 per day and Dr  Ricketson $2,500 per day for their 70 days of work.

NBN Co misses targets as costs increase

LaborÃ¢ÂÂs $50 billion national broadband network continues to miss its own deadlines  and not reach the financial targets set out in its business case.

To date the NBN has passed approximately 19,900 premises and claims to have  11,000 Ã¢ÂÂactiveÃ¢ÂÂ connections of which 7,300 are on satellite and approximately 3,700  are on fibre.

Worryingly, this means that the connection rate for fibre connections (i.e. those  actually paying to use the NBN) is only 18.6 per cent. The connection rate for  100mbps fibre connections is approximately 9 per cent.

Average revenue per user was $29.55 compared with $37 in the NBNÃ¢ÂÂs 2010  corporate plan.

In Tasmania, touted by the Government to the rest of the nation as an example of  the NBNÃ¢ÂÂs benefits, only ten customers a month were signed up in the first three  months of this year.

Estimates also revealed that 55 NBN staff travelled overseas this financial year  despite the fact that NBN has no international operations. Someone should teach  them how to use Skype.

And amazingly, on average each NBN employee has spent more than $800 on taxi  and train fares so far this financial year.











Asylum seeker budget faces blow out

Officials from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship revealed that the  Departments budget is based on estimates that about 450 asylum seekers will arrive  each month.

Given that the boats keep coming and that in April alone there were 947 boat  arrivals, asylum seeker costs look set to blow out again.

Since Labor abolished the Howard GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs proven border protection  measures the cost to taxpayers of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs border protection failures has blown out  by $4.7 billion.

There are now more than 7,000 asylum seekers in detention or in the community,  and new boats keep arriving each month.

Pontville Detention Centre still on standby

Plans to close the Pontville Detention Centre near Hobart have been shelved.

Pontville was originally established as a short-term 6 month fix to deal with the flood  of asylum seekers entering Australia because of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs failed asylum seeker policy.

So far more than $50 million has been spent on the Detention Centre, and those  costs continue to rise as Serco staff continues to maintain a presence and the  floodlights burn brightly each night. This is despite the fact that the last detainee left  Pontville more than three months ago.



Councils to pay Carbon Tax

Waste deposited from 1 July 2012 will incur a Carbon Tax for at least 40 years.    The Clean Energy Regulator expects around 70 local councils have Carbon Tax  liabilities for their landfill operations.

One of the Councils expecting to be liable is the City of Wyndham in the Prime  MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs own electorate.  It plans to charge $13 million in Carbon Tax fees in 2012-13.

Once such waste has been in the ground for 12 months it is deemed to have begun  to decompose at a sufficient rate to attract the Carbon Tax.  The charge continues  for decades to come and ratepayers will be liable to pay the bill.

Labor trashes Defence personnel leave entitlements

As part of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Budget cuts - which take Defence spending as a share of GDP to  its lowest levels since 1938 - 22,000 single members of the Defence Force aged  over 21 will lose their recreational leave travel entitlements.

When they joined up they were told that when posted interstate they would be able  to go home a couple times a year at the ADFÃ¢ÂÂs expense.  Now Labor has unilaterally  abolished that right - a move that would have caused mayhem in a unionised  workplace.

The Budget saving is reportedly $15 million - or about six cents in every $10  Defence spends.

The move is short-sighted - especially given that highly trained Defence personnel  are continually being lost to jobs in the mining sector in WA and QLD.



Most Australians do it for free, but the Government spends $3,000 a week

The Government is spending $53,000 over 15 weeks on two blogs designed to  engage with the public in an “online conversation”.  On one blog just one reader has  left a comment and the other doesnÃ¢ÂÂt even allow comments to be made.   While the  Government spends more than $3,000 a week on these two, many thousands of  Australians use the free blogs readily available on the Internet.



FWA rejects Craig Thomson’s claims

Evidence provided by Fair Work Australia to Senate estimates blew massive holes in  Craig ThomsonÃ¢ÂÂs hour-long defence of his conduct in the House of Representatives.  Mr Thomson claimed that he had been set up with Ã¢ÂÂhookersÃ¢ÂÂ by his enemies.  FWA  revealed that the first they heard of this claim was on 2 March 2012, 79 days after  FWA sent its draft findings to Mr Thomson….3 years after FWA and its predecessor  commenced their inquiries.

Mr Thomson told Parliament that FWA had not investigated his theory that his phone  may have been hijacked.  FWA told Estimates he had never raised this issue with  them.

Mr Thomson claimed he had written to FWA last year alleging the person conducting  the investigation was biased. FWA said no such letter was received last year.

Mr Thomson alleged that Senior Deputy President Lawler had interfered in FWAÃ¢ÂÂs  investigation.  FWA said there was no evidence whatsoever to support this  allegation.

And so the Craig Thomson scandal goes on and on.









More Money for Nothing

It was revealed through Senate Estimates that the SchoolKids Bonus will be payable  even if children only attend one day of school per year.

Part-payments will be made automatically to parents before the school year starts  and while children will be required to be enrolled in school and attend at least one  day in each six-month period to receive the payment, the Government will have no  way of checking to see if children attend school regularly, or that the bonus is spent  on education expenses.

It was also revealed that the SchoolKids Bonus will be payable to parents who have  had their welfare payments suspended for not sending their children to school.



The Hospital beds which aren’t really hospital beds which aren’t really there

The Health Department conceded that the 1300 promised new hospital beds were  not really hospital beds but “bed equivalents” and no one was really clear what that  meant.

The Department also conceded that delivery of these “bed equivalents” was behind  schedule and that 25 per cent less funding than was agreed has been provided  because the Commonwealth couldnÃ¢ÂÂt determine the definition of a “bed equivalent”  with the States.

In brief

The office of the Chief Scientist spent $369,579 on moving to a new location in  2010, only to be moved back to the original location again in 2011.



The Budget allocated $20 million to restoration work at MelbourneÃ¢ÂÂs Royal  Exhibition Building but officials could not tell Estimates that any applications had  been received for the work to be done. Looks like another special deal for Greens  MP, Adam Bandt in whose electorate the building happens to be.



The Government will spend $1.2 million replacing NBN equipment already  installed in 700 Tasmanians premises because it is incompatible with Telstra  equipment.

More than 100 illegal weapons imported through the Sylvania Waters Post Office  went undetected by the Australian Customs and Border Protection ServiceÃ¢ÂÂs X-ray machine.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs not surprising - due to budgetary cuts only 8.3 per cent of air  cargo consignments are inspected.

It was revealed during estimates that none of the Federal GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs $215m  funding for Holden, announced on 22 March 2012, will be going to the engine  plant in Victoria.

Despite being included in the budget, no-one was asked or consulted about  LaborÃ¢ÂÂs announcement to create a $30m Manufacturing Technology Innovation  Centre and the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs Manufacturing Taskforce didnÃ¢ÂÂt discuss it until 25  May 15 days after the budget.



Following on from the new Carbon Tax advertising campaign that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt even  mention the Carbon Tax … the DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs Industry Update Unit has never  looked at the impact of the Carbon Tax on industry.

The DLA Piper review into sexual harassment complaints within the Defence  Force has so far cost taxpayers nearly $10 million.

The Australian Research Council thinks that having almost 100 new members out  of 140 members of its expert committee is not a big turn-over.

Labor has still only delivered 4 out of the promised 38 indigenous children and  family centres that were specifically promised by Kevin Rudd in his "Sorry"  speech in February 2008.

Teachers wanting to qualify for LaborÃ¢ÂÂs ‘National Rewards for Great Teachers  program’, will have to pay $1500 out of their own pocket as an application fee to  be assessed and to be eligible for a pay rise.

A multi-million dollar contract for a GP Super Clinic in Queensland was won by a  company with strong links to the Labor party. Paul Keating is its international  chairman and former Labor Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner is its "special  advisor".



Five years after the “digital education revolution” promised by Kevin Rudd, only 8  out of over 2650 secondary schools have actually been connected to high speed  fibre as promised.
