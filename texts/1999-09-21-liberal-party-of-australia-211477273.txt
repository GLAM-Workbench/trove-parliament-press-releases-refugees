ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR TIMOR

Â

Â

The Australian Government will provide additional funding of $4 million 
to assist the many hundreds of  thousands of people in both West 
and East Timor who have been displaced or affected by the recent violence.

Â

The Government continues to be extremely concerned 
about the condition and fate of displaced people in East and West Timor. 
We are working quickly to deliver emergency relief, protection and support. 
An improvement in the security situation across East Timor following 
the deployment of INTERFET will enable aid. agencies to provide urgently-needed 
assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people.

Â

This additional funding will be used to transport 
emergency relief supplies to East Timor, including through the use of 
ADF and commercial charter aircraft and shipping. It will also assist 
non-government organisations that are working to help people displaced 
by the conflict.

Â

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
will receive $500,000 to assist its work in providing protection for 
displaced people and the reunification of families in both East and 
West Timor.

Â

Australian non-government organisations such as CARE 
Australia, Community Aid Abroad/Oxfam, Australian Red Cross and World 
Vision will each receive $250,000 to support their work in delivering 
rapid and effective emergency relief to. displaced people in East and 
West Timor.

Â

Australia, through its overseas aid agency, AusAID, 
is working closely with the United Nations Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other agencies such as the World 
Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR) in supporting the relief operation.

Â

This contribution is in addition to the extensive 
work that Australia is already undertaking to support humanitarian relief 
activities for the people of East Timor, including the purchase of emergency 
supplies such as food and shelter materials, assisting the work of United 
Nations relief agencies, and setting up a large-scale logistical operation 
in Darwin.
