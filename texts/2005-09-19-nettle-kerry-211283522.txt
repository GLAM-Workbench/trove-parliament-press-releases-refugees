Baxter reforms still leave detainees in limbo

19th Sep 2005

Greens Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Kerry Nettle, today indicated  that the key reform the Baxter detention centre needed was to have the  gates opened.

"The most serious damage detainees suffer in immigration detention is not  knowing when or if they will get out. Indefinite loss of liberty is the main  problem for detainees, not a lack of hockey fields," Senator Nettle said.

"The Palmer inquiry did not have the capacity to question the policy of  mandatory detention of asylum seekers and as a result the  recommendations amount to little more than beautifying the cage, whilst  detainees are driven mad inside.

"Incidents of self harm, hunger strikes and suicide attempts will continue  whilst this government maintains a policy of indefinite mandatory detention  of asylum seekers. A new lunch menu wonâ€™t end the pain of prolonged  detention.

"The massive cost of establishing and maintaining desert prisons like Baxter  is insulting to taxpayers who are footing the bill for this cruel and  unnecessary policy.

"The Greens policy is to scrap mandatory detention of asylum seekers and  instead support asylum seekers to live in the community whilst their claims  for asylum are assessed."
