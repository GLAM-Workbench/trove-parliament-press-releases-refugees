TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW GREENE   ABC NEWS BREAKFAST

20 JULY 2013



E&OE

Subjects: Asylum seeker policy, fringe benefits tax, election

ANDREW GREENE:          Minister Kim Carr thank you for joining us on ABC News  Breakfast.

KIM CARR:                           Good morning.

ANDREW GREENE:          Firstly, we’ll move to the Fringe Benefits Tax changes  shortly, but if I can just stick with the asylum seeker policy  that was announced yesterday, already we are seeing  some grumblings from members of the Labor left about  this announcement, specifically the State President in  your state, Cath Bowtell. What do you say to people who  are a little bit uneasy with what has been announced by  the Prime Minister?

KIM CARR:                           Well this is a well-calibrated, carefully considered, and  diplomatically well-balanced approach to keeping people  alive.

This is about stopping people getting on very, very  dangerous boats and possibly drowning. This is about  ensuring the human rights of people to be able to live.

And for those reasons this is a measure I think that meets  the needs of the time, and is able to respond entirely  appropriately to what is a major public policy issue.

ANDREW GREENE:          Given it is such a departure to what many in your party  have advocated in the past, is it appropriate that it be  discussed when Kevin Rudd gathers the caucus in  Sydney on Monday?

KIM CARR:                           Oh invariably it will be, but it is a policy that is right for

the circumstances.

What we have here is a major question that concerns a  great many Australians and concerns a great many  people throughout the region, and it is a matter that  requires a regional response. And that is the direction the  Labor Government has taken.

What the Prime Minister has been able to do through his  extraordinary diplomatic skills is be able to develop a  highly effective means of sending signals to people  throughout this region that the current arrangements with  people smugglers sending many tens of thousands of  people on these perilous journeys has got to stop.

ANDREW GREENE:          Has anyone in your party expressed any concerns to you  about this?

KIM CARR:                           No, what people have expressed concerns about is  ensuring that we have an effective -

ANDREW GREENE:          So no one, no one at all, has sounded you out with any  concerns?

KIM CARR:                           Not to me about this announcement. What we have had  is people saying this a good response for the times, and  for ensuring that we keep people alive.

ANDREW GREENE:          If we can move to the announcements on Fringe Benefits  Tax, in an interview that will be airing shortly with another  company, Selectus, which is based in Melbourne, the  CEO there says that he has had to tell staff, his 200  strong workforce, that 100 people will go under these  changes. What can you say to the industry, which is  complaining of great uncertainty as a result of the  Government’s changes to Fringe Benefits Tax?

KIM CARR:                           Well I don’t want to see anyone lose their job. But I do

think some of these announcements seem to jump the  gun a little bit.

It would seem to me that this is an arrangement that has  been put in place a long time ago, and is no longer  meeting the circumstances for which it was originally  intended. It was intended to encourage people to buy  Australian motorcars.

What we’re seeing is increasing numbers of people using  the taxation system to get taxpayers to fund the private  use of motor vehicles, and they are often imported motor  vehicles. So my concern is to ensure that we do all that  we can to keep jobs in Australia, and particularly jobs in  the Australian automotive industry for people who are  making Australian made cars.

ANDREW GREENE:          Minister wasn’t it the Government that was in fact  jumping the gun by blindsiding industry with this  announcement with no consultation, and leaving many in  a position where their business model is now destroyed?

KIM CARR:                           Well the reality is there are some taxation questions  you just can’t consult about.

This is a matter that governments have to make decisions  on, and that’s what we’ve done. We’ve brought fairness  back into the taxation system.

We simply can’t have a circumstance where people use  the taxation system to fund their private consumption, in  terms of their use of the company car for private  purposes.

See this is not about stopping people using the tax  system for business purposes. It’s not about stopping  people buying motorcars.

People will still buy motorcars. You won’t suddenly find a  whole lot of people riding to work on a pushbike. What  you will see is people having to consider whether or not it  is appropriate to claim this as a tax deduction - if they do  have a business expense, it’s entirely legitimate, entirely  proper.

This doesn’t go to the taxis. It doesn’t go to the fleet  purchases for hire cars. It doesn’t go to people using their  vehicle for business purposes - and that’s an entirely  legitimate function of the taxation system.

The issue here is, should you be able to use the tax  system to subsidise the purchase of your petrol for an  imported motorcar?

ANDREW GREENE:          You spoke to the South Australian Premier yesterday,  who, as a Labor Premier, has expressed a lot of concerns  about what the Government is doing here. What were you  able to tell him in your meeting?

KIM CARR:                           Well that we’re always in the business of talking to  people about ways in which we administer government  programs.

And I’ve asked the Premier of South Australia to come  back with specific proposals.

I’m also saying to the auto industry more generally, if  there are issues that you want to raise with Government  come to us with the facts.

We want a facts-based conversation, not an emotive  conversation.

We want a facts-based conversation, so we’re very  interested in looking at the assessments Toyota and  Holden and other component manufacturers in the  automotive industry have put to us.

We’re very concerned to ensure that there is a proper  verification process to ensure that we are getting the  direction of the manufacturing industry policy right.

ANDREW GREENE:          Can you accept that there will be job losses under your  announcement?

KIM CARR:                           Well what we might also see is that people will switch  the way they fund their purchases of motorcars.

We won’t see people stop buying cars. That’s got to be  understood.

This is a policy that ‘s aimed at bringing fairness into the  taxation system.

Now if there are measures that need to be taken that can  improve the number of vehicles that are sold in Australia,  well, we’re prepared to look at that, as we always have  been.

We are in the business of insuring that Australia has a  strong automotive industry.

The only threat to the Australian automotive industry is  the Liberal Party. They are proposing to take out $500  million immediately and bring an end - bring an end - to  industry assistance, by referring future assistance to the  Productivity Commission. Now we know that is code for  bringing an end to assistance. Their policy is to return to  John Howard's policy-

ANDREW GREENE:          Minister on that point are you happy to face the election  against the Liberal Party who are promising to keep the  Fringe Benefits Tax arrangements while you are  promising to scrap them?

KIM CARR:                           Yes, and what’s more I look forward to seeing how the  Liberal Party is going to replace the $1.8 billion in  revenue. What else are they going to cut to fund the  private use of motor vehicles?

You have got to ask yourself this question - where does  the money come from?

There is a legitimate issue that people have put to us and  we are entitled to put it to the Liberal Party as well. If you

want to get rid of this measure, what are you going to  replace it with? Where are you going to find the $1.8  billion this measure brings in to the Government?

ANDREW GREENE:          And Minister just finally with asylum seekers dealt with in  a policy sense, and carbon pricing, surely we must be  seeing an announcement soon of an election date? Are  you getting ready for it?

KIM CARR:                           I wouldn't make any assumptions of that type.

We’re in the business of getting on with the job. We're in  the business of making sure we've got good government.  We’re in the business of doing things properly. We’re in  the business of ensuring that we solve problems. We are  not in the business are of just organising ourselves to the  benefit of newspaper speculation about election timing.

These are serious questions, serious issues. This is a  serious government answering those questions.

ANDREW GREENE:          Minister Carr thanks for your time.

KIM CARR:                           Thank you.
