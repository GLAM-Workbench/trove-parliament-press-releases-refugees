MOORE:                    Treasurer, many thanks for being there tonight for Lateline.

TREASURER:           Good to be with you, Ali.

MOORE:                    I understand you've met with the Governor of the Bank of  England, Mervyn King, in the past few hours.  Of course, just last week he had a very  downbeat assessment of the situation the world is facing.  He said it could be

confronting its worst ever financial crisis.  Was he more upbeat in his meeting with  you?

TREASURER:            Well, Ali, I don't comment on the private meetings that I have  with either finance ministers or central bank governors, but I believe there is a serious  situation in the global economy.    Two of our very big economic engines are misfiring, in both Europe and the United  States.  There's been a very big hit to global economic confidence that is reverberating  around the world.  We can see the impact on stock markets.

So there is a serious situation and that's why ministers over the weekend in Paris  concentrated in particular on the problem that we've got with Europe, the European  sovereign debt crisis. And we said to the European ministers that the time for half

measures and blame-shifting was over.  What we needed to see from European  leaders was a comprehensive plan to deal with the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.

MOORE:                    What did you say exactly?  Because the report, in fact the  reports in Australia this morning include the headline ‘Swan berates EU over slow  debt crisis action’.  How exactly did those conversations go?

TREASURER:            Well, this challenge has been going on for 18 months.  It first  erupted in May last year.  So I think there has been a frustration amongst global  finance ministers, particularly in the G20 and particularly outside of Europe that this

has not been dealt with with the speed that it required.

I'm confident now, as a result of these meetings both in Washington two weeks ago  and in Paris over the weekend, that European ministers are responding with the  urgency that is required, and that we need to see and hopefully will see from  European leaders this weekend a comprehensive response, which markets will judge  as being appropriate, which deals in a credible way with the recapitalisation of banks,  that deals with the issue of Greece and deals with the financial stability facility.  All  of those things are required from European leaders this coming weekend.

MOORE:                    Can you give us some detail on exactly what that package will  look like or what it needs to look like, in your view?

TREASURER:            Well, that's a matter entirely for European leaders, but I think  what it does need to do is to instil confidence in markets. But it's entirely a matter for  the European ministers to talk about what they intend to do via their leaders this  weekend.

MOORE:                    But when you were at this meeting, surely if you were urging  them to come up with a resolution, there was also a discussion about what that  resolution would look like because there's been plenty of talk over a very long period.

TREASURER:            Sure.

MOORE:                    It's the detail that counts.  So in your mind what does that detail  need to be?  What does this package need to include?

TREASURER:            Well, it needs to include a sizeable facility to assist a European  Financial Stability Facility so it needs more resources in that area.  That's on the  public record and that view has been expressed by ministers.

There does need to be a resolution in terms of Greece.  That is very much on the  public record. These are short-term issues. There are long-term issues of fiscal  consolidation, getting their finances in shape.  All of these things are part of the  architecture of a comprehensive response that people want to see from the Europeans  this coming weekend.

MOORE:                    Isn't part of the problem the fact that, or indeed the whole  problem, the fact that the European banks are holding assets on their balance sheets  that are not worth anything like the values that they're written up as and that they  haven't got the capital to take those sorts of losses? Has the EU, as a whole, got the  money to recapitalise those banks?

TREASURER:            Well, first and foremost I think ministers acknowledge that  they need to deal with the sovereign debt issues, and when they've dealt with the  sovereign debt issues they've also got to have a good, hard look at the recapitalisation  of their banking system and there are processes in train for that right now.  All of  these things will need to be done together.  They will need to be part of a  comprehensive package. You can't separate them out.

MOORE:                    But where does the money come from, I guess?  I mean, to deal  with the sovereign debt problem, to deal with the private debt problem.

TREASURER:            Well, it will have to come from within Europe, and that's a  decision for European leaders.

MOORE:                    Is it possible that countries like Australia will be asked to  contribute more to, in particular the IMF, so the IMF can play a bigger role?

TREASURER:            Well, there is a separate question of resources for the IMF and  whether its resources are big enough given the volatility that we are seeing in the  global economy.  But ministers are not looking at providing additional resources to  the IMF over time if they're required as an aid to Europe.  They're prepared to play  their role in backing up Europe, but what the issue of IMF resources is about is the  appropriate size of those resources for the global economy, not just a question of  Europe.

MOORE:                    So it's not likely that we'd be looking to tip in more from  Australia's end?

TREASURER:            Well, the IMF is already involved in a joint program with the  Europeans in Greece.  If there were to be an increase in resources for the IMF it  wouldn't be something which was going straight into Europe, it would be put into a  broader pot that the IMF has available for the future.  Australia would do what it has  done for years and years; we would contribute our fair share, nothing more, nothing  less.

MOORE:                    You make the point regularly that Australia is well placed to  withstand the ill winds from Europe, but the EU is one of our largest trading partners.   I think trade, two-way trade last year, was worth some $78 billion.  That's around 14  per cent of our total trade.  What will the impact of Europe's woes be on Australia?

TREASURER:            Well, there is already an impact in terms of global growth.   Global growth is slowing.  That impacts upon growth in Australia.  That has a  subsequent impact particularly on budget revenues.  So we're already seeing an  impact flow through to Australia but of course, our fundamentals are strong.  We are  in the best position of perhaps any developed economy to withstand the fallout that  we are seeing from these events in Europe.  But we're not immune from the fact that  there are consequences when two of the big economic engines in the global economy  begin to slow.

MOORE:                    Do you expect those trade numbers though to be hit  substantially, that $78 billion will drop dramatically?

TREASURER:            Well, we've just seen in the last couple of weeks very strong  trade numbers for Australia.  Our exports, particularly to our region, are very strong at  the moment.  As you know, our terms of trade are at 140 year highs.  The prices for  coal and iron ore are holding up.

MOORE:                    Sure, but I'm talking to Europe.  Do you expect our trade with

Europe to be hit?

TREASURER:            Well, naturally if Europe continues to slow and there is a long  and painful adjustment in Europe, that will impact on trade between Australia and  Europe.  The point I was making is that our trade focus is shifting increasingly to the

Asia-Pacific, which is still growing strongly.  But I would make this point: that even  the Asia Pacific is not immune from a slowdown in Europe.  So it is all  interconnected, but we are fortunate to be in the right part of the world at precisely the  right time, given these events emanating out of Europe.  We're stronger here, we're

just not immune.

MOORE:                    But of course you are in London.  You have though missed a  fairly crucial Cabinet meeting in Canberra tonight.  Probably a relief, I imagine, given  that leaks were top of the agenda.  Have you had a briefing about that…

TREASURER:            I always enjoy Cabinet meetings, Ali.  I always enjoy Cabinet  meetings.

MOORE:                    Have you had a briefing about tonight's meeting?

TREASURER:            No, I have not had a briefing about tonight's meeting.  I've been  having important discussions, as you indicated earlier.  I've been tied up with very  important work via the G20 Finance Ministers, dealing with these issues in the global  economy and what they mean not just for our region, but for the Australian economy.   That's been the focus I've had over the past few days and it's a pretty important focus  for Australia.

MOORE:                    Indeed, I don't doubt that, but you are the Deputy Prime  Minister.  How can the Cabinet leaks of recent days not undermine the authority of  Julia Gillard?

TREASURER:            Oh, look, I think this wouldn't be the first time that we've seen  reported leaks from Cabinet and it won't be the last under a whole series of  governments, but this is not my focus, Ali.  My focus is getting on with making sure  that we strengthen the global economy, making sure there's a good agenda for the  leaders when they get to the G20 summit in France in a couple of weeks' time.  That's  been my focus.  I think the Australian people are interested in the things that really  matter, which is jobs and economic prosperity.  I don't think they're all that interested  in many of these reports that we're seeing in the media.

MOORE:                    I think though they are - I think it's fair to say - interested in the  process of government and ensuring that we get the best possible government.  And  Julia Gillard said today that she’s, quote: `rebuilt a proper Cabinet system of  government’.  How is the current Cabinet system different to the one before?

TREASURER:            Well, the current Cabinet system is one which uses committees  extensively. Proposals go through subcommittees. They come through to the major  Cabinet.  They are submitted to all of the processes within the bureaucracy.  It's a very

formal Cabinet process - a lot of consultation.  It's working well under the outstanding  leadership of Julia Gillard.



MOORE:                    And how is that different to what was before?

TREASURER:            Well, there's been criticism of processes before, but it's not my  role tonight to go through all of that.  What I do know is the Cabinet process that we  have now is a very good process. There's lots of consultation.  We go through all of  the normal formalities that you'd expect of a Westminster process.

MOORE:                    Would it have made sense for Cabinet to have accepted Nauru  as an option for dealing with asylum seekers as well as the Malaysia solution?

TREASURER:            No, it would not, because it doesn't break the people smugglers'  model.  All of our advice, all of our formal advice from the agencies is that it will not  break the people smugglers' model.  That was the advice.  That is public.  It has been  well known.  It has been repeated by the head of the department in recent days and it  sums up the position of the Government.

MOORE:                    But it does beg the question then of why it was raised in  Cabinet.

TREASURER:            Well, I don't know whether those reports are accurate or not.

MOORE:                    But you must; you were in Cabinet weren't you, last week, last  Monday?

TREASURER:            I don't go into discussions in Cabinet.  There have been a  whole lot of reports which I treat with a grain of salt about what goes on in Cabinet.  I  don't talk about what goes on in Cabinet, but I can talk about what is public from the  head of the major department concerned here, and his unambiguous advice both to the  Government and the Opposition is that that particular policy objective of going to  Nauru doesn't work.

MOORE:                    Well you are Treasurer, you're the one who has to make the  numbers add up and you are still aiming for a surplus.  The cost of detaining and  assessing asylum seekers I think was put at just over $1 billion in this year's budget,  forecast spending of $677 million next year.  Now the policy is different and all  asylum seekers will have to be processed onshore, what does it do to those budget  numbers?  Do they still hold up?

TREASURER:            Well, we're going through all of that assessment right now.  I  couldn't give you an update on that, but there will be an update on that in the normal  processes through the mid-year review at the end of the year.  That's the appropriate  time to provide the update, given the change that has been forced upon the  Government by the decision of the High Court.

MOORE:                    And would it be fair to say that we could expect those numbers  to increase?

TREASURER:            I'm not going to speculate about the nature of the numbers.   They'll be provided, they'll be there for everybody to see and to discuss at the

appropriate time.

MOORE:                    Can you rule out an increase in the budget on this, affecting  your desire for a surplus?

TREASURER:            I'm not ruling anything in or out, but the Government is  determined to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13.

MOORE:                    Well, another key issue, if businesses do buy carbon permits in  the lead up to a full emissions trading scheme and the Coalition wins the next election  and the ETS is repealed, the clean energy legislation is repealed, will those businesses  be compensated?

TREASURER:            Well, the Government is putting this legislation up to the  Senate, it's been through the House of Representatives, it will become the law of the  land.  It's really important for business certainty that we progress with these reforms.

It's also important to tax reform, tripling the tax-free threshold and so on.

So the sale of permits will become the law of the land.  It is deeply reckless of Mr  Abbott and the Liberal Party to talk in the way in which they've been talking about  this issue in the last few days. But given how reckless they are, nothing surprises me.

MOORE:                    But under the law of the land - and of course laws can change -  under the law of the land and according to this legislation, the permits are described as  property, but does that mean that they have compensation attached?

TREASURER:            Look, I'm not going into speculate about what may or may not  happen.  It's the law of the land.  We have put in place...

MOORE:                    But Treasurer, it's actually not speculation.  I'm reading to you  directly, quote: `a carbon unit is personal property.’  So, extrapolating from that, does  that mean that there is attached to the property rights compensation?

TREASURER:            Ali, it's not my job to give legal advice on your program.  It  will be the law of the land and I believe we've put in place for a very important  reason: to drive investment in renewable energy and in cleaner energy.  And for Mr

Abbott or anyone else to go out and advocate people breaching that law is deeply  irresponsible, deeply irresponsible.

MOORE:                    Wayne Swan, I appreciate you looking at domestic issues  because I know you are a long way away.  Many thanks for joining Lateline tonight.

TREASURER:            Thank you, Ali.

(Ends)
