TONY EASTLEY: A Syrian human rights group says at least 80 people,  some of them women and children, have been killed as government  troops stormed a town near Damascus.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deaths occurred  over five days of violence.

Syrian opposition groups claim the figure is much higher.

The Foreign Minister, Bob Carr says a humanitarian disaster has  developed in Syria and the fallout threatens to destabilise both  Lebanon and Jordan.

Senator Carr says the UN needs to separate the political  considerations from the humanitarian crisis, even as it pushes for a  ceasefire. He's pledged an increase of $24 million dollars in  Australian humanitarian aid.

I spoke by telephone to Bob Carr who is in Luxembourg for a meeting  of EU Foreign Ministers, Arabic representatives and the Arab League.

BOB CARR: Well, it's a medical disaster. There were an estimated  5,000 doctors in Aleppo - I've just heard this from an UN authority -  before the war; there are now 36 left. There are an estimated  400,000 injuries, and a large proportion of those can be assumed  can't be treated because doctors and nurses have fled the country  and medicines aren't getting in.

There are people with chronic medical conditions who've no longer  got the medicines access to the drugs they need. No access for  vaccination; reports of typhus spreading throughout the country  because of the shocking sanitary conditions. Sixty per cent of  hospitals destroyed.

TONY EASTLEY: This is far worse than you had thought?

BOB CARR: Yes, it is indeed. And here's a frightening figure that goes  beyond health considerations: it's about the destruction of housing.  It has been put to us at this meeting by UN officials and all the UN  agencies are meeting with us, that by the end of this year there could  be nine million people - out of the 22 million people in Syria - who  have fled their homes.

Now that's a huge displacement. Another figure gives us the scale of  this tragedy, and that is that Lebanon and Jordan at the current rate  of refugee reception could soon be hosting populations of refugees  equivalent to 25 per cent of their own population.

TONY EASTLEY: What is to be done about those medical problems  that you talk about?

BOB CARR: This is an appalling humanitarian catastrophe, and the  plea that I think these foreign ministers have agreed on - and its one  that I've been urging for some time - is for the five permanent  members of the Security Council to dissociate these issues from the

political considerations - that is the quest to get a ceasefire and to  get a transition plan, important as these are, difficult though - to  separate those political considerations from this pressing urgent  desire to answer the welfare of the Syrian people and this  humanitarian crisis. To separate that out from the challenge of a  ceasefire and a political transition and to deal with these now.

TONY EASTLEY: You'll have to get president Bashir al-Assad to sign  off on that. He hasn't been too keen or kept his word on some  promises to date.

BOB CARR: Well, my colleague the foreign minister of Sweden has  just argued very strongly that there's a case for having the highest  UN visit to Damascus to urge president Assad to allow unequivocally  humanitarian access - that is, convoys with medicines and convoys  with foods.

TONY EASTLEY: Senator Carr, is there a problem that in… with the  UN and indeed Australia's support for humanitarian causes in Syria,  is there any general concern that you are, in a way, supporting  jihadists in Syria? That this could end up turning around to bite us?

BOB CARR: I think the challenge for the opposition coalition is to  demonstrate - and it's been using words to this effect, it must see  that these words result in action - that it has nothing to do with  jihadist forces. I think one of the reasons the United States and just  about all of Europe have been opposed to arming the Syrian  opposition is a view based on the experience of Afghanistan in the  1980s that arms will end up in the hands of jihadists.

But the opposition in Syria, I believe, is under pressure to  demonstrate it will have no truck, no alliance, no organisational

contact with those who are fighting the Assad government from a  position of jihadist opposition.

TONY EASTLEY: Australia's Foreign Minister Senator Bob Carr.
