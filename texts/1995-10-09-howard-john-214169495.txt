E&EO.......................................................................................................

H O W A R D :

I think any doubt that we have now started the unofficial part o f the election campaign  was removed yesterday when the Prime Minister began talking about the possibility o f  cuts in interest rates.

Australians have had their fingers burnt once with L-A-W  law tax cuts, they might well  be entitled to think they are being lined up for some L-A-W  interest rate cuts, those  that go down before the election, but go up afterwards.

JO U R N A LIST:

How would they go down M r Howard

H O W A R D :

I think you are probably familiar with the mechanisms for them going down. The point  very simply is we are now into an unofficial election campaign, the Prime Minister has  manipulated all sorts o f things in the past, has every reason to suspect he'd try and  manipulate interest rates.

JO U R N A LIST:

He'd make the Reserve Bank make that decision, is that what you are saying?

HOWARD:

Well, the Prime Minister doesn't finesse on those things. He said yesterday that the  Government put interest rates up last year so presumedly if they put them up last year  they will put them down this year or early next year.

JO U R N A LIST:

Some economists are saying that they will go down before Christmas, what's your  response to that?

H O W A R D :

Well, the bulk o f the economists that I saw reported in the latest Reuter round up  indicated that they thought the pressure on interest rate was in the other direction.

JO U R N A LIST:

M r Howard, what is your response to the Prime Minister saying you don't understand  the needs o f workers?

H O W A R D :

He is the master o f indifference to the Australian worker and he has driven the  Australian workers mortgage bill up 50%, he has cut the real value o f wages o f  Australian workers over the last 13 years, he has delivered the highest sustained level  o f unemployment since the end o f World W ar II, he has no credentials to lecture me or  anybody else about the needs o f Australian workers, he's really has turned his back on  them.

JO U R N A LIST:

According to the Prime Minister without the accord high interest rates are your only  chance o f battling inflation.

HOWARD:

That just shows the desperation o f the Prime Minister's attacks. I mean he from now  on will engaged in lies and personal abuse as a substitute for a policy. He can't offer  hope, he cut run on his record, he can't run on integrity, all he has got left with is to lie  about our policies and to engage in personal abuse o f me.

JO U R N A LIST:

Are you offering anything really terribly different by saying exactly what you have just  M r Howard?

H O W A R D :

We've offered a lot different over the past few months and when the election campaign  starts well have some campaign initiatives to offer which will be very different.

JO U R N A LIST:

...(inaudible) real wages have actually risen under Labor 7%...

H O W A RD :

Since 1990, but what happened before then? I mean under Labor according to his own  figures real wages have fallen, his figures say that, not mine, his figures. And what's  more the cost o f servicing the average mortgage has gone up by 50%. In 1983 it cost  $674 a month it's now $951 a month, now that's a 50% rise in thirteen years. I mean  that's what this man, my Labor opponent has done to the Australian battler.

JO U R N A LIST:

So that's I guess your response to his claims ...(inaudible)

HOWARD:

Well, if you look at the entirety o f the period this Government has been in power, real  wages have fallen and what's more in that time the real cost o f servicing the average  mortgage has gone up by 50% and that is why more than anything else the great bulk  o f Australian people, wage and salary earners, the men and women he ought to be  most concerned about feel under enormous pressure. They are under pressure because

their living conditions have deteriorated.

JO U R N A LIST:

M r Howard, M r Keating gave a speech this morning and I think what he said was  precisely the opposite, that real wages have increased I think about 7% between 1983  and 1995. He says that wages did fall earlier on, but have picked up since....

H O W A R D :

Well, I completely dispute that figure and all o f the data available to me indicates  otherwise and up until now, apparently his reply has been- yes real wages may have  fallen, but you've got to make adjustments. Real wages may have fallen, but you have  got to make adjustments for the so-called social wage. That was the line that he took  in Parliament week after week, he's now apparently producing some new statistics  well, he has taken a long time to find those statistics and one must be suspicious that

like a lot o f M r Keating's statistics they won't carry through on close examination.

H O W A R D :

M r Howard, how can you prove that workers will be better off?

JO U R N A LIST:

I believe that what we offer will give them the hope o f higher wages based on higher  productivity. What I offer is an approach to work place bargaining which will deliver  higher real wages, not lower real wages because it will be based upon the productivity  o f individual firms, it is a policy that will encourage firms and their workers to enter

into more co-operative arrangements to boost the output o f the firms on the basis that  not only the owner, but also the employees share in that boosted output.

JO U R N A LIST:

When will we see those detailed plans?

H O W A R D :

Well, they are inherent already in what I've said about industrial relations. It is  inevitable that if you have a genuine w ork place bargaining system which w e are  committed to and have been for almost 10 years, then you are far more likely to boost

the productivity performance and the competitiveness o f individual firms.

JO U R N A LIST:

M r Howard, would you support the creation o f a fourth free to air commercial channel  specifically providing family programming?

H O W A R D :

Is there such a proposal?

JO U R N A LIST:

There are reports this morning that the Department o f Communications has been asked  to consider that the ABA will be looking at it as part o f its review..........

H O W A R D :

Well, I'm not going to respond to something as hypothetical as that. Now, let me say  this, that I think many Australians, whatever their political views, are concerned about  the depiction o f a lot o f violence on television and on the screen. As to  the best way o f  dealing with that, I think if the matter is approached intelligently from both sides it  ought to be possible to reach some common ground as to the best way o f approaching  it.

I'd have to say that there's already fierce competition for the free to air advertising  dollars and I think that's something that's borne in mind, but until there is a specific  proposal around I'm not going to respond to something that's hypothetical except to  say that I certainly share the view o f many, and I guess it would be on both sides o f  politics, the depiction o f violence is quite negative in many situations and one wonders  whether on many occasions if it's really necessary to the provision o f the entertainment  that is designed to be achieved.
