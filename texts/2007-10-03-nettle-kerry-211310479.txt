Andrews' African refugee ban: ugly race politics

3rd Oct 07

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on Immigration  Minister Kevin Andrews to overturn his ban on taking African  humanitarian refugees, labelling the move 'ugly race politics.'

"It's appalling that the Immigration Minister is cherry picking  Australia's humanitarian refugee intake, to discriminate against  Africans," Senator Nettle said.

"My question to the Minister is will this ban include white  Zimbabwean farmers if they were to apply, or is it just black  refugees that Mr Andrews has a concern about?

"The Minister is effectively saying Australia only wants easy  refugees not those who need more support. It's callous.

"The Greens are particularly concerned for the welfare of  Africans already in Australia who may suffer as a result of the  slur on all Africans that this ugly decision represents.

"Increased support services for newly arrived refugees is the  obvious answer to settlement problems not a knee jerk,  politically suspect decision to ban African refugees?

"The government has failed to provide African and other  refugees witeh the settlement support they need on arrival and  beyond.

"The government has failed the African community and now is  punishing them."
