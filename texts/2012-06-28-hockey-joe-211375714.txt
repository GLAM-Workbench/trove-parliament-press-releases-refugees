PRESENTER:

One of the things we love about the Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey is he wears his heart  on his sleeve and he always has. He joins us now. Joe, a very emotional speech yesterday,  but the Parliament is failing us.

JOE HOCKEY:

I am not sure the Parliament is failing us. I think the fact is you have to live by your  principles. The principles we led down previously worked, the Temporary Protection Visas,  sending people to Nauru or Manus Island to have their applications processed and, where  possible, turning back the boats; that worked. The government changed the law. We didn't

like it. Now they have got problems all over the place. We have said what worked will work  again. I heard Graham Richardson say a little earlier that people from Nauru  overwhelmingly ended up here. He is factually wrong, 30% went back to the country they  came from, 30% went to other countries and about 40% ended up here, so he is factually  wrong there.

PRESENTER:

Okay. But the government is proposing that we do Malaysia and Nauru. They are giving in  on Nauru, why is that not a compromise that you can support?

JOE HOCKEY:

Kochie, I can't support a people-swap deal with Malaysia. They are our friends  diplomatically, but the reason why Malaysia is being used is because it's a very harsh and  unforgiving environment for human beings. Frankly, the government deal is a bad deal.  They say that we are going to send 800 refugees directly to Malaysia, that could include a  13-year-old child, a 12-year-old child, unaccompanied. In Malaysia they get caned, they  have got no passports, they are not recognised as citizens, there is no health care and  there is no education care.

PRESENTER:

Wouldn't that be a disincentive for asylum seekers to try and come here? If they knew they  were going to Malaysia and it was so harsh, it wasn't the land of milk and honey that they  expected to get here they might say "Here or Malaysia?” they might say "Well, it's not worth  the risk."

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, firstly, it's limited to 800 people. Secondly, the fact is that we are human beings  Kochie, at the end of the day, we are human beings. What happened in Nauru is we  supervised these human beings. I mean just picture in your mind what's going on. These  people are desperate to come to Australia. They will do anything to come to Australia. They

get on a rickety boat. They are drowning at sea. What you should do is take them to a  place, see whether they are genuine refugees and resettle them to another country, not  guarantee Australia if they are genuine refugees.

PRESENTER:

Would it encourage them to go to a refugee camp like so many others do and go through  the normal process to come here or another country that is taking refugees? Wouldn't  Malaysia be a disincentive and force or make them rethink and say "hey, maybe I should go  through the proper channels."

JOE HOCKEY:

There are a whole lot of countries which will be disincentives, there is no doubt about that.  Nauru was a disincentive, combined with Temporary Protection Visas. So the guys that are  selling passage to Australia, they have got a product. The product is you get on Australian  soil - that's their product. If you get Australian soil, you end up an Australian citizen. What  we have got to do is stop the product and the way to stop the product, is not to allow them  to get to Australian soil. That's why our 3-pronged approach works - and if they do get to  Australia soil, they are not guaranteed to become permanent citizens - they have  Temporary Protection Visas. When the problems in their home country are resolved, they  can be sent back. Therefore, there is no product to be sold. Temporary Protection Visas,  processing offshore and the third one is, where possible, you turn back the boats.

PRESENTER:

So Malaysia is the sticking point? If the government had said forget Malaysia, it will just be  Nauru, you would be on-board?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes. Tony Abbott offered that yesterday, we also offered to agree with the government and  the other parties to increase the front door humanitarian refugee program to 20,000. We  offered to set up a multi-party committee. We offered to have any number of countries, 148  countries, that processing can occur on, but we are not going to be in a position where we  would send an unaccompanied child to a third party after we had been the legal guardian of  that child’s interests. I don't think any don't think any Australian would want to see that.

PRESENTER:

Alright Joe, we will have to leave it there. We will see you for Big Guns tomorrow. See you  then.
