Australian NGOs to play major support role in Cambodian resettlement  process

The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development,~ today announced  that $5 million would be made available for non government aid organisations  (NCOs) to provide support to resettlement efforts in Cambodia.

"A recent mission to Cambodia, involving AIDAB officials and NCO  representatives, identifed the need for NCOs to provide special support to the  resettlement organised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR)," Mr Kerin said.

Mr Kerin said that funds would be made available through Australia's overseas  aid agency, AIDAB, over the next two financial years, for NCO schemes specifically  targeted at helping returning refugees, internally displaced people, demobilised  soldiers and locally affected communities."

"Reintegration and rehabilitation would be the essential aims of the program," he  said.

NCO proposals for projects to utilise the special assistance program funds will be  considered in priority areas including:

" Primary health care  " Job creation and income generation   " Water sanitation  " Education

" Supplementary food  " Shelter

" Agricultural recovery  " Post trauma assistance.

The funds form part of the $49 million, four-year bilateral aid program for  Cambodia announced in April.
