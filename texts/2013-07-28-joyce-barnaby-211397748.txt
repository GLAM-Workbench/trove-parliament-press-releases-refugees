Interview with Barnaby Joyce and Michael Danby

Australian Agenda program, 28 July 2013



Peter van Onselen:

We are joined now live in the studio by Senator Barnaby Joyce. Welcome to the

program.



Barnaby Joyce:

Thank you for having me on your show.



Peter van Onselen:

We want to talk about boats and we want to talk about carbon pricing, but can I just

start with today's poll. This Galaxy Poll has the Coalition and Labor Party running neck-and-neck at 50/50. My question really goes to this: after three years of yourself and

others telling us how God-awful this Government is, what is so unelectable about the

Opposition that you guys are level pegging in the polls so close to election day?





Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Barnaby Joyce:

Obviously that Mr Rudd's come back and said he's a different person. People give a

person a period of grace. As soon as they start understanding that the Kevin Rudd they

get this time is exactly the same one as they got last time - and the PNG solution is a

classic example of that. At the front end it sounds plausible, at the back end you know

this is the same planning we got with ceiling insulation. Policy on the run, they haven't

thought of it, they are just -  it's almost pathological in this crowd.



Peter van Onselen:

Are you concerned?  You must be concerned, he's been back for a number of weeks

now and the poll says he's still 50/50. He could be at an election in just over four

weeks’ time if he called it, there must be some Coalition rumblings about the fact it's

still 50/50 despite the week that we've seen with the number of boat arrival rivals since

the PNG Solution.



Barnaby Joyce:

No, not really. I think that - I've had 35 town hall meetings so I try to get a fairly good

gauge on what people are saying uninterrupted by the media. It is between me and

them, they can ask whatever question they like. They find Mr Rudd more plausible than

Ms Gillard but that's a statement of the obvious. But they don't see Mr Rudd as a

person whose singularly going to lead the country to a better place, they see him as a

repetition of what they had before and it doesn't take much to remind them of their

financial position, which Mr Rudd cannot argue his way around; the debt position,

which he cannot argue his way around.  He stays statements and then tries to hang off

the back of them like, you know, "I've got the illegal arrivals sorted with the PNG

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Solution".  Implicitly people have a sense of good faith, they go "Oh, well, that's good"

and then they start peeling back the onion and looking inside it.



Peter van Onselen:

But they haven't done that yet, have they, Senator Joyce, because this Galaxy Poll out

today asks the question "Who do you think will be better in handling the issue of

asylum seekers" and perhaps surprisingly, certainly surprisingly to me, Kevin Rudd gets

40% and Tony Abbott and the Coalition get 38%.



Barnaby Joyce:

Well, I think it's going to stand to reason. If you'd asked people at the start of the

ceiling insulation debacle who is best to install ceiling insulation after they'd just

announced a massive program to put ceiling insulation in, people would say "The

people who announce the policy".  The unfortunate reality is they then set fire to 194

houses and unfortunately and tragically four people died. This policy, their PNG policy,

has all the hallmarks of that all over again.  The longer it goes the more ridiculous it

becomes. I was listening to Minister Burke this morning talking that there is no

problems in finding a place for another 1,000 people, even though he hasn't actually

got one of them up there yet.  People are not fools and...



Peter van Onselen:

But if the boats stop or if they slow down considerably - it hasn't happened so far,

we've had over a thousand arrivals in just one week, but if that halves in the second

week or in the third week is that cause for concern from the Coalition perspective, that

they do have a solution under their policy approach to this issue?

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Barnaby Joyce:

Everybody wants a solution to the illegal arrivals issue but the problem we've got,

Peter, is that last night 120 more turned up. It is just -  they haven't sorted this out

because really what you had is an announcement by Mr Rudd. Where was the

planning?  Where did all this come from?  In fact, philosophically where was the

mitigating speech that he gave telling us he was on this journey.  Because at first blush

it sounds like he's gone to obviously to the far Right and he's just hoping that the Left

somehow stays with him behind. Now, we know that that is politically unviable, that

once he gets back into the room with his colleagues the Left are going to say "Sorry Mr

Rudd, you are starting to sound like Ms Hanson and we can't tolerate that".  So this

thing is going to fall to pieces as soon as he gets back with his colleagues.  The other

thing, it is just not even coming together even before he gets there.  What we are

asked to, which we always have with Mr Rudd, we are just asked to trust him.  And you

can't. With the NBN, with ceiling insulation, with the school halls, Fuel Watch, Grocery

Watch, war on obesity, war on inflation, 2020 forums - this is just another chapter and

verse of exactly the same psychology, exactly the same personality, and it will have,

Peter, exactly the same outcome.



Paul Kelly:

Just going back to boats, how wise is it for Tony Abbott to frame this increasingly in

military terms?



Barnaby Joyce:

Well it is, as you would understand, everyone understands, you can't have, as we said,

1,300 people in nine days. It is just implausible that that can go on. If it does go on

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

then we have lost control of one of the most vital elements of what is Australia's

security. If you can't regulate your borders then you have fallen over the first hurdle at

what it is about your national sovereignty. People cannot just make arrangements

about turning up - and that is exactly what is happening. So Tony Abbott has rightly

said we have to have a greater coordination of domestic issues, domestics forces,

forces that we do control. Mr Rudd always seems to go to these sort of foreign policy

outcomes.  And in that marshaling of domestic forces we have the people who can

coordinate a process, who are trained for that process, overseeing that process. I think

that this shows a planning of policy on the premise that we get the great honour of

leading the nation and with the right and competent people at the helm of it.



Paul Kelly:

But is it correct to frame it increasingly in military terms?  Is that the sound response?



Barnaby Joyce:

I think it's a sound response to have the people who have those sort of credentials and

those capabilities at the front end of it, to have those people - military training doesn't

just mean you're off to war, it means you have the capacity to organise, you

understand the platforms that you work with, you understand the capacity to deal with

issues, you understand the scheme of involvement and the field of engagement with

what is a challenge that's coming to your borders. It is what they trained for.



Peter van Onselen:

But no-one understands that better, do they, than the head of the navy. The head of

the navy he actually was one of the commanders that attempted to turn boats back and

tow them back back in 2001. He did one successfully, one was a failure, he talked

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

about it at a Senate hearing. He has come out and said effectively that it is very, very

difficult, if not impossible, to be able to tow boats back. That's the head of the navy.



Barnaby Joyce:

It's not so much just towing boats back, it's making it clear and apparent that they

should turn around themselves and going through the processes that can encourage

people to turn around and go back themselves. This is not a unique -  people put this

up as some sort of unique policy that Australia has just designed for itself. This is also

the policy of many other countries, including the United States of America when they

were dealing with people coming across from Cuba. It's not something that is

impossible otherwise it would be impossible for the Indians and they do it, it would be

impossible for the people of the United States of America and they do it. Australians are

doing no more than what other countries already do.



Peter van Onselen:

Operation Sovereign Borders, which would make some adjustments to the order of who

people report to, putting them under the auspice of the Immigration Minister, is that

designed in a sense to bypass Admiral Griggs who is the head of the navy who has that

view on tow-backs?



Barnaby Joyce:

No, I don't think so at all. I think it's a delivery of policy, it's a period of planning, it's

preparing ourselves, if we get the great honour of government, to have something that

we take to the Australian people to show that we are actually competent. I imagine the

Australian people will put that against - you've seen the Rudd policy, the PNG Solution,

just watch it. This one will go down because it's not that it's not plausible, it couldn't

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

have been done, the problem we've got with this thing is that Rudd designed it and that

is always...



Peter van Onselen:

Malcolm Turnbull has said he thinks it will work.



Barnaby Joyce:

The problem is that Mr Rudd designed this, and everything that Mr Rudd has designed -

tell me one thing that Mr Rudd has designed that has worked.  Just one. I mean,

honestly, do you know one?  See, that's the point.



Paul Kelly:

If we just move to the issue of carbon the Government has announced it will bring

forward the emissions trading scheme. It will have to legislate to do that either before

or after the election if it's re-elected. Are there any circumstances whatsoever under

which the National Party will vote in the Parliament for an ETS?



Barnaby Joyce:

No.



Paul Kelly:

There aren't. What about after the election, if Kevin Rudd wins the election he will claim

a mandate. What does the National Party do then?

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Barnaby Joyce:

The National Party, if Mr Rudd wins then this country is in a real dire straits because

what we will get is a continuation of exactly where we are. Mr Rudd has taken our

gross debt out to now to $262 billion.  He's added $200 billion on to the gross debt

since he came to power. I say to the Australian people, quite clearly, if you want to

know something to talk about at the railway station that's this: if you get this crowd

back for another three years you are well and truly heading out the back door. So the

least of my problems will be the National Party's position if Mr Rudd wins. I will be truly

concerned about where my nation goes.



Paul Kelly:

Sure, but I want to ask you about the National Party's position on an ETS. Are there any

circumstances after an election in which it might conceivably vote for an emissions

trading scheme?



Barnaby Joyce:

If this thing is working, if this whole carbon tax idea is working then it should be all

solved. This is what Mr Rudd wanted. We've got a carbon tax, I came in here this

morning, the temperature seemed roughly where we left it. I don't see anything major

happening climatically. What I do find is that people are getting poorer. What I do find

is manufacturing industries going overseas. What I do find is those who are doing it

tough are literally getting to the end of their fortnight with about $50 in their pocket

and less. What I do find is when I go to have a meeting at a corner store with the

ladies they don't buy coffee they are buying water.  Because they are not buying it -

because they are running out of dough. We have got to reduce the pressures on people

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

because we are taking away their dignity and these sort of self-indulgence of tilts that

Mr Rudd has done has done nothing more than made people poorer.



Paul Kelly:

You think Rudd's action on climate change is actually self-indulgent?



Barnaby Joyce:

What I think is that the people which - when I go down through the New England I find

people who complain about the price of power because it's a price they can't get away

from. They are furious with the fact that they see policy direction that is not talking to

their lives because their lives are about "I don't have money in my pocket. I need to

have more respect in my life. I need to be able to go out with the ladies at the end of

the week and have the dignity of having 20 bucks in my wallet".  They don't, they just

don't buy this idea that Mr Rudd who can't organise ceiling insulation, can't organise a

war on obesity, can't organise the school halls, can somehow manufacture a change in

the climate.



Paul Kelly:

You're convinced that there is really no community support for carbon pricing?



Barnaby Joyce:

What we've seen now is the support - the only support he's got is the support of

reducing it substantially, reducing it down to 25% of what it formally was. Of course

that's always going to get support. But if you said you were going to get rid of it

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

altogether they will get overwhelming support. This is where people read too much of

the policies. Oh well, because it's gone from $24.15 down to $6 that's...



Paul Kelly:

You sound as though you really want to make this an election issue.



Barnaby Joyce:

No, it just infuriates me. It infuriated me since the day they designed this policy.



Paul Kelly:

Essentially what you are saying is the people won't wear it. That's what you are saying,

surely.



Barnaby Joyce:

What do they get for it, Paul.  What exactly do they get?



Paul Kelly:

What's your answer to that?



Barnaby Joyce:

They get nothing. What they get is a massive bureaucracy.

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Paul Kelly:

What about the Coalition policy?  You're saying that the people won't accept action on

climate change in terms of carbon pricing, why would they buy the Coalition policy?



Barnaby Joyce:

Because you're talking about the capacity and incentive scheme that if it brings about

efficiencies then it is overwhelmingly good. If you can bring about a better outcome, if

you can bring about something that is for instance, as I always say, a better internal

combustion engine, then it doesn't have to have anything to do - it is just a good idea

all around.



Peter van Onselen:

But, Senator, if we have such a small output of global emissions what's the point in

going down a policy path like direction action, which will put literally billions of dollars

into this direct action to be able to do what, it won't change the climate any more than

the ETS will because we are such a small nation in the global context.



Barnaby Joyce:

The way I always look at it, Peter, is like this: we didn't have a carbon tax to go from

the horse to an internal combustion engine we had human ingenuity. Human ingenuity

invented the wheel, not a tax. We haven't made the greater efficient moves forward.



Peter van Onselen:

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

But the market did a lot of these things. The market system, not a government-styled

direction action scheme.



Barnaby Joyce:

Not premised by a tax. Not premised by a tax.  So therefore if you inspire ingenuity, if

you invest in ingenuity you get vastly better outcomes than if you say “I'm just going to

hit everybody I see with a broad-based consumption tax delivered to them via the

powerpoint in their house, giving them a direction connection from the Australian

Taxation Office to the corner of their living room just above the skirting boards”.  That

is not going to inspire ingenuity that just inspires aggression, it inspires tax evasion if

you can do it, and the only way you can evade this tax is to leave the country.



Peter van Onselen:

Isn't the Coalition supported policy of a 20% reduction in terms of issues of renewables

the biggest problem in terms of electricity pricing rather than the carbon tax or indeed

the ETS?  A 20% target is a problem.



Barnaby Joyce:

A 20% target that's delivered by such things as efficient - photovoltaic cells is

something that is plausible because ultimately the efficiency in photovoltaic cells is

getting to a point now - and not by reason of a carbon tax, by reason of the clever

people in Germany and China who have developed them as such - to where it can

compete in some instances with coal-fired power.  That is human ingenuity.  We are

borrowing that human ingenuity from countries that don't have a carbon tax and this is

why I find the whole carbon tax/ETS argument so implausible, because we are

borrowing the ingenuity from other people who don't have it.

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Peter van Onselen:

What do you think about the 20% renewable energy target, the cut of 20% in terms of

moving to renewable energy?



Barnaby Joyce:

There is no doubt it puts up the price of power. I'm not going to deny that. I think

there is a greater capacity for that to come back into its own because as the

technological advancements happen in such areas as photovoltaic cells then you have -

and other things such as biomass generation from your sugar mills - the capacity for

this to be an affordable form of power.  But you cannot make a tax more affordable

because a tax by its nature is to make things less affordable.



Paul Kelly:

But Tony Abbott has indicated that in Government he will review the 20% renewable

energy target. Would you like to see some change in that policy given the cost of living

pressures that it does impose?



Barnaby Joyce:

I certainly acknowledge that there is calls, even within my own party, that people have

concerns about it. Senator Boswell has been quite clear about that.



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Yes.



Barnaby Joyce:

And the point of democracy is to reflect the views of your constituency and the views of

the members in the party.  When the review comes up then that policy process will be

at full...



Peter van Onselen:

Can I ask you about the 5% reductions target by 2020. Do you really think that that

matters, whether we achieve that or not?  Do you think that the Coalition policy any

more than the Government policy is going to get us to this 5% target in...



Barnaby Joyce:

I see that we are on the path to get there in any case, and once more that is premised

by a range of things: by a downturn in the economy, by a peel-off starting to happen in

our mining sector. What worries me, Peter, is you might have reached the target but

financially you're also going to reach another target.



Peter van Onselen:

If you do get there, let's say the mining boom comes back between now and 2020.



Barnaby Joyce:

Let's hope the mining boom does.

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Peter van Onselen:

And then threatens this 5% target, do you care, does that matter?



Barnaby Joyce:

Luckily it's not Barnaby the tyrant that's not in politics, it's a member of the National

Party and the National Party has its views on these issues.



Peter van Onselen:

What do you think about the 5% tax?



Barnaby Joyce:

What do you think about it?



Peter van Onselen:

I think I know what you think, that's really the question.



Barnaby Joyce:

I think I know what you think too, but that is not the relevant matter. What the

relevant matter is what the National Party's position is in coalition with the Liberal Party.

We have, to be honest, a more sceptical view than that...

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Peter van Onselen:

You think it's rubbish.



Paul Kelly:

Do you think climate change is a serious problem or do you think it's grossly

exaggerated.



Barnaby Joyce:

I think that climate change is something that is definitely happening and it is going to

happen whether we're on the planet or not.



Paul Kelly:

Can we do anything about it or not?



Barnaby Joyce:

Australia by itself definitely cannot do anything about it. Australia by itself acting solo,

all we can do is make our people poorer.



Paul Kelly:

Is that what we're doing at the moment?

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Barnaby Joyce:

In certain areas we are definitely making our Australian people poorer. It disgusts me

that so many times the people that I represent, the National Party represents the

poorest electorates.  When I go and see the houses and the places where the people

we represent live my mind is purely focused on making sure that the logging industry

works, that the farming industry works, that these people who are sort of dispensed

with by so many other places that live with some form of dignity. When we enforce on

them a policy that they can't escape, that they have to deal with the meagre

circumstances that many of them have, then it is my job politically to go into bat for

them.



Paul Kelly:

I wanted to ask you about foreign investment policy. Do you accept that we have to

receive in this country significantly more investment from China and in particular from

state-owned enterprises?  Do you accept that?



Barnaby Joyce:

Well I accept that it's certainly happening and I accept that Australia's based on foreign

investment. You're a product of it right in front of me. 'Kelly' is not an Aboriginal name

and neither is 'Joyce'. So we are products of foreign investment.  'Van Onselen' is

neither. I accept that. I just think that you've got to have it in the national interest and

of course...



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

How do you achieve that?



Barnaby Joyce:

By making the clear assertion - we are seeing it right now.  We have seen in the papers

lately that Google probably pays less tax than you do, Paul, and I don't know whether

that's in the national interest. I think that you've got to have foreign investment

certainly, but you have to manage it in such a way that it really is adding to the...



Paul Kelly:

The National Party is pretty committed to much greater scrutiny of investment from

China.



Barnaby Joyce:

Yes, that's dead right.



Paul Kelly:

Is that essentially correct?



Barnaby Joyce:

That's correct.



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

What about state-owned enterprises, do you believe that they pose a particular

problem?



Barnaby Joyce:

Well the thing I see with state-owned enterprises is you've got the issue that you are

dealing with the arm of another nation's state. As you are dealing with the arm of

another nation's state it goes from one of investment to also one of foreign relations.

Therefore I think we've got it but I just think that you've got to go into it with eyes

wide open.



Peter van Onselen:

Hold that thought.  We are going to take a commercial break but when we come back

we are going to be joined by Michael Danby from the Government. Perhaps a rare

moment of bipartisanship where there are a member of the other side of the political

divide that has some concern at least about Chinese investment in this country. Back in

a moment.



Peter van Onselen:

Paul Kelly and I have been speaking to Senator Barnaby Joyce.  We are now also joined

by the Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts.  We won't be talking about the arts, if you

don't mind, Michael Danby.  Welcome to the program.



Michael Danby:

Oh that's a shame.  I thought you were going to be talking about live music in Sydney.

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Peter van Onselen:

Not to suggest that it's not important, but just not important this morning.  Before we

do discuss Huawei, which what is we have got you on to do, Michael Danby, I just

wanted to ask one quick question of you from our earlier interview, Barnaby Joyce, the

Local Government referendum.



Now, presumably it still goes ahead if the election is later rather than sooner, but the

Coalition, or at least Tony Abbott, appears to have effectively all but withdrawn

bipartisan support for this.  Are you disappointed?



Barnaby Joyce:

Well, the legislation has been through the Lower House, it's been through the Senate,

we have given it the support to go to a referendum.  That took some negotiation and

quite obviously a number of people crossed the floor and even six people in the Labor

Party in the Senate didn't turn up to the vote.  Of course you can't have pairs on - - -



Peter van Onselen:

You wanted it to succeed, whereas Tony Abbott no longer really cares if it does.



Barnaby Joyce:

I have said clearly I want it to succeed, but the problem I've had to deal with is this.

First of all, I had Simon Crean who said he would stick with it forever, there was just

me and Simon and Simon and me and everything was going to be bliss, then Simon

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

left.  Then I got Anthony Albanese who took me to the front of the stage at the

Australian Local Government Association Conference.  He got me up there, believing it

was a wedge and saying, "You know, Barnaby and I will work this thing through.  You

know, you can rely on me."  Albo said you can rely on me.  Then he disappeared.



Then I had nobody, then I had Catherine King.  I've never met Catherine King.  I

honestly - - -



Michael Danby:

You've been in the Senate, that's why.



Barnaby Joyce:

I wouldn't know if she stood up in my Cornflakes.  So how many people are going to

meet you at the front of the altar before you decide that they are not taking the

relationship very seriously?  They are not - the Labor Party are not serious about this.

It's an afterthought.  If they were serious about it, I'll tell you what, Peter, if they were

serious about it they would treat it like the Aboriginal recognition, the indigenous

recognition, indigenous people now tell me they want to be called Aboriginal not

indigenous, that's why I say Aboriginal.  That's been deferred because they are a bit

uncertain about it.



This one has just been hung out to dry.  You know that and I know that.  So I'm

immensely annoyed because I know it's so important for Local Government.  That's the

shadow that I represent and I have to be honest with them.  The way this is going it

doesn't look good.

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda



Peter van Onselen:

All right, let's move on from Local Government issues to national issues but with an

international flavour, Huawei, which of course is a Chinese state-owned

telecommunications company.



Michael Danby you have been critical of it before.  We were talking on 'Showdown' just

on Tuesday about some of your criticisms.  What's the essence of your concerns?



Michael Danby:

I think we should remain colourblind, first of all, to Chinese direct investment in

Australia, just as we do with Japanese, American or British investment, but Coalition

leaders Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull have received advice from the Director

General of ASIO that this company shouldn't be allowed to invest in the central nervous

system of Australian communications.



We recently had on the front page of a newspaper here the former director of the CIA

saying the same thing.  Now in the middle of that Julie Bishop restates that the

Coalition is going to take this to a review.



Paul, could you imagine if a Labor Government ignored security advice like this?  I

mean you've got a great historical political memory.  We would be in the fifth month of

a Royal Petrov Commission.



Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Paul Kelly:

Why, are they saying this, do you think?  Have they been duchessed by the Chinese?

What's the reason for them taking this position, do you think?



Michael Danby:

I think there is a very extensive effort to push the Huawei point of view.  I think that

that is legitimate for that company to want to invest in other areas of Australia.  Once

we have the national security advice from ASIO saying they shouldn't be allowed to

invest in the central nervous system of Australian communications the Coalition should

take that seriously.



As Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said, they are hopelessly split.  I'm not saying all of

the people in the Coalition have formed a view on this.  I expect Barnaby shares the

view of Philip Ruddock and George Brandis.  This is a matter too serious for Australians

to go to an election without knowing what the Coalition's views are.



Paul Kelly:

So what you're saying is the Coalition's position on this issue does constitute a national

security threat?



Michael Danby:

Potentially, if they don't make their announcement before the election that they will

take the advice of the Australian security services.  This is a company, Paul, that

appeared before the Intelligence Committee at public testimony and confirmed the

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

central contentions of the 'Economist' magazine, the front page, the company that

spooked the world.



Huawei told our public hearing they were a company that had a Communist Party

committee at its head, that they were a national champion by the Chinese Government.

That means they've got $30 billion in soft loans and that their two leading executives

were former military engineers from the Chinese PLA.  This is an unanswerable case, if

you ask me.



Peter van Onselen:

Barnaby Joyce, can I bring you in.  Stewart Robert on the same program I was

speaking to Michael Danby about this on Tuesday, made the point that basically in

government the Coalition would take a closer look at what the security agencies tell it.

You've been critical of Huawei before.  You will keep a close eye in government

whatever is said ahead of the election when you don't have the benefits of full briefings

as opposed to partial briefings?



Barnaby Joyce:

Of course we will take an incredible interest, an intense interest, and a diligent and

impartial look at the information that's presented to us.  Now, I have immense respect

for the work of ASIO.  Obviously I have immense respect for the knowledge vessel that

is encompassed in the CIA.  If our strong allies and our own intelligence agency have a

strong view then I will respect that.



Peter van Onselen:

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

And they do.  They are on the record.  There is significant commentary coming out of

places like the CIA about Huawei and its activities.  Does that give you cause for

certain?



Barnaby Joyce:

Well, obviously I read it.  You know if you're given a job to have some sort of

stewardship for the people you're supposed to represent then you should be aware of

this.  I was also aware of an article written in the 'Financial Review' four months ago

about the employee from Huawei who went - they said they found him, he committed

suicide, so they tell us, in his room in Singapore, but his girlfriend couldn't work out

why that would have happened and he was strongly involved in some of the cryptic

encoding part of this company, and, you know, I think this is something that we need

to be fully focused on.



Michael Danby:

There is a strong view in the Coalition we should just go for the lowest common

denominator, the lowest price, that's one of the rationales for letting them be involved

in the NBN.  The Australian people rely on people in the Coalition facing this election

saying that that's not the only way they look at things.  Just lowest price, they must

take into consideration national security advice as well.



Peter van Onselen:

But I'm interested in this from the standpoint you are both frontbenchers on your

respectful sides of politics, you've both been outspoken about Chinese state-owned

enterprises investing in this country at various moments of time, but both your sides of

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

politics in a sense are less concerned about this issue, whether it is targeted on Huawei

or not, and each of you have expressed concerns.



I wonder how you approach colleagues to win them over to your concerns, if at all?



Barnaby Joyce:

The wonderful thing about the Australian democratic process we are both involved with.

I'm free to have this discussion.  That's the way it should be.  Once you feel that that's

encompassed, or once you feel that there is caveats put on how you can express

yourself, especially when you've been given that position by the people who elect you

and I don't know whether I'll get the honour to be elected by the people of New

England, we will see what happens, then you are almost honour-bound that you should

be a little somewhat fearless in trying to make sure that you say what you believe to be

the truth.



Now, if other people believe that you are wrong they are just as entitled to engage you

in a debate and pull your argument to pieces, but - - -



Paul Kelly:

Well, one of the features of this situation is that this company has been very successful

in recruiting former high-profile politicians, such as former Foreign Minister Alexander

Downer, such as John Brumby, so what is your view about this?  Should people be

careful about such associations?  Do you think this is appropriate?  How much influence

have these former politicians had on the debate?



Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Michael Danby:

I think they've got a great deal of influence because they've got a great deal of

credibility.  I wouldn't say their influence is illegitimate.  They work for the company.

They say what you'd expect them to say, and I expect the great two democratic parties

of this country, the Labor Party and the Coalition to respect more important national

interest politics rather than just lowest common denominator commercial interests.



Paul Kelly:

One proposition I want to put to you which has been put to me from certain people

about this is "the Americans stitched us up", that is the Americans briefed our

intelligence agencies and our intelligence agencies just repeated what they were told by

the United States.



Barnaby Joyce:

I think that is implausible.  I - - -



Paul Kelly:

Michael Danby, what's your view?



Michael Danby:

I met as part of the Intelligence Committee's work Malcolm Rivkin in Canada.  That's

not the view - the non-partisan view of the British committee that does the same work

as the Australian committee does.  Similarly in Washington our very capable

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

ambassador Kim Beazley had us all meet the US House of Representatives nonpartisan

Committee on Intelligence.  They had the same view.



So it is trite to say that, you know, we are being stitched up by the Americans.  This is a

very serious view, Paul, it is something that all Australian politicians, however high-flying they are in the Coalition, Julie Bishop or Malcolm Turnbull, should take.



Barnaby Joyce:

I don't think it is plausible to say that the Australian people are so bleak and ASIO is so

bleak that they just take a file from another country and accept it as the gospel truth.

That is just - Paul it's just not correct.



Paul Kelly:

Barnaby Joyce, how serious do you think are the divisions inside the Coalition at senior

ranks on this issue?



Barnaby Joyce:

I can be honest with you.  I've never seen any real divisions at all.



Paul Kelly:

What do you think Tony Abbott's real preference is?



Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Barnaby Joyce:

I have never had a discussion with Tony about exactly what his position is on this.  I

have never asked for one and it's never been - - -



Paul Kelly:

It's hard to believe if Tony Abbott becomes Prime Minister and he receives these sorts

of security briefings, that he would ignore them?  That's not really credible, is it?



Barnaby Joyce:

No, I think - one thing I'm certain about Tony, Tony is a patriot and I'm sure that Mr

Rudd is as well.  If they receive the briefings they will definitely put our nation first and

they will definitely take on board, you know, what the issues are pertaining to that.



I don't think any lobbyist is going to have the capacity to effect, for whatever their

flaws, for whatever people might think of either Mr Rudd or Mr Abbott, I don't think

either of those people are made of something which can be affected by, you know a

lobbyist coming in the door and saying change your opinion to the advice given to you

by ASIO.



Michael Danby:

Julie Bishop will be Foreign Minister if the Coalition were to be elected, Malcolm

Turnbull Communications Minister, both of them, I would concede, are obviously

patriotic people.  I would say the same of Turnbull - sorry, of Brumby and Downer, but

they are simply giving the wrong advice or receiving the wrong advice, and people have

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

the right before the election to sort of hold them to account to make sure they balance

commercial interests versus national interests.



Peter van Onselen:

Michael Danby, you have concerns, as you say, about Julie Bishop as Foreign Minister

given some of her perspectives on Huawei.  What about Kevin Rudd back as Prime

Minister after what he has said about the Chinese leadership before after Copenhagen?

He didn't exactly describe them in glowing terms, although I would describe it as

colourful what he had to say.



Michael Danby:

Well, colourful expressions behind the scenes don't reflect the policies of the Australian

Government, and Mr Rudd as Prime Minister, Gillard before him was very encouraging

of productive relationship with China - - -



Peter van Onselen:

We might say that publicly, we now know what he thinks privately because it was

reported and not denied.  That's got to be an issue for our ongoing relationship with

foreign powers as important as China?



Michael Danby:

I think the Chinese leadership have reacted very well to this current government, both

Rudd and Gillard, Gillard did a fantastic job when she was over there and the Prime

Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Minister Kevin Rudd has had a very good relationship with the Chinese in his new

incarnation as Prime Minister.



Peter van Onselen:

Michael Danby, thanks very much for your joining us on this episode of Australian

Agenda.  Barnaby Joyce, same to you.  But just before you go, I want to ask you last

question - - -



Barnaby Joyce:

What do you mean just before I go?



Peter van Onselen:

One more question until we lose you until after the election, where we will hopefully

have you back.  The National Party in government during the Howard years was seen

as pretty subservient to the senior Coalition partner the Liberals.  It lost seats to

independents in a sense that a lot of Nationals that I spoke to for the Howard

biography made the point they felt in hindsight that they gave up too much to be part

of a coalition in government.



Is the National Party going to have a rethink when it is back in government, if it is back

in government, with Tony Abbott about just how much it muscles up on issues that it is

concerned about?





Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Barnaby Joyce:

I'll answer that question with another question, do you get the sense, Peter in your

discussions with me that they have got me under control?



Peter van Onselen:

No, I do not, although you've been very controlled today.  So maybe it's a fair question.



Barnaby Joyce:

We are our own party, the National Party is its own party and we have a business

relationship with the Liberal Party who on many issues we have a philosophical

alignment to.  The Greens have a philosophical alignment to the Labor Party on many

issues.  We will do our job representing our regional people and the National Party

selects their own suite of people and the Liberal Party selects their own, then we get

together and form a Coalition.



Peter van Onselen:

All right, no right of reply on that Greens jibe, Michael Danby.



Michael Danby:

I've got a picture on my website of Julie Bishop and Sarah Hanson-Young voting down

the Malaysian Agreement, so if someone wants to look I've got the proof.





Australian Agenda 28 July 2013 Australian Agenda

Peter van Onselen:

You have both got an advertisement in before we go.  Barnaby Joyce, Michael Danby, I

appreciate you joining us on Australian Agenda, thanks for your company.



Barnaby Joyce:

My pleasure.
