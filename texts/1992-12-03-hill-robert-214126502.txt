HILL URGES FURTHER A~STRALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL ACTION atÃÂ)

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill,  today urged Australia and the international community to consider  immediate measures to encourage a return to democracy and an end  to human rights abuses in Burma.  He made his comments in a speech prepared for a conference on  Burma at Griffith University in Brisbane. The speech, entitled

"Burma: The Coalition's Perspective", was delivered by the  Liberal Member for Moncrieff, Mrs Kathy Sullivan.

Senator Hill said the Coalition remained deeply concerned about  appalling human rights abuses in Burma, and there could be no  doubt the situation in the country required immediate attention.

He said Amnesty International had said in a recent report that  human rights were being "grossly and persistently violated"  throughout Burma, and that the victims came from every section  of society and every ethnic and religious group.

The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which came  to power in 1988 and held elections in 1990, had outlawed all but  seven of the 233 parties which contested the elections. \  Senator Hill said that d~spite Burma's parlous economic state,  the country had reportedly spent at least $600 million on arms

in the past two years.  Burma was believed to be the world's largest heroin exporter, and  there was speculation that some of the drug money was being used  by the Burmese regime to fund arms purchases.

Senator Hill said the Federal Opposition believed that further  measures must be .taken to pressure the SLORC towards democracy  and the cessation of human rights abuses.

The Coalition believed that if efforts by the United Nations  General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR)  were unsuccessful by early next year, the issue of Burma should  become the subject of UN Security Council deliberation.

He said an international arms embargo, which could be applied by  the Security Council, would have a considerable effect on Burma .

"The Coalition believes that the international community must  explore all measures to place pressure on Burma," Senator Hill  said. Â·

"The Coalition also believes that the Australian Government has  been slow in its reactions to Burma.

"It was slow in stopping Australia's aid to Burma, it was sloppy  in implementing the arms embargo, and it has been hesitant in  regional and international forums.  " "The Australian Government has criticised private sector trade with Burma, but has kept open the Austrade office in Rangoon.

"The Federal Opposition believes that the Australian Government  needs to make a greater effort to raise regional and wider

international awareness of what is happening in Burma."  (ends)
