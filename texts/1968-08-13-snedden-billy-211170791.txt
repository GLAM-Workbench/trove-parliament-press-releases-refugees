Five members of an Itailian family named Lo Piccolo

would be admitted to Australia o n co nZpassionate grounds, the

Minister for Immigration, Mr. Snedden, announced today.

Their _admission would re--unite a family, which was

an important consideration in these cases, he said.

Those who would now be able to enter Australia were

Antonino Lo Piccolo, 71, his wi fe s Rose 66, their daughter p Anna 419 and sons, Giovanni, 37, and Renato, 26.

They would Join four sons, Giuseppe; Benito,

Baitolo and Angelo Lo Piccolo, living in Melbourne.

Hr. Sriedden said that in cases of people seeking

admission to Australia when they could not meet normal selection criteria : he had the responsibility to ensure that

they would not be a charge on the cor?nunity and that they

would be maintained adequately if they came to live in

Australia.

There were always Iroblenls for those with afflictions

which were intensified by the strains of settling into a new

community.

An important factor, particularly for adults,  ts, was that they would be able to obtain employment.

In this case the four Lo Piccolo brothers now in

Australia would care for those arriving and they had _made satisfactory arrangements for employmen t and accommodation.

Indeed, the brothers themselves would provide t he employment,

and this morning they had signed guarantees of maintenance.

"Having satisfied myself on all aspects of the

reception and after--care of the nominees, I was able to make

the decision authorising their entry, Snedden said.
