GREENS MOVE FOR A NEW BEGINNING ON ASYLUM-SEEKERS

The Australian Greens have called for discussions with the new Immigration Minister, Chris  Bowen, to work towards a more sensible approach to asylum-seekers, according to Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young.

Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, says she  has written to Mr Bowen to congratulate him on his appointment and to seek to establish a  workable relationship with regular meetings in the new Parliament.

“Mr Bowen’s appointment provides a new opportunity to convince the Gillard Government  that its offshore processing policy and suspension of asylum claims for Afghans is not the  answer,’’ Senator Hanson-Young said.

“The Coalition has made it quite clear that it is not interested in changing its inhumane  approach.

“This is an opportunity for the Gillard Government to break free of the race to the bottom on  refugees that was displayed in the recent election campaign.

“Australia should not be trying to palm off its responsibilities as a regional leader to the  poorest nations in our region, whether it be East Timor, Nauru or somewhere else.

“This week I will be travelling to Darwin to visit immigration facilities and see for myself the  conditions in the centres, which have already been the subject of criticism.

“There are a number of key immigration issues the Greens want to work with Mr Bowen to  resolve.’’

These issues include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Lifting the suspension of Afghan asylum claims  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ending the practice of children in immigration detention  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Abandoning the Government’s East Timor Solution and drawing a line under further

offshore processing  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An end to indefinite and long-term detention, with judicial review of detention beyond  30 days  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A public campaign to provide the facts to the community and promote the positive

and valuable contribution refugees have made to Australia.



“We need to do better in providing information to the Australian people, to help them  understand that asylum-seekers are not to be feared, and that their numbers are small  compared to the 50,000 overseas visitors who overstay their visas every year,’’ Senator  Hanson-Young said.

“We oppose offshore processing as a solution to deal with vulnerable asylum-seekers. They  should be brought to the mainland and housed close to appropriate support and services,  where they can be processed quickly, fairly and humanely.

“The Greens will continue to stand up for the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees and  champion a more compassionate approach which a growing number of Australians agree  with.’’
