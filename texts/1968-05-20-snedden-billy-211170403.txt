FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION CANBERRA A.C.T.

PRESS STATEMENT BY THE DEPARTME1TT OF IIV 11TGRATION .

As a further step in streamlining migration

procedures Australian residents will no longer have, to provide photographs of relatives and friends they want to

sponsor as unassisted migrants to Australia..

Until now the unassisted migration sponsorship

form lodged in Australia had to be accompanied by recent photographs of the nominees. The Department of Immigration will now obtain the necessary photographs from nominees

when their applications are being considered overseas.:

The new arrangement will relieve sponsors of

possible inconvenience and delay in obtaining photographs

of their relatives and friends before the-sponsorship can

be initiated.
