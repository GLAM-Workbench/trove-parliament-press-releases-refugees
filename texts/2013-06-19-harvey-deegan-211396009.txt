Subjects: The situation in Syria and the use by its Government of  chemical weapons on its people and Julian Assange.

19 June 2013

HARVEY DEEGAN: Joining me online now is Foreign Affairs Minister  Bob Carr. Good afternoon Minister.

BOB CARR: Harvey, good afternoon.

HARVEY DEEGAN: We're going to talk about a couple of things. First  of all the situation in Syria, it has been identified now that the  regime, the Assad regime in Syria have been using chemical weapons  against its people. That's abhorrent, what are we doing about that?

BOB CARR: Well we're seeking the only thing that can protect the  people of Syria and that is a ceasefire and a democratic transition  towards Syria where the Government will be chosen by the people. A  luxury the people of this country haven't had in all the decades of  the Assad one-party dictatorship. That's the Australian goal. And  we've engaged throughout the Arab world, we've spoken to our  friends, the US, the UK, France about this. The suffering of the

people is acute, I've spoken to refugees in Jordan and only a month  ago in Lebanon I've spoken to people who have lost everything.  They're in these camps or settlements as they call them in Lebanon  with only the clothes they stand in.

HARVEY DEEGAN: Having said that and it's a noble aim, there's no  two ways about that, but does Syria really care, does the Syrian  regime really care what we in Australia think?

BOB CARR: I think … the short answer is they don't. They're battling  for survival. This is a no holds barred contest for political power  inside a country that's seen the housing of millions of its people  destroyed, that's seen nearly 100,000 people killed. I was speaking to  a nun who worked in Syria and is in contact with the opposition  inside the country. And again she confirmed to me - she's just left  my office - she confirmed to me the acute suffering of people in  cities like Aleppo and Qusayr, I met refugees myself from Qusayr,  who've lost everything. Imagine losing your home, having members  of your family killed, shot dead in the street, perhaps taken away and  tortured and then killed, imagine losing your car, imagine having to  flee your country not able to take a back pack because that would  identify you as a refugee getting out of the country. And getting over  the border in night and standing in a refugee camp with very little.

I'm proud to say that one thing we have been able to do is to get  assistance so that when they arrive in those camps they've got tents,  they've got drinkable water and that the poor youngsters, some of  whom who have got there without parents have got child protection  workers and some makeshift schools and some things to play with.  But it is desperate for the youngsters.

HARVEY DEEGAN: There's nothing much we can do I suppose until  these people leave the Syrian border and seek refugee status

elsewhere or at least humanitarian aid elsewhere. Can we do  anything for those that are suffering within Syria's borders?

BOB CARR: Yeah well that's a good question. I've gone hoarse talking  to other countries about the need for what I call a medical pact, an  agreement that even while the fighting is taking place. While we're  not achieving our goal of a ceasefire or a political transition we can at  least get agreement that doctors and nurses won't be targeted. At  the present time you've got doctors and nurses who are accused of  treating someone from the other side being shot dead in the foyers  of hospitals. You've got hospitals used as bases, you've got hospitals  being targeted. You can't get medicine into the country. You've got  people in Damascus or Aleppo with ordinary medical conditions  quite apart from wounds or trauma, conditions like a heart condition  or diabetes who can't get the medicines that keep them alive. So I've  urged, I've said this until I've gone blue in the face talking to foreign  ministers or at international conferences, we need an agreement to  get medical convoys into the country and able to move from one  zone to the other zone and a solemn agreement from all the militia  that they won't shoot doctors and nurses and they will protect  hospitals. I can't believe how hard it is to get something as minimalist  as this.

HARVEY DEEGAN: Certainly haven't had any response to that then?

BOB CARR: Well I mean foreign ministers [indistinct] say it's  desirable, they can see the case for it. I raised it with Ban Ki-moon  and I raised it with special representative Brahimi, but they all seem  focused - and it's not really a criticism, but they all seem very  focused on the bigger goal which is the ceasefire and a new  transitional authority in the country and they can't think that while  they're failing to get that, there's an overriding merit in getting

something as basic as medical aid and protection for the people who  deliver it.

HARVEY DEEGAN: The US are suppling direct military aid to the  Syrian Opposition. What's our profile on that?

BOB CARR: Yeah we don't take that approach. We respect America's  role to respond as it has done. I think there is a challenge, and  indeed the Americans have acknowledged this, in being able to say  where weapons given to the Syrian National Coalition might end up.  I'm not sure you can contain things so that there's little or no chance  of their ending up with some of the jihadists, some of the extremists  who are fighting with the opposition. And I think again from our  approach it's not Australia's … [indistinct]. We will continue to focus  on humanitarian assistance so that those wretched suffering people  in the camps in Lebanon and in Jordan get assistance. And then our  advocacy of a medical pact, that's the second leg of our Syria policy.  And third supporting the quest on the Security Council where we're  now a non-permanent member to get that political solution - to get  negotiations between America and Russia and with their support to  get the competing forces inside the country to stop shooting at one  another and negotiate a peaceful transfer of power.

HARVEY DEEGAN: You mentioned Russia, it seems to me on the little  that I've read on this subject, they simply don't believe what the US  are saying about the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

BOB CARR: No, I think that's true. Only the Russians can describe  their position Harvey, but I don't think anything's to be gained by us  demonizing the Russians. They've got an assessment of their national  interest here. After Libya they harbour a sort of scepticism about  what the west is about. As I look at Libya, we went in there with the  United Nations mandate for humanitarian intervention to save

people from being slaughtered by the Gaddafi forces and stuck at it,  the NATO forces with the UN endorsement until we got something  else which is regime change.

So there's a deep seated Russian resistance, we won't go into it but  there are probably half a dozen reasons why the Russians adhere to  the position they adhere to. I would simply urge them and I put this I  might say without success to their foreign minister, Foreign Minister  Lavrov. I'd urge them once again to consider that medical pact that  Australia's supporting and advocating and to think again about the  overriding objective which is to end the suffering of the people of  this country. There's one figure I saw which suggests that if this  fighting goes on, by the end of this year the housing of nine million  people out of 22 million Syrians will have been destroyed. Now that's  just frightful.

HARVEY DEEGAN: It is. We are all keen to see the end of the Assad  regime in Syria. A lot of us might think then that by supplying aid and  perhaps arms to the rebels it might hasten that procedure. Why  won't you consider that as indeed the Americans are doing?

BOB CARR: I think first it would simply be an invitation for Russia and  Iran to load up their assistance to the Assad regime even more. And  then you've got an arms race when it comes to outsiders providing  arms for the forces contesting political power inside the country.

HARVEY DEEGAN: Right. Well, we'll move on just to another topic  before I let you go, Minister, and that is the situation with Julian  Assange. It seems that you've completely cut him off from any sort of  aid at this stage. Is that…?

BOB CARR: No. That's wrong. That's wrong. I was asked - that was a  misleading report. I was asked a question in Senate Estimates about

whether we would take up his legal case in the US. And I said, no we  wouldn't. First of all, he's not charged with anything in the US. He's  not facing extradition to the US. The US Ambassador in Australia is  quoted as saying, he rules it out. So that's what I was responding to.  The fact is, he's received consular support and like any Australian in  trouble with the laws overseas, he'll continue to get Australian  consular support.

But I just want to emphasise to your listeners that Julian Assange is  not cooped up in that Ecuadorian Embassy in London because of  anything to do with the Americans or Wikileaks or intelligence or  security. He's there because the Swedes want to interview him  formally and officially about criminal allegations made in Sweden.  And second, the Swedes have won their case in the British courts to  be able to have that access to him. The British courts have said an  extradition to Sweden is altogether appropriate and he's dived into  the Ecuadorian Embassy in Knightsbridge to avoid that.

Now, in this argument, Australia's got no standing. There's nothing  we can do to help him except to continue to offer him consular  support, and the last I heard, he's declined to take the phone calls  from the Australian High Commission in London.

HARVEY DEEGAN: What are his chances of winning a Senate seat,  Bob?

BOB CARR: Well, that's up to the electors in Victoria. I don't want to  comment on that. But I just want to say, again, that this is not  anything to do with Wikileaks. So if you think his role was heroic on  Wikileaks, and I think it was a dubious role because he refused to do  what The Guardian newspaper wanted to do and that is to remove  the names of people from American cables, and as a result the lives

of people cooperating with the Americans in Afghanistan or  elsewhere were put at risk.

This has got nothing to do with that. It's about the Swedes seeking to  interview him about an allegation of sexual assault, and wanting to  interview him on Swedish soil which is a requirement of Swedish law.

HARVEY DEEGAN: Minister, we appreciate your time. I have to  repeat things that have been said on this radio station in the past  that you are a most compliant minister when it comes to making  yourself available, and the media does appreciate that. We  appreciate it at 6PR. Whether we agree with some of the things you  do, well that's another matter. But again, thanks for your time today.

BOB CARR: Okay. Good on you, Harvey. Thank you.

HARVEY DEEGAN: That is Bob Carr, Foreign Affairs Minister.
