ABC News 24 Capital Hill — Panel discussion  with Lyndal Curtis  Subjects: Asylum seekers, At Home with Julia, polls

Transcript, E&OE

20 September 2011

LYNDAL CURTIS: It's been debated from the Caucus floor to the Parliament floor, but the stand-off over what to do about changes to the Migration Act to allow offshore processing of asylum  seekers shows no sign of being resolved.

The Opposition says even if its amendments to change the Migration Act to allow Nauru to be used  as a processing country but not Malaysia even if they're defeated it won't support the government's  amendments. The government's appealing time and again to the national interest but it does look  like the option it will be left with at the end of the day is onshore processing only.

Joining me to discuss the day's events are Labor parliamentary secretary Richard Marles and  Liberal MP Barry Haase.

Welcome to you both.

Richard why has the government flatly ruled out Nauru and not used it in the same way that you are  using Manus Island and Papua New Guinea as an adjunct to the Malaysia transfer deal?

RICHARD MARLES: Manus was always seen as being complementary to Malaysia. Malaysia  was always the main play here. It's the main play because it's the most significant deterrent and that  is, if you pay a people smuggler to come to Australia, you'll be taken back to Malaysia and you're  essentially in the position that you started from, in which case you've done your money. And so  that's where our focus has been because that is the solution which is actually going to be the biggest  deterrent and see boats stop coming.

The fact of the matter is, in terms of Nauru, it's simply not an option which would act as an  deterrent.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But that's Nauru on its own. If you were to go to the Opposition now and say  we will use Nauru in the same way we're using Manus Island as an adjunct to Malaysia, if you let  us have Malaysia we'll process on Nauru as well. Isn't that a possible compromise?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, the key issue here is seeing the Malaysian proposition actually come  to be because that is the proposition which acts as the biggest deterrent. What we're seeing from  Tony Abbott is a complete failure of leadership. I mean what is a very difficult problem to begin  with has obviously been made more complex by the High Court, and really this mob here have  stopped trying to solve the problem, they're now just playing politics and they've flatly rejected  Malaysia. And so without Malaysia in the mix this thing doesn't work.

LYNDAL CURTIS: I'll ask you that just briefly one more time. Could you offer to the Opposition  the compromise, if they accept Malaysia you'll include Nauru in the same way you're using Manus  Island?

RICHARD MARLES: The question is for the Opposition as to whether or not they are going to  contemplate supporting Malaysia, and that's the question that they need to answer.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Barry, the Coalition's conversion to having offshore processing countries as  signatories to the UN Convention on Refugees is only recent, it's not something that was talked  about, well, before the election, it's not something that John Howard had as a condition. Why is it  important now?

BARRY HAASE: It wasn't a question in the early stages. We had Nauru, we built the  infrastructure, we managed the facility. That's a very very different kettle of fish to the proposition  to send refugees who have come to this country seeking refugee status to be sent offshore that a)  still permits caning and secondly is not a signatory to the convention. Vast difference.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But, the Howard Government sent asylum seekers to a country that was not a  signatory to the UN Convention.

BARRY HAASE: Indeed, not one that inherently canes as a form of punishment, and not one  where that government would be maintaining facilities.

We built and we maintained the facilities, and that could happen again under this government  because it's still recent history when there wasn't a refugee, there wasn't an influx of boats problem.  There was no problem, we had a total of four people in detention seeking refugee status, and then  the protection system was changed. And since then we've had something like 12,000 people, and  we have a problem and this government is now saying please help us solve the problem that we  created. It's hardly fair.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Could you accept having the government using Nauru as it is proposing to  use Manus Island but also Malaysia and then let the government policy of Malaysia stand or fall on  its merits? If it doesn't work then it's the government's fault.

BARRY HAASE: Our policy is to have refugees sent offshore only to those countries that have  signed the Convention. It's very simple, it's very fair, it's very understandable under the  circumstances, and that's our policy.

RICHARD MARLES: Well the question for Barry in that event is whether he supports the idea of  turning boats around and sending them to Indonesia where there are no protections in place, which  is a country that is not a signatory of the Refugee Convention and where there is nothing like the  same protection as has been negotiated by the government with Malaysia.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Well, Barry…

BARRY HAASE: You get to ask the questions, Lyndal. The situation was put well by you when  you suggested that any solution is a mosaic of policies, it's not a single policy. If you take any  single policy and you analyse it you're going to find flaws, but the reality is offshore processing and  temporary protection visas stopped the flood of boats, it stopped the cost to the taxpayers of  processing refugees.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Do you still think that turning back the boats is an option that should be used?

BARRY HAASE: If there's a circumstance where it is obviously safe and able to be done then  boats ought to be turned around, but it's not always the case, it's not always safe and it's not always  an option.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Even though, as Richard pointed out, they would end up in Indonesia, a  country that's not a signatory to the Convention.

BARRY HAASE: I said if it was safe to do so. And sending back to where there is no convention,  that couldn't be considered as safe in my opinion.

RICHARD MARLES: Well okay, that's completely contrary to what the Liberal Party are saying  at the moment which is that they will send people to Indonesia by virtue of turning boats around.  And the definition of safe, as it's been articulated by Scott Morrison, is safety in the context of the

boat not safety once you get to Indonesia.

The point that we would make is that in terms of doing a swap to Malaysia the transit to Malaysia is  completely safe, people will be on a plane and once they get there there will be a whole lot of  protections that have been negotiated with the Malaysian Government in concert with the UNHCR.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Julia Gillard made much in the parliament of the fact that she'd consulted the  Opposition, she offered them briefings, she gave them a meeting with her when they want it. But  there's a point at which the government stops negotiating isn't it, there's a point at which you're  saying these are our amendments and we're not moving from them. Are you prepared to negotiate  any more with the Opposition?

RICHARD MARLES: Look we've been acting in good faith around this issue. What we've seen  though is this rank hypocrisy from the side of the Opposition who on the one side throw their —  well to start with actually we're talking about a five for one deal in relation to Malaysia, there was  no sense of concern there about human rights. Now they've suddenly found their bleeding heart and  they're talking about human rights, and yet at the same time happy to send people to Indonesia  where there are none of these protections in place.

The fact of the matter is the Opposition are not acting in good faith. They have lost sight entirely of  the national interest. The opportunity for leadership on the part of Tony Abbott has been missed  and these people have stopped trying to solve the problem and they're just playing politics.

BARRY HAASE: Lyndal might I make the point that there was no problem and that thousands of  refugees coming via leaky boats today are the result of a change, a trashing of secure border  policies that we had in 2008. So when it comes to any degree of hypocrisy surely trashing the  solution, creating the problem and then coming with a begging bowl for support from the  opposition to government, it's a rather odd…

RICHARD MARLES: A small issue of the High Court decision…

LYNDAL CURTIS: How though are your votes likely to view the government and the Opposition  now standing back and essentially blaming each other for not being able to solve this?

BARRY HAASE: Oh look any rational Australian, especially those viewing your programme, will  understand that if one creates a problem they shouldn't turn when they've been forewarned,  extremely forewarned, one shouldn't turn to the enemy and ask for a solution.

It's our job to change the government of this nation, it's our job to make sure that the population has  the opportunity to be governed well. For that we need an election of course.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard just quickly before we move on to another issue. You're  parliamentary secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, have you been talking to Papua New Guinea  about what's happening with the policy in Australia? And what's their view?

RICHARD MARLES: Well PNG have obviously been briefed about the decision of the High  Court and what it means. In terms of the points that's Barry has just made, I mean it's not a small  detail what's happened with the High Court, it kind of has changed things a little bit. I mean it  would mean that the Nauru and Manus option that was pursued by the Howard government would  no longer be legal. So to suggest that this is all the government's making is completely wrong.

But in answer to your question, we've briefed the Papua New Guinean Government on that and  we've obviously told them that we now have a fair bit to do at home in terms of working out a  domestic response to that. And that's where we're at.

LYNDAL CURTIS: If we could move on now…

BARRY HAASE: Lyndal, I must correct a falsehood. The High Court ruling was in relation to  Malaysia, they have not ruled out the Nauru situation. And the Nauru situation was in place,  problem solved, no boat people arriving. You mustn't overlook that.

RICHARD MARLES: The Solicitor-General has said that there's now doubt around that.

BARRY HAASE: [Indistinct]. But it is relevant to your viewers that they understand that there was  no problem, a problem was created and now people are casting about to find a solution to problem  they created. [Indistinct].

RICHARD MARLES: The Solicitor-General has made it clear that there is doubt around the  Nauru Manus proposal that was put in place by the Howard government and Scott Morrison  acknowledges that.

LYNDAL CURTIS: If I could just move on briefly. Barry, there was a bit of discussion in the joint  party room — in the Liberal National Party room today about the ABC's At Home with Julia  program. Have you seen it and what do you think about it?

BARRY HAASE: I saw the first show, thought it was unfunny, a bit grubby. Not my call, if the  ABC decides that something is viewable satire and being attractive for their audience so be it. If  they get it wrong the audience will let them know and they'll stop showing it.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard, have you seen it? What do you think of it?

RICHARD MARLES: I haven't seen it, I wouldn't disagree with what Barry said. Look, I think it  is the job of comedians to push the envelope. For my money I do actually think that there is  something about the dignity of the flag and the office but I've known Julia Gillard for a long time,  she's a person with a very robust sense of humour and this will be water off a duck's back for her.

LYNDAL CURTIS: So you don't think in this case the satirists have gone too far?

RICHARD MARLES: As I say I think it's a matter for them and it is their job to push the  envelope. I do think that there is some dignity in the flag and the office, but ultimately as Barry said  it's a judgement for the viewers.

LYNDAL CURTIS: And finally the opinion polls have shown the government has just over a  quarter of the support of those who were polled. Barry, there is though a question about Tony  Abbott; whether he's too negative. While the opposition has supported the government on a few  things doesn't that asylum seeker decision risk Mr Abbott continuing to be seen as negative and  does he need to change that.

BARRY HAASE: I think that question is irrelevant, if they may, I think the most important factor  of that latest poll is that if there was an election held now potentially all Labor seats could be wiped  out and The Greens and others would poll more votes. That's got to be scary for any pollster.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard, are you worried about your seat?

RICHARD MARLES: I'm not sure that's what the poll says, I never take my seat for granted that's  for sure. I'm constantly working in the electorate of Corio. But I would make the point we're doing  difficult things at the moment and we're clearly not doing them with a view to how it shows up in  the polls. We need to be putting a price on carbon, that's a difficult debate, but I'm sure in the  fullness of time people will see why we're doing it, the benefit of doing it and I think they'll make  their right judgement come election day.

BARRY HAASE: I wonder if the 1200 employees at Alcoa are going feel that way — putting their  jobs at risk with the introduction of a carbon tax that will cost the company an extra $40 million per  annum. Scary.

RICHARD MARLES: Well I've spent a lot of time working with Alcoa and Alcoa support action  on climate change. Alcoa are completely comfortable with the price on carbon that the Gillard  government has put in place. So there's a lot of overblown rhetoric here on the [indistinct].

BARRY HAASE: That has to be disputed, the announcement today is that it put both their plants  at risk with the high Australian dollar, high input costs and a carbon tax combined an additional $40  million there's not much — so much fat in the industry that they can [indistinct].

RICHARD MARLES: That's not the announcement today, that's just wrong.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Before the next election the carbon tax will be introduced and there'll be time  for people to see it. Do you think there's a chance that people's views might change?

BARRY HAASE: I don't believe so. I believe that their view will change in a more negative sense  towards the tax because the reality will start to come home. Very few companies have analysed the  fine print at this stage to find out just how great the negative impact will be.

LYNDAL CURTIS: And that's all, we'll have to leave it. Richard Marles and Barry Haase thank  you very much for joining us.

BARRY HAASE: Thank you Lyndal.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks.
