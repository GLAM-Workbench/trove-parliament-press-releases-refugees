Another Triumph for Pauline Hanson as PM Uses Fake Focus on Citizenthip  to Scupper Multiculturalism

Queensland Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett says the Prime Minister's own record shows his new  focus on citizenship is a fraud, and just a cloak for fulfilling another Pauline Hanson policy of scrapping  multiculturalism.

"To date the citizenship portfolio has been treated like left overs by Mr Howard, with the latest changes  meaning there have now been five different Ministers with responsibility for it in less than two and a half  years," Senator Bartlett said.

"Major improvements to the Citizenship Act were announced two and a half years and four Ministers  ago, but have still not been put through Parliament, while time has been wasted on shallow publicity  stunts like 'Aussie values' tests.

"Mr Howard's statement that 'immigration should lead to citizenship'is also totally inconsistent with his  own migration policies over recent years.

"People have to hold permanent visas before they can apply for citizenship, yet the Howard government  has promoted a massive increase in temporary migration; deliberately put refugees on temporary visas,  and recently decided to put in place disincentives for migrants to take up citizenship by doubling the  length of time people first have to be here.

"This is nothing more than an election year stunt showing up the narrow vision of Mr Howard and his  willingness to use shallow nationalism to achieve his fantasy of imposing a mono-cultural vision on the  reality of a modern multicultural Australia," Senator Bartlett concluded.

Ministers with responsibility for Citizenship from 2001:  Gary Hardgrave November 2001 to October 2004  Peter McGuaran October 2004 to July 2005  John Cobb July 2005 to January 2006  Andrew Robb January 2006 to January 2007  Kevin Andrews January 2007 onwards
