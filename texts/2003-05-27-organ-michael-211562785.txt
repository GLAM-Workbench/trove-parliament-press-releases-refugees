HOWARD DUCKS DETAINEE’S DAD

Terry Hicks, the father of Australian detainee David Hicks,  confronted Prime Minister John Howard across the House of  Representatives in Question Time this afternoon when  Cunningham MP Michael Organ asked if the Australian  government had ever requested his return.

“David Hicks has been held without charge in a cage by the US  military at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since January  last year”, Mr. Organ said.

“The Howard government’s treatment of this case is outrageous  and disgraceful”.

“Our government has extended full support to the denial by the US  of Mr Hicks’ rights as a prisoner of war under the Geneva  Convention.”

“This is an open repudiation of the rights of an Australian citizen.”

“Along with its flagrant breach of United Nations conventions  relating to the rights of children and refugees, the Howard  government’s treatment of Mr. Hicks is a further undermining of  fundamental democratic and legal rights”, Mr. Organ added.
