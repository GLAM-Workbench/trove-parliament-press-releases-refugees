E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

JOURNALIST:

Peter Dutton, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning, how are you Ray?

JOURNALIST:

Not bad. When is this meeting on about ‘07’?

PETER DUTTON:

The Cabinet meets later today, so obviously it will be one of the agenda items there  - but I think as the PM pointed out yesterday - it’s not the most important issue that  we’ll deal with today.

JOURNALIST:

I think I know how you are going to vote….and I think I know how Eric would vote if  he were in fact in the room, but he won’t be.

You’re back in Canberra today ahead of that Cabinet meeting and we’ve spoken  about that. I spoke to your colleague yesterday, or earlier this week, Scott Morrison,  he made the point then - just one final thing about Kevin Rudd - that Labor didn’t  back Peter Costello when he was keen to head up the IMF.

So there’s a precedent for all of this. It’s not a matter of Mr Shorten saying; ‘you’ve  got to fall into line because he’s an Aussie, you’ve got to support an Aussie’, it  doesn’t work that way apparently.

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, I think Bill Shorten is being pretty cute at the moment. I mean he was the  person who knifed Kevin Rudd and he was front and centre leading his colleagues’  revolt against Mr Rudd’s leadership.

I haven’t been contacted by anybody saying that they think it is a good idea for Mr  Rudd to become the UN Secretary-General. It’s not a big issue out there in the  community and I think people have made their own assessment, their own  judgement about Kevin Rudd; his conduct, his personality, his management style,  everybody knows him well and those that know him best - his colleagues, as Eric  Abetz and others have pointed out - they’ve been very publicly boisterous about  what they believe Kevin Rudd to be.

It’s a very different situation than somebody like Kim Beazley. We supported Kim  Beazley for the Ambassador’s role in the United States because he had very good  contacts with the Democrat Administration.

JOURNALIST:

And he’s not a bad bloke…

PETER DUTTON:

…and he’s a good bloke. He’s been out this week saying that he doesn’t think it is a  good idea for Kevin Rudd to stick his hand up and I think there are other Labor  leaders and Labor luminaries who have made similar judgements and ultimately it is  an issue for the Cabinet to decide and that’s the decision that will be taken I presume  later today.

JOURNALIST:

Okay. You met yesterday with the Prime Minister and appeared on media; two years  since the last successful boat arrival, Operation Sovereign Borders, 734 people, 28  boats have been returned.

You said yesterday people smugglers are still trying to organise boats to Australia  despite your hard line, but you manage to stop them apparently?

PETER DUTTON:

There is no question Ray. I think Australians are mistaken if they believe that the  people smugglers have gone away, that the boats wouldn’t restart tomorrow given a  chance and as I said to you as we discussed I think last week on the programme,  many of the people smugglers were up there talking with some of the people that  they think would pay money to get onto boats, that if there was a change in the  election, if there was a Labor Government elected they were going to put boats to  sea very quickly and it shows how we’ve said, over a long period of time; it’s very  important for the Prime Minister’s language, for my language to be consistent and we  have been consistent. We haven’t been divided.

Mr Shorten is still not fit for government because the Left of the party is still  vehemently opposed to turn-backs, to regional processing and to the policy that we  have got around stopping people coming by boat.

So, we need to do all that we can with the Australian Defence Force, with Australian  Border Force, with ASIO and our other partners to disrupt the ventures before they  leave Indonesia or Vietnam or Sri Lanka - wherever they might be coming from -  and this is a problem that we’re dealing with every day.

But my message very clearly yesterday was to say to the people smugglers; we’ve  got aerial surveillance, we’ve got satellite surveillance, we have obviously a lot of  assets at sea and we have disrupted these activities and it’s been one of the most  significant achievements of this Government, but the problem hasn’t gone away and  we are still dealing with it every day.

JOURNALIST:

Now the Prime Minister spoke to my colleague Alan Jones this morning about the  possibility of voters in Herbert going back to the polls and this was addressed with  Scott Morrison on Monday on the programme.

Labor’s Cathy O’Toole is still 30/35 votes ahead of Ewen Jones. The recount  continues, but it does put you in a precarious position governing and then trying to  find a Speaker that doesn’t affect that balance. Obviously if it stays the way it is with  Cathy O’Toole seizing that seat, it does make life much more difficult for you to  govern in your own right, surely?

PETER DUTTON:

Well not in the Lower House because obviously the majority is 76 and that’s what we  get and the Speaker Tony Smith, who has done a great job, he has the capacity to  cast a vote, a deliberative vote in those discussions - and that’s if we didn’t have the  support for example of the new Member for Mayo in Nick Xenophon’s team, Bob  Katter and the other Independents including Cathy McGowan from Indi.

So look, 77 is better than 76, but we can certainly govern and govern well with 76  and I’m confident that Ewen Jones can get up.

I think there is a likelihood of it going to a by-election because if it can be  established, as has been reported that these Army officers weren’t able to cast  votes, and that number is greater than that which has decided the outcome - so  greater than 34 or 35 - then there is a very great prospect - and that’s the precedent  that was set in the Mundingburra state by-election back in 1996 it would have been -  so this is an exact precedent actually in that court case where soldiers were on  deployment weren’t able to cast their votes and a Court of Disputed Returns ordered  a by-election in that instance.

So there is still a way to run I think on the Herbert situation. But Ewen Jones has  done a great job and he is a good local member so I hope, I really hope, that he can  retain that seat.



JOURNALIST:

Okay. Now we’ve got this latest attack in France and they confront the same  problems we do, although they’re much more grave in France than we’ve confronted,  but it relates to the judiciary both in France and in Australia.

You’ve got a bloke over there who’s under a terrorist watch, who’s tried to access  Syria on two separate occasions. He comes to the attention of the police and the  various spy agencies there. They put him before a court and some hand-rigging  judge, I presume from the left of politics over there who doesn’t think there is a  problem with terrorists, decides ‘oh no, we’re going to put an electronic bracelet on  him and we are going to track where he is - but we don’t need to know where he is  between 8:30am and 12:30pm’.

So at precisely that timeframe he and another bloke go to the church, they cut the  throat of the 80-year-old priest and then murdered themselves.

I mean, what do we do when we identify dangers in the community, be it in France or  Australia, and it’s the same as Man Monis. We have got the coronial inquest  continuing now - and I note that the Police Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner  have been called, as they probably should - but yet we have a Magistrate or District  Court judge who allowed this man bail on very serious charges; accessory to  murder, rape, sexual assault, a whole range of things and they kept letting him out.

I mean thank god we are not France. We feel terribly sorry for what they confront,  but we have the same inherent problem in the judiciary, Minister.

PETER DUTTON:

I mean it’s a barbaric act that we have seen in France. It’s just appalling and it won’t  be the first and it certainly won’t be the last of these sort of acts because we have  seen plenty of incidents already and there will be, in my judgement, this threat from  terrorism for at least a couple of decades and we will have to live with it as people in  Northern Ireland lived with it for a period through the 70s and 80s and as people  lived with it and still do today in the Middle East and this is why we need to have  strong laws in place.

It’s why the Prime Minister has spoken about having detention going beyond the  penalty imposed by the court where we think we’ve got a very serious threat,   somebody that might…having been charged with terrorism, come back out into the  community to commit another act or a more heinous act.

I think people recognise that the Prime Minister really is absolutely serious and  adamant that we need as a Government to do all we can to protect Australians.

My job as Immigration and Border Protection Minister is to be part of the national  security team so that we can protect Australians and where you see in France and  Germany people coming across borders in a way that they don’t in this country -  thank God in a way we are an island nation - but also that we’re vigilant in terms of  our border protection laws because in the modern age it is inconceivable that we can  allow people into our country where we haven’t properly verified their identity and  that’s the absolute bread and butter of my job and what the Department does every  day.

So we need to deal with those threats and hopefully prevent them before they  happen and if they do happen then the courts need to act in accordance with the  public view and that is that serious penalties need to be imposed.

RAY HADLEY:

Look we know you’re tough and I applaud your tough stance on border protection,  but there’s a story in The Courier Mail today about a Brisbane couple caring for a  little boy from PNG.

Craig Wells met the boy’s father when they worked on Manus Island. Craig and his  wife Karen, I don’t know the processes, but brought the two-year-old to Australia  when his birth parents said they could no longer care for him.

The case has now gone to the Admin Appeals Tribunal in an attempt to stop him  being sent back to Manus Island, are you across this case, has there been  application made to you for some sort of compassionate resolution?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray what happens is they go to the tribunal and the tribunal makes a decision, at  that stage there can then be Ministerial intervention, under the law I can’t intervene  before that.

But I just make a couple of points. One is that I deal with these sort of cases every  day and in many cases, particularly where children are involved, as we’ve  demonstrated in the past, we do have a compassionate approach and we do provide  support.

There’s another case that’s been in the media in recent days involving a little girl with  a disability. Now I haven’t seen the full facts, I’ve asked for an urgent brief on it and  in those cases on the facts as I’ve seen them reported, I would be very sympathetic  to that case and allowing that family to stay in Australia.

Sometimes there is a difficultly though around adoption cases, around cases where  there may be some ambiguity about how the child came to be in the care of an  Australian couple and in a sense some of these cases may be more reliant on  investigations by child services or by police and we would rely on that advice as  opposed to, without commenting specifically on this case, but if we had a case where  parents just turned up with a child that wasn’t theirs, they’re giving an account which   I’m sure in 99 per cent of cases is right - but we need to verify all of that because

there are issues around child trafficking, around circumstances where we just don’t  know what’s happened in another country and we need to know all the facts in these  cases - but they very emotive cases and on the face of it you want to help children  and as we know there are millions of people that want to come to our country,  including many from PNG that would want to see their kids raised and educated and  provided with healthcare in Australia.

So we need to find the right balance. But in those cases I need to probably rely  frankly on the advice of children’s services and the police before I can make a  judgment if it comes to that.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay as always, thanks for your time.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Ray. See you mate.
