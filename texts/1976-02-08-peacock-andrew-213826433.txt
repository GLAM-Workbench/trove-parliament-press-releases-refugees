'  The Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Andrew Peacock,   said today that he deeply regretted that the United Nations  Special Representative,  Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi,  had not been  able to proceed to FRETILIN areas of East Timor for talks with  representatives of that party. .

'  It had been the Australian Government's earnest hope that Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi should be able to reach these areas  and thus round off his mission,  he said. .  .

But the Special Representative had found it necessary  to call off his efforts following advice from FRETILIN that they  were unable to identify a secure venue in East Timor for a  meeting. There had in fact always been considerable doubts

about the security of most of the airfields which had from time  to time been mentioned as possible points of entry into the  FRETILIN zones.  This lack of security was finally confirmed  by FRETILIN itself in a message received by Telecom Darwin on

6 February.

The Australian Government recognises that in default  of the. necessary guarantees of safety to his mission the Special  Representative had no alternative but to terminate it. Â·

"The Special Representative has done everything that  could be reasonably expected of him. to establish contact with  FRETILIN'leaders",  Mr Peacock said.

.  The Minister also noted in this regard that the

Australian Government had done what it could to assist the UN  mission. Australian Government technicians had assisted  Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi and the Portuguese authorities in  verifying transmission from the Portuguese corvettes. The

difficulties of establishing contact with FRETILIN forces  later led the Government to offer the use of Telecom facilities.

It was to be hoped,  Mr Peacock said,  that the

Special Representative's inability to travel to FRETILIN areas  would not jeopardise the outcome of the United Nations mission.

He recalled in this regard that Resolution 384 of the  Security Council had charged Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi with the  task of visiting Timor to make an on-the-spot assessment of the  situation and to establish contact with all the parties of the  Territory. '  Ã¢ÂÂ   '

.  The Special Representative had visited Lisbon and

Jakarta for talks with the Governments there, and Dili and .   other centres in East. Timor for talks with the Pro-Indonesian  parties. ’  ,  ;

The failure to reach FRETILIN areas was clearly most. . '  disappointing. '  '  .

However,  Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi's visit to Darwin. .  would have been of some overall benefit to his mission. While  there, he had had talks with Mr Ramos Horta, FRETILIN spokesman  on .foreign affairs, and other members of FRETILIN.Â· .

.  These discussions would have undoubtedly enabled the Special Representative ,tore-acquaint himself with FRETILIN1s views  thelaitest developments in the Timor situation as well as tneir  aspirations for the Territory. It was to be expected that

these views would be.reflected in the report now to be prepared  by the Special Representative for the United Nations'  Secretary-  General. .

Mr Peacock said that it would then be for the Security  Council to take up the matter again and to decide, in the light  of Mr Wirtspeaie-Guicciardi1s report, what further steps might be  taken. .  .  .  .

.  The Australian Government, although recognising that . the timing, of the Council'  s meeting is a matter for its members,   hopes that the matter will be treated as an urgent one and that  the Council will resume consideration at an early date. .

.  "As on the last occasion when.the Council met on the question of Timor,  I shall instruct the Australian representative  in New York to seek permission to participate",  he said.

.  "  The Minister noted in conclusion that.prior to his departure.Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi had authorised him to.say that  the Australian authorities had responded co-operatively and  promptly to all suggestions made by the visiting United Nations Â·   mission in. regard to communications between FRETILIN representatives

in Darwin and on Timor. .
