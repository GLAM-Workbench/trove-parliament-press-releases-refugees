TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL 10 MORNING NEWS - PENNY WONG AND  SCOTT MORRISON

SUBJECT:  IMMIGRATION; CARBON PRICE; FLOOD LEVY PACKAGE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



JOURNALIST:  Joining us in our Sydney studio this morning for our regular political debate  is shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison and from Adelaide this morning we have  Finance Minister Penny Wong as well.

Scott, if I can start with you first of all, the new immigration detention centre has just been  opened in Darwin - 1500 beds. We had the Pacific Solution. Is this the Darwin Solution? Is  this an admission by the Federal Government that it’s failed to stop the boats?

MORRISON: It’s an inevitable consequence of over 10,000 people arriving on more than  200 boats. The Government has announced 4,900 additional beds in our detention network  just since the election. I mean, they’ve announced and opened more beds than they have in  public hospitals. And I don’t think that’s a good record. There’s one reason for it, their  border protection policies have failed and this is the inevitable consequence of that.

JOURNALIST: Senator Wong, is it an admission that you’ve simply failed to be able to  stem the flood of people coming down from the north?

WONG: This is a centre which enables us to make sure we can rationalise some of the  detention facilities that people were staying in like motels, including when John Howard was  in power. It’s a sensible solution to make sure we can continue to maintain our mandatory  detention arrangements and to get families and vulnerable people into the community but to  maintain the mandatory detention regime.

Can I say in response to Scott’s slogans again, let’s remember the primary reason why  people move countries and try and go somewhere else is what’s happening in their home  country. That’s when the numbers go up. And we see that now. We see people flowing into  Italy because of what’s happening in North Africa. That’s the reality.

Scott does have a lot of slogans. He doesn’t tell people that the Howard Government spent  hundreds of millions of dollars for example on Nauru. And most of those people came to  Australia anyway. The primary reason why people leave countries and go to another  country or seek to go to another country as an asylum seeker is because of humanitarian  crises in their home country. We saw 43 million displaced people in 2009. That’s the  context of the Australian debate.

MORRISON: There’s been 10.4 million refugees around the world in the last few years.  And that’s actually the same as it’s been now for many, many years. Penny likes to talk  about the cost. On this program just a week ago, I pointed out that this Government asked  for another $290 million just for this year for asylum seeker management. Now that is more  than the running cost for the entire six years of the Pacific Solution. She denied it a week  ago. But I produced the evidence of a statement of Senator Evans in February 2008. That’s  the comparison of the cost. When you have that many people come Penny -

WONG: That’s just wrong, Scott -

MORRISON: Penny, read the document.

WONG: You’re just wrong. I mean, you’re just wrong.

MORRISON: $289.5 million for Nauru.

WONG: I know you want to run these slogans, Scott. You’re just not telling people, you’re  not telling people the truth -

MORRISON: You can’t just say it’s not true and not produce the evidence, Penny. I  produced the evidence to back up my claim. You produce your evidence.

WONG: And what I’m saying to you is we know that the Nauru solution that you put in place  cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

MORRISON: It cost $289.5 million. That’s true. That was your figure.

WONG: Well the Nauru solution cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

MORRISON: $289.5 million it cost.

WONG: What I am saying, if I could just finish this sentence please, what I’m saying is this.  I know you want to pretend there is a simple solution. I know you want to run another  slogan campaign. That’s all that the Opposition does.

MORRISON: No I want to fix your failed policies, Penny. That’s what I want to do.

WONG: Let me finish please, Scott. Let me finish, Scott. What I am saying is this is a  problem. This is a public policy problem and we have to remember that the context of this is  millions of displaced people around the world. That’s the primary push factor. That’s the  primary push factor for people to come to Australia. That’s the context for this debate. I  know the Opposition want to pretend that isn’t the context. But that is the international  context of the debate.

MORRISON: Well the facts don’t back it up, Penny. 200 boats, 10,000 people since you  started relaxing the policy. 6500 people in the detention network -

WONG: And the facts don’t -

MORRISON: Now let me finish this time, Penny. More than 50 per cent of those people  there for more than six months. That’s your record. You put the asylum freeze in place  which increased the amount of time people spent in detention. That was a discriminatory  asylum freeze which discriminated against Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers. That’s  the only discriminatory immigration policy I am aware of that has been introduced -

WONG: You are sounding more and more shrill.

MORRISON: You can talk over me if you like, Penny, but you don’t seem to want to be able  to confront the facts of you own failed Government’s policy. You just say it’s wrong but you  can’t back it up. Our policies led to less than 300 people arriving in six years. You’ve had  more than 10,000 in two and a half years. The Australian people understand that.

JOURNALIST: Alright, let’s hear from the Senator. Senator, yes?

WONG: Well we can spend the entire time talking about this, which I’m sure Scott wants.  But what I would say again is this. The primary reason why people leave countries is what’s  happening in their home country. Scott talks about their solution. We know many boats  arrived under John Howard. We know that the Temporary Protection Visa arrangements  didn’t stop people coming. And we know his policy also cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

So Scott can, you know, in a very shrill way keep having this argument. I think what people  deserve is a calm measured discussion about what is an international problem. We are  working through a regional solution and we are also ensuring we have proper detention  arrangements in place. I think that is a more sensible discussion than the way in which  Scott wants to approach it today and always.

JOURNALIST: Alright let’s move onto another subject for the moment. We seem to have  growing evidence, Senator, of a Labor backbench caucus - if you like - revolt over the deals  that the Government is now doing with the Greens and the independents where your  backbenchers are actually fronting up to the cameras and voicing their concerns?

WONG: I don’t think that’s a fair assessment of what’s occurring. What we’re doing when it  comes to, for example, the climate change debate is working through a Multi Party  Committee. Yes, that includes the Greens. It also includes Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott.  And the reason we have to work with them is the Opposition, despite previously supporting  action on climate change, now simply says no, we don’t want to do anything, and is running  a fear campaign.

We think it is a responsible economic reform. We want to work through this in a sensible  way. We are talking to other parties including yes, the Greens, yes Mr Oakeshott, yes Mr  Windsor. We would be happy to talk to the Opposition if they wanted to actually participate  in this discussion but they don’t. They just want to run a scare campaign and a  fearmongering campaign on this issue which is so important to Australia’s future.

JOURNALIST: But Senator, your own backbenchers are fronting the cameras and claiming  this?

WONG: I think there’s always going to be some debate about issues. What I want to make  very clear is we’re the Labor Party and we govern with Labor values. We’re also a minority  Government and we have to have discussions with other parties and other individuals to get  our legislation through.

An example is yesterday we saw Senator Xenophon agree to support the flood levy to back  the rebuild in Queensland. But I think there is a question here of why are we in the position  of having to negotiate legislation with Senator Xenophon, or the Greens, or Mr Oakeshott,  or Mr Windsor? We’re happy to do that, but why are we in that position?

JOURNALIST: Good point. Scott Morrison, why be so obstructionist?

WONG:  The Opposition has just thrown things down and walked away.

JOURNALIST: How do you answer that? Why be so obstructionist?

MORRISON: We’re going to oppose this great big tax based on a great big lie. This Prime  Minister -

WONG: You used to support it Scott.

MORRISON: I let you speak there for quite a long time.

WONG: You used to support it.

MORRISON: OK I’ll let you go again if you like. Before the last election -

WONG: You were one of the people backing Malcolm Turnbull and you used to support it.  You had a change of position.

JOURNALIST: Let’s hear from Scott.

MORRISON: If you’d let me answer. Before the last election we all know the Prime Minister  said there would be no carbon tax. The Treasurer described the claim that there would be  as hysterical. She’s walked away from that commitment and she wants to walk away from  the debate on it now. We oppose a carbon tax. We think we’ve got a better way with our  direct action plan which addresses a whole series of issues, which Penny also knows can  work. We’ve also said very clearly we oppose more taxes when we think the savings can be  found in the budget. Now this Government doesn’t want to find savings, doesn’t want to  make hard decisions, whether it’s on this or on border protection or anything else. They just  want to tax, tax, tax. And this great big new tax, on the carbon tax, is based on a great big  lie. And the Australian people have found this Government out on this and they’re frankly  sick of it.

JOURNALIST: Can I just touch on one other subject while we’ve got everyone here this  morning.

WONG: Can I just respond to something here.

JOURNALIST: Yes, sorry.

WONG: I just want to respond to something Scott’s said. First, he talks about his policy.  First, it doesn’t work. Second, it will cost $30 billion. That comes out of - let me finish  please - that comes out of the pockets of Australian families. So the Opposition is going to  put their hands into the wallets and purses of Australian, take $30 billion out over the next  ten years. That’s their policy. The other point I’d make is this: Scott used to support this. He  now doesn’t.

MORRISON: I’ve never supported a carbon tax.

WONG: The only thing that’s changed is the politics.

MORRISON: I never supported a carbon tax.

WONG: You supported a price on carbon.

MORRISON: I have never supported a carbon tax, Penny. Ever.

WONG: You supported an emissions trading scheme under Malcolm Turnbull.

MORRISON: You seem to forget Copenhagen. You were there. You remember it. You don’t  seem to want to talk about Copenhagen now. A lot has changed since then, Penny.

WONG: I’m happy to talk about it.

JOURNALIST: One other subject just to broach while we’re here. The flood tax for  Queensland. Clearly there’s going to be a problem by raising a fee off the rest of Australia  to pay for damage in a state that simply didn’t insure its own assets. Why not just put this  through as a budget measure, Senator, rather than reaching out to the people?

WONG: We have funded two thirds of this package from savings measures, from cuts to  expenditure. And we think that’s the responsible way to go. Let’s remember this is the most  costly natural disaster that Australia is likely to have seen. I think all of us who watched  what happened or lived through it, for those people who live in Queensland - we saw the  enormous devastation, the enormous destruction. That’s an enormous amount to rebuild.

We’re very pleased that we’re able to negotiate passage of this legislation. It’s about giving  certainty to Queenslanders as they rebuild. We’re serious about that. And we think that’s  the right thing to do.

JOURNALIST: Is it fair for the rest of Australia, Scott?

MORRISON: We don’t think the tax should be introduced. We think the savings should be  found in the budget. And I think Australians fell for a government that wasted $2 billion on  pink batts, that has overspent their budget on border protection by a billion dollars; that this  Government just simply hasn’t got the right to go to the Australian people and say, look, we

can’t stop spending money, so we’re just going to have to ask for more taxes. Of course  we’re all committed to the reconstruction effort in Queensland, that’s not an issue. What’s at  issue is that this Government wants to tax and the Coalition doesn’t.

JOURNALIST: Senator, one last word before we go.

WONG: I’d just make the point that the Coalition’s own policy on this doesn’t add up. They  haven’t found the savings to fund this. So really what Scott has said is not accurate.

MORRISON: You’ve never tried.

WONG: If you’re serious about rebuilding Queensland, then you have to put forward a  sensible package. The Opposition hasn’t done that. The Government has. And the reason  is we are determined to help Queensland communities rebuild from this terrible disaster.

JOURNALIST: Alright, thank you very much both of you again for coming in on our weekly  debate. Minister Penny Wong and shadow minister Scott Morrison. Thanks again.
