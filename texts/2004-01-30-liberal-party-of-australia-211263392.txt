Latham's Black Hole Growing

VPS 028/2004

Whether it is economic ineptitude or simply playing fast and loose with the truth, Mark Latham's claim that the Pacific  Solution has a 'half-a-billion dollar cost' is simply wrong.

How can the Australian public trust Mr Latham to manage the economy if he can't even read the Budget Papers properly?

The Australian Government has spent around $165 million since 2001-02 on Nauru and Manus.

That's a long way from Mr Latham's half-a-billion dollar claim.

If Labor are hoping to save a few hundred million by closing down the Pacific Solution, then they have rocks in their head.

There is no magical windfall here to pay for Mr Latham's extravagant promises.

Mr Latham also seems to be ignoring the flow on costs of closing down the Pacific Solution. His policy of processing onshore  has significant costs and will give asylum seekers access to our generous court system. Where is he expecting to relocate the  rejected asylum seekers already on Nauru?

Incredibly, Mr Latham still cannot grasp the fact that the introduction of offshore processing has had a major impact on the  people smugglers business. By abolishing the Pacific Solution, Labor will be giving the people smugglers the green light  again.

Labor's policies on immigration will put the people smugglers back in business and start the flow of asylum seekers towards  Australia again.

Mr Latham needs to start thinking about how Labor will pay for the millions of dollars involved in processing this influx of  asylum seekers.
