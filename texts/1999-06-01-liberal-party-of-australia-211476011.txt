to the MRT, he expects to make further rounds of appointments in June 
to bring the number of MRT members up to its full complement. One member 
will be based in Brisbane and at least one member will be appointed 
in Perth.

Â

“These appointments will bring a wealth of experience 
in administrative review to the MRT. Many have served with the Immigration 
Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal, and all have enjoyed 
distinguished professional careers in the Australian community”.

Â

In addition to the MRT appointments, Mr Peter Molony 
has been appointed as a part time Member of the RRT from 28 May 1999 
to 31 January 2001.
