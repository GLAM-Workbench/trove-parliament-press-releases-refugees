TIMOR

Safety questions and the uncertainties of the security  situation would preclude the sending of any Australian aircraft  into the war zones in Timor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  the Hon. Andrew Peacock, said today.

Mr Peacock was commenting on suggestions that  Australia might fly the United Nations special representative, Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi, into FRETILIN-held areas in East Timor.

He said that the Government was unwilling to risk  allowing Australians, Â·  or their aircraft, to visit areas where  safety could not be' guaranteed.

Nevertheless, he said, the Government hoped that  acceptable arrangements could be made for the United Nations  special representative to visit FRETILIN areas and to make  contact with FRETILIN leaders in East Timor. Australia's .   Ambassador in Indonesia had been asked to reinforce this view

in Jakarta.

One possibility might be for the Indonesian authorities  to fly Mr Winspeare-Guictiardi to the offshore island of Atauro,  and then for him to be taken into the FRETILIN zone by one of the  two Portuguese corvettes still in the area. Mr Peacock said that  this suggestion was being conveyed to Mr Winspeare— Guicciardi in  Jakarta.

Both of the Portuguese corvettes in the Timor area  also had powerful radio transmitters that could presumably enable  easy contact to be established with FRETILIN. This suggestion  too had now been conveyed to the United Nations special representa

tive in Jakarta.

There was therefore no basis to allegations that  Australia was frustrating the mission of the United Nations  special representative, he said. If Portugal still claimed to  be the legal controller of East Timor, then it was incumbent on

it to play a positive role.
