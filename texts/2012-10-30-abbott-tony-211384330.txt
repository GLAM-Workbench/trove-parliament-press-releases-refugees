TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here in Holt in Canberra. I want to thank Carers ACT and their CEO Dee McGrath for  making Mitch Fifield, the Shadow Minister for Disabilities and Gary Humphries, the ACT Senator and the  former Chief Minister and myself so welcome at the Uniquely Us cafÃÂ©. This is a marvellous venture of  Carers ACT designed to ensure that as far as is humanly possible youngsters with a disability can integrate  into our community - particularly the world of work in our community.

As you know, I’ve had quite a lot to do with carers, particularly since Pollie Pedal was raising money for  Carers Australia earlier in the year. I’m thrilled that Pollie Pedal next year will also be raising money for  Carers Australia. Naturally, through my contact with carers I’ve become particularly conscious of the  importance of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The carers of Australia want funding certainty for  this scheme and the best way to ensure that the NDIS has funding certainty is to get the budget back to  strong surplus as soon as possible. I regret to say that this is highly unlikely, indeed, becoming increasingly  impossible under the current government. The current government is crab-walking away from the promised  surplus. Having promised again and again and again to deliver a surplus, this is a government which is  preparing the ground to abandon yet another solemn commitment to the Australian people.

In the mini-budget last week we saw that the mining tax, which is supposed to raise $2 billion now, raised  nothing in the first quarter. We saw in the mini-budget last week a $1.2 billion blowout in border protection  expenses. Every boat that arrives costs the budget $13 million. We’ve had 16 boats in the last week. That’s a  $200 million-plus hit on the budget, just from border protection blowouts alone.

So, this is a government which is never, ever - never, ever - going to deliver an honest surplus; which is  preparing the ground for a humiliating public abandonment of the surplus and the only way to ensure that we  do get a responsibly delivered National Disability Insurance Scheme is to change the government because  only the Coalition can be trusted with the public finances of our country.

QUESTION:

So, will you support these saving measures then announced in the mini-budget?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will do what we always do when we see the legislation. It will go through our normal Party processes  and we’ll announce what we’re going to do.

QUESTION:

But you would weigh the National Disability Insurance Scheme as more important than some of those  savings measures that they have announced, therefore, would you put priority?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s very important that we have the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Coalition fully supports the  funding commitments that the Government has already made to the NDIS. We enthusiastically support the  funding commitments that the Government has already made to the NDIS but in order to deliver funding  certainty, the Government has to make further commitments and the best way to ensure that these  commitments can be made is to get the budget back into surplus.

QUESTION:

On asylum seekers, is the Coalition going to support the Government’s attempts to excise the Australian  mainland from the migration zone so that boat arrivals can be sent to Nauru and Manus Island?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, we’ll wait and say exactly what we’re going to do when we see the relevant legislation. I haven’t  seen any legislation. I understand the Government had a huge argument in the Caucus about this this  morning. Let’s wait and see what the Government comes up with.

QUESTION:

Do you think the Government are just hypocrites when it comes to asylum seekers? I mean, this was a  Howard Government-era policy, you know, they seem to be going back to these ideas.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is a government which doesn’t have its heart in it when it comes to offshore processing.  Something like 7,000 illegal boat arrivals have taken place since the Government first started to commit to  put people into offshore processing and yet only a few hundred have gone off to Nauru. So, this is a  government which is simply failing to keep even its own commitments when it comes to offshore  processing.

QUESTION:

Will the Coalition be supporting Labor’s water reforms and was the issue discussed in the Coalition Party  Room meeting this morning?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t go into the details of what happens in the Coalition Party Room but there is only one water bill  currently before the Parliament. My understanding is that the Government is prepared to support the  amendment that the Coalition sought and therefore that bill will be going through the Parliament.

QUESTION:

Has Peter Reith got a point? Why do you know better than the local preselectors in Robertson and Dobell?

TONY ABBOTT:

The party has chosen two excellent candidates and I’m very happy to be campaigning with both of them.

QUESTION:

That wasn’t the local preselectors, though, who chose those candidates. Why were they overruled?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, the party has chosen two excellent candidates and I’m very happy to be campaigning with both of  them.

QUESTION:

What do you make of Cory Bernardi? He’s number one on the Senate ticket in South Australia. Would you  be intervening with him given what’s happening with Don Farrell and Penny Wong?

TONY ABBOTT:

The truth about the Labor Party is that the faceless men are in charge. The faceless men give. The faceless  men take. The faceless men are always in control.

QUESTION:

This is the criticism that Peter Reith is making of you, though, saying the Liberal Party is in danger of  becoming exactly that, if the executive, if the leader, takes the rights of local committees to select their  candidates away.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s simply not true.

QUESTION:

There are reports that workers at the Nauru detention centre are getting paid $4 an hour. Do you think that’s  fair?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a matter for the Government and, as I said, the Government just doesn’t have its heart in the whole  offshore processing policy.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, given that Simon Birmingham is a parliamentary secretary, should he be above Cory Bernardi on  the South Australian Liberal Senate ticket?

TONY ABBOTT:

At the time that the preselection was finalised, Senator Bernardi was higher in the standing order than  Senator Birmingham but the difference between the Labor Party and the Coalition is that when it comes to  power inside the Labor Party, the faceless men are always in charge and you don’t have to take me on this -  look at what the Labor Party’s own members are saying. Look at what Maxine McKew is saying about real  power inside the Labor Party. You don’t have to believe me; believe Maxine McKew, who knows what  she’s talking about inside the Labor Party. She knows the faceless men are running the show. She’s told us  that Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, owes her position not just to people like Don Farrell but even to  people like Michael Williamson, the former National President of the Labor Party and the now disgraced  head of the Health Services Union. These are the people calling the shots inside the Labor Party. This is why  it was actually Anthony Albanese, and not Julia Gillard, who exercised leadership in the matter of the South  Australian Senate ticket.

Thank you.
