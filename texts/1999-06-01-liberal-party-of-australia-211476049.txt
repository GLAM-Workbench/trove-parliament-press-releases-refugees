PROGRESS OF OPERATION SAFE 
HAVEN

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced that Bandiana in northern  Victoria will be deployed 
as a safe haven for Kosovar displaced people, with the evacuees to be 
accommodated at the site from late June.

Â

The decision to deploy Bandiana as an accommodation 
centre completes announcements on facilities to be used as safe havens.

Â

“The selection of safe havens has depended largely 
on their state of readiness, the cost of upgrading and the cost of providing 
health and social support services on site,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

"The Government has also decided to increase 
the cash allowances for Kosovar refugees.

Â

“The allowance for adults has been increased by 
over a third, to $27 a week, while the allowance for children under 
12 has been doubled to $10 a week. Children over the age of twelve receive 
the adult allowance.

Â

‘The higher amounts both recognise the value of 
the comprehensive range of accommodation and support services provided 
at safe havens and also the need to give individuals some freedom of 
choice.

Â

“Donations and offers of assistance from members 
of the public are being made to voluntary welfare bodies engaged in 
the operation. The Corporate Sector is also assisting, and can provide 
further help through the Safe Havens in their region.”

Â

The Minister expressed thanks for all the offers of 
assistance and for the tremendous efforts made by voluntary and other 
agencies.

Â

‘The generosity shown by a wide cross section of 
the Australian community is a heart-warming expression of the national 
character.”
