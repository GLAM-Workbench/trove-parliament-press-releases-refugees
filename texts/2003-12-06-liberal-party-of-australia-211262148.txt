MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER  FA153 6 December 2003

VISIT TO INDONESIA

I will visit Indonesia from 7 to 8 December to attend the Council for Security Cooperation in  the Asia Pacific (CSCAP) general conference. I will also hold a range of bilateral meetings  with senior Indonesian figures.

My visit to Indonesia will focus on Australia’s successful cooperation with Indonesia to  combat terrorism in our region. In a successful joint investigation, the Indonesian National  Police and the Australian Federal Police have captured and brought to justice most of those  responsible for the Bali bombings.

Indonesia and Australia will foster further co-operation in the region through the regional  ministerial conference on counter-terrorism that I will co-host with Indonesia’s Foreign  Minister Hassan Wirajuda in February 2004.

On this visit I will meet with the Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political and Security  Affairs Bambang Yudhoyono, Foreign Minister Wirajuda, Police Chief Da’i Bachtiar and  other senior figures in the Indonesian Government.

At the CSCAP conference, I will detail the extent of our regional counter-terrorism  cooperation. I will also emphasise that the Australian Government does not associate the  overwhelming majority of Muslims with the extremists who present our current challenge. I  agree with most Muslims that extremist Islamic terrorists are wrong when they claim that their  religion justifies acts of indiscriminate destruction.
