THE HON. JASON CLARE MP  CABINET SECRETARY   MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS  MINISTER FOR JUSTICE



TRANSCRIPT  Interview with Fran Kelly  ABC Radio National Breakfast  4 March 2013



FRAN KELLY:                    Well as you've heard, Julia Gillard has begun her five  day trip to Western Sydney, and she'll spend the next few  days outlining her vision for the area, and for the nation.  Last night the PM outlined a plan to party members at the  University of Western Sydney, and top of her priority list:  jobs, education, fast broadband and assisting modern  families. And a plan to make the community safer by  cracking down on organised crime.

The Prime Minister will establish a national anti-gang

taskforce based on a successful model used by the FBI in  the US. This $64 million taskforce will target cross-border  organised crime, with assistance from a range of  agencies including the Australian Crime Commission,  Customs and Centrelink.

Jason Clare is the Minister for Home Affairs, he's also

the member for the Western Sydney seat of Blaxland.  Minister, good morning, welcome to Breakfast.

JASON CLARE:                 God morning Fran.

FRAN KELLY:                    Follow the money, that seems to be the main goal of this  taskforce. What can, and will, this taskforce do?

JASON CLARE:                 Well, you're right it is about following the money. I've  spoken to a lot of police in Western Sydney over the last  few weeks, from Blacktown to Bankstown. They make the  point that it's all about money, you've got gangs shooting  at each other over turf to sell drugs, but ultimately it's  about the money that you make. And there are two  things, if we can give police more power to seize their  assets, seize their cash and their homes, that makes a  difference on the street, but also the work that Federal  Government organisations, like the Tax Office and  Centrelink can do to help give extra information to state  police investigation, can really make a difference on the  street.

So, in putting together this gang taskforce, we've been

very keen to make sure that we don't just have the state  police and the Federal Police, but also have the Tax  Office, Centrelink and Immigration there, all working  together. What the Police Commissioner said yesterday is  this is the way to fight crime.

FRAN KELLY:                    The Federal Opposition had labelled it initially a stunt,  and says cross-border cooperation's already happening,  and cross-agency. Don't we have state and Federal  Police and the Australian Crime Commission, and  Customs for that matter, already working together?

JASON CLARE:                 We do, and we do it at the border. You might know about  Taskforce Polaris, we spoke about it last year. And that's  been very successful, that's state police and Federal  Police working at the border, they've made a lot of arrests  and seized a lot of drugs. But this is the next step, doing it  on the street.

You would've seen, last week, that massive seizure of

ice, the biggest in Australia's history, about half a billion  dollars worth of drugs seized. And that was the state and  Federal Police taskforce working together. We've got to  apply the same model on the streets of Sydney and  Melbourne and Brisbane, and if we do that we can be

more successful in locking up the people that are  shooting at homes, and also seizing their assets.

FRAN KELLY:                    And when you say on the street, what do you actually  mean. I thought that police, the local police, that was their  job to do it on the street. Are you talking some kind of  Eliot Ness force here?

JASON CLARE:                 What I'm saying is there are Federal Government  agencies that can help them do their job. What police are  telling me - extra gang intelligence, telling us what gangs  are doing right across the country is important, because  these people are part of chapters right across the country  and overseas. From an intelligence centre based in  Canberra, we'll provide more information, more  intelligence to do their job. Extra help from the Tax Office  and Centrelink will make it possible for their investigations  to be more successful. This taskforce will also look at  what Australian gangs are doing overseas, their links to  Asia, their links to Europe, their links to the United States,  because what they're pedalling on the streets of Sydney  and Melbourne and Brisbane is coming from overseas.

FRAN KELLY:                    And so talk to us some more about that, because some  of these bikie gangs, as you say, increasingly

international operations. What kind of proof do we have  that? What does that mean?

JASON CLARE:                 Well, I'm not going to foreshadow on the radio, Fran,  everything that the Federal Police know, but needless to  say, the gangs that are pedalling drugs in Sydney, and  we're talking about people who wear leather jackets and  people who wear suits as well, aren't just acting in  isolation. They're often overseas or talking to people  overseas, that have got very strong links to other parts of  the world. And so you can't fight this in isolation, you need  state police and Federal Police working together, but a  key part of this taskforce is also working with

organisations like Interpol and the FBI, because if we're

going to crack this, it's going to require everyone to work  together.

FRAN KELLY:                    This taskforce would need, obviously, cooperation with  the states, and we haven't seen a lot of that on a range of  issues lately. Have you got enthusiastic consensus here?  What kind of discussion did you have with the state  premiers and police ministers before you made this  announcement?

JASON CLARE:                 Yeah, that's a really good question, because this is about  working together, we're only going to be successful if the  police work together and the politicians work together.  The people out in my neck of the woods really don't care  whose responsibility this is, they just want the shootings  to stop. The Prime Minister spoke to Premier O'Farrell on  the weekend, and I spoke to Minister Gallagher and got a  great response. We've done some good work together  last year with the work we did tackling the illegal firearms  market and this is a logical next step and the Minister was  very supportive of the approach that we're proposing here  with the national taskforce.

FRAN KELLY:                    You're talking about your neck of the woods. You're the  Member for Blaxland, several of the recent drive-by  shootings have happened in your electorate. Is this aimed  directly at people in Western Sydney who aren't feeling  safe at the moment, and what are people in your  electorate telling you?

JASON CLARE:                 Well, it's very personal for me because these shootings  are happening in the streets I grew up in, and this is an  opportunity for me as a local member but also as the  Minister to do something about it. But I'm conscious that  this is not just a problem in Western Sydney. There's  been shootings in South Australia, there's been 14 in the  first few weeks of this year. There was a shooting in  Melbourne just over the weekend, and people's message  is the same. We don't care whose responsibility it is, just  fix it. When you've got shootings in the middle of the night

where kids are doing homework and people are laying in  bed, they don't want to hear politicians fighting. They want  action, and that's what this is about.

FRAN KELLY:                    You're listening to RN Breakfast, it's 18 minutes to eight  and our guest this morning is Home Affairs Minister Jason  Clare. Jason Clare, half the TV networks are

broadcasting from Rooty Hill today. Obviously you can't  control that, but has this Prime Ministerial visit to Western  Sydney become a bit of a circus? It certainly looks more  like an election campaign than anything else.

JASON CLARE:                 Well, as a boy from Western Sydney I'm glad we've got a  bit of attention. I know it's not true of you, Fran, but not a  lot of media often focuses on Western Sydney, so it's  good that we've got attention. I think it's great we've got  the Prime Minister out here. I represent the seat of  Blaxland, Paul Keating's old seat, and for 11 years John  Howard never visited the seat once. And, you know, my  view is Prime Ministers should get around the country,  see what life is like right across the country. That's what  the PM's doing, and the announcement she's making  today about putting over a billion dollars into the  completion of the M4 is the sort of thing that we really  need.

FRAN KELLY:                    Isn't it the sort of thing we usually get in an election

campaign too? A billion dollars for a motorway? That's - it  sounds like an election promise to me.

JASON CLARE:                 Well, it's something that's really needed out here,  something that should've been done a long time ago, but  people who live in Penrith or Parramatta, they get really  frustrated when the M4 finishes at Concord and then  you've got to fight your way through Parramatta Road to  get to the city where your studio is. The road should go all  the way there, and with that - a little bit like the

conversation we just had on crime - is going to require  the state government and the federal government to work  together.

FRAN KELLY:                    In a seat like yours, at Blaxland, most people are born  overseas or their parents were born overseas. What do  they take from the PM's message last night - we will put  Aussie workers first, we will stop foreign workers being  put at the front of the view - front of the queue?

JASON CLARE:                 Well, thank you for the question, because Blaxland's a  place that's got an unemployment rate double the national  average. A lot of people in Blaxland do it really tough. The  work that we've done over the last five years has helped  to make sure we didn't have a repeat of what happened  20 years ago when unemployment rates were up at 15 or  16 per cent. We've created close to a million jobs over the  last five years, and that's really important. The message  the Prime Minister was making yesterday is that this is a  party and this is a government which is focused on jobs  and jobs first. That's really good for my local area, it's  great for Western Sydney, but it's great right across the  country.

FRAN KELLY:                    Is this language getting pretty close to dog whistling,  though?

JASON CLARE:                 No, well, I think there's a very, very big difference  between the Prime Minister saying she supports creating  jobs in Australia and some of the things you're hearing  from the Opposition in the last few days.

FRAN KELLY:                    There are seven electorates in Western Sydney where a  minority speak - a minority of people speak English at  home. The Liberal Party has been pre-selecting migrants  and the children of migrants in this area. The last state  and local governments, they won - Auburn Council had a  migrant Liberal mayor, Smithfield an Iraqi-born Liberal,  the Liberal MP for Granville is Maronite. Labor's Federal  MPs across these seats are largely from Anglo  background. Are constituents going to identify more with  migrants as their candidates? Is this a problem for Labor?

JASON CLARE:                 I think if you have a look at all of the Labor members  right across Western Sydney, almost without exception  you'll find these are men and women who were born and  bred in Western Sydney. I can only tell you my personal  story, born and raised in Cabramatta, went to Cabramatta  Primary School and Canley Vale High School. I was the  first person in my family to finish school or go to  university, and so with people that know our area very  well, I sat in a classroom with kids from all around the  world because Cabramatta was a place where refugees  and migrants came.

And so I understand my community very well, and I

think it's the job of a local Member of Parliament to  represent everyone, people from different parts of the  world and different faiths.

FRAN KELLY:                    But surely also to reflect some of those? And if a minority  speak English at home, I mean, that's an experience you  don't have and many of your - most of your colleagues  don't have.

JASON CLARE:                 No, but it's your job and it's your responsibility to  understand that, and that means talking to people, it  means sitting in their lounge room, it means breaking  bread, understanding their issues and making sure that  they're properly represented in the Federal Parliament.

FRAN KELLY:                    Jason Clare, thanks very much for joining us on  Breakfast.

JASON CLARE:                 Thanks very much, Fran.

FRAN KELLY:                    Jason Clare is the Minister for Home Affairs. He's also,  as we were just discussing, the Member for the Western  Sydney seat of Blaxland.
