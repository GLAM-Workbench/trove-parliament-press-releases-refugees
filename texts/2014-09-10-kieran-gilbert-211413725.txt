E&OE TRANSCRIPT  INTERVIEW with KIERAN GILBERT- SKYNEWS AM AGENDA  WEDNESDAY 10 SEPTEMBER 2014

SUBJECT/S:  National Security, Government attempt to lower wages,  Children in detention

JOURNALIST - KIERAN GILBERT: Coming up on the show the Immigration  Minister Scott Morrison but first though live from Melbourne I’m joined by the  Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles, Mr Marles thank you very much for  your time, David Irvine’s comments suggest an increase in the terror threat is  now imminent, do you think Australians understand how real this risk is?

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION:  I think everyone who has been watching the videos  that have come out of Syria and Iraq can only be horrified by what they’ve seen,  and it is, it’s very scary and I think it is perfectly understandable that we would  hear the words that we have from the ASIO Director-General and it’s really  important that we take every measure we can to be as cautious and prepared as  possible for any terror threat and as we come to the eve of September 11. I  don’t think anyone needs reminding of how important it is that we take these  steps.

GILBERT:  Mr Marles ASIO has cancelled passports of those seeking to leave to  conflict zones, I guess the questions many Australians are asking, or the  question that they’re asking is why not allow these individuals to just leave, if  they want to leave why have their passports revoked and keep them in Australia,

and I guess the question is don’t they become an even greater risk if they  remain on home soil?

MARLES:  Well I don’t think it serves anyone to have Australians going over to  Syria and Iraq and participating in the appalling brutality which we have seen on  our television screens, and that can only have a really negative impact on those  people in the future and indeed anybody associated with them, and I think there  is a real question about how somebody such as Khaleed Sharrouf was able to  leave the country on his brother’s passport, notwithstanding that he was on a no  fly list, but all of this occurred under this Government’s watch, it is really  important that there is a real clear sense of who is going overseas and what they  are seeking to do and appropriate measures to take and to prevent that from  occurring.

GILBERT:  Now let’s look at some other issues now, the Immigration Minister’s  going to give a speech today and talk about relaxing the English language  requirements under this category, is it important, as much as of course we need  to make sure that there are jobs for the unemployed Australians, but if industries  don’t have enough skilled labour surely it makes sense to try and make that  happen through, if some of these requirements are too stringent?

MARLES:  Well Kieran it makes perfect sense to have in place a temporary  skilled migration program like the 457 program which is able to provide  employers with the skilled labour they need, so that they can help employ more  Australians.  Of course that makes sense, but it’s also important that this is not a  scheme which is exploited and that it doesn’t become an easy option to walk  down the path of cheaper labour, now when you look at the agreement that the  Government has put in place in relation to the Northern Territory which has as a  component of it, that people can be paid 10 percent less than the going rate,  that obviously raises questions and when you look at the issue of English  language requirements which the Minister is going to be talking about today. I  mean we’ve had no explanation from the Minister about why this is an issue, if  we’re talking about skilled migration programs, English is going to be an  important component for lots of jobs in some respects, it’s going to be an utterly  critical issue in terms of the safety on the job, but if there is a job out there  where English language requirements have got in the way of getting  appropriately skilled labour into the country, let’s hear the Minister give us an  example of that, and if he was serious about this, he would be releasing the  Independent Panel’s review into the application of the 457 visa program.

GILBERT:  Well he will be coming on shortly so I’ll put that very question to him  but the quote from the speech that we have seen is that he believes at the  moment they are too stringent, that they act like the industrial lock out as

opposed to having, ensuring appropriate language skills, are you open to his  convincing on this?

MARLES:  We’re obviously keen to have a look at what the Independent Panel  has to say and of course we will look at ways in which you can better improve  the 457 program, but for the Minister to suggest that speaking English and a  requirement to do so is the equivalent of an industrial lock out, this just doesn’t  pass the common sense test.  There are a whole lot of jobs where you’re going  to need to be able to speak English in order to perform them, and we haven’t  heard one example yet from the Minister of where the ability to speak English is  an unreasonable requirement in terms of getting skills in that are needed by  particular employers.

GILBERT:  Well I will ask him about that when he joins me shortly, but I want  to move on from the 457 visas now and look at the comments made by the  former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen suggesting that Labor would possibly  commit to removing the Immigration Minister as the guardian for unaccompanied  minors, asylum seeker minors, those in detention and so on, what’s your view on  that, should there be a separate guardian to that of the Immigration Minister?

MARLES:  Well we’ve seen this proposal emanate from the Human Rights  Commission, we don’t have a formed view on this yet, we are very open minded  to having a look at it. I guess we’d make a couple of observations and that is  that at the end of the day the Minister for Immigration is inevitably going to be  the responsible person in Government that makes that decision about who is in  detention and who is released from detention including in the situation of  children and I suppose what you wouldn’t want to have happen is for the  Minister to be operating in a set of circumstances where the requirement to take  a child’s best interests into account was in any sense watered down, so I think  they’re the sort of factors that need to be considered in having a look at this  issue but it’s an important discussion to have and we’ll continue to have it.

GILBERT:  Mr Marles appreciate your time as always, thanks for that.

MARLES:  Thanks Kieran.
