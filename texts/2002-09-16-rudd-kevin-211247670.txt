KEVIN RUDD M.P. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

[02-165]

MEDIA RELEASE

PRIME MINISTERIAL DOUBLE STANDARDS ON THE USE OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

Last year, the Prime Minister was happy to publicly read from classified Australian intelligence documents to the National Press Club in support of his pre-election contention that certain asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard.

This year, the Prime Minister suddenly seems reluctant to now provide relevant Australian intelligence information to the Australian Parliament and people to substantiate his Governmentâ€™s case against Iraq.

The Prime Minister contended in Question Time today in response to a question from myself that these were entirely separate matters.

Strange that.
