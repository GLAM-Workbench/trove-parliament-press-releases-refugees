RAY HADLEY:

Now, we spoke to Peter Dutton on Anzac Day. We spoke to him briefly, the Immigration,  Border Protection and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton from Gallipoli. He was attending  the Anzac Day commemorations. Obviously that was the focus of yesterday's chat. He joins  me now for our regular Thursday interview from Dubai, where it's about 3.30am in the  morning. Minister, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:



Good morning Ray. How are you?

RAY HADLEY:

Not bad. How have you pulled up?

PETER DUTTON:



I was dreaming of you and thought I'd give you a call…

RAY HADLEY:

What, you had a nightmare, woke up and thought; I'll ring Hadley.

PETER DUTTON:



In a sweat. I’ll give you a call at 3.30 in the morning, what else would I be doing?

RAY HADLEY:

Exactly. In Dubai, not much to do there at 3.30 in the morning. You were preparing to  represent the Government at yesterday's Gallipoli Dawn Service. Tell us about your  experience.

PETER DUTTON:



Obviously there's a number of international services; there are about six or seven services in  total that we attend. There's obviously a close collaboration with New Zealand and with  Turkey as well - it's got to be remembered that we're on their territory and they obviously  honour their dead as well - so there's a closeness in the approach, the respect that we have  for the fallen on both sides.

But the most striking thing is that, you know, the young backpackers and young Australians  who behave perfectly. They're on a pilgrimage. They're respectful and lots of older couples  as well who have got on their bucket list a desire to go to Gallipoli and they were finding it  very emotional as well yesterday. So it was a great honour to be there.

RAY HADLEY:

Have you caught up with the news that the Treasurer will scrap the Medicare levy that was  to be imposed? The 0.5 of 1 per cent increase which would've raised $8 billion to help fund  the NDIS. He's saying today, according to all reports, he hasn't made the announcement yet,  but it's going to go because the economy's looking okay and the Budget's looking okay.

PETER DUTTON:



Well I think the Treasurer will confirm that in his speech later on today.

Look Ray, I just think it underscores…there's a lot of commentary around about the  Government; we should be doing this, we shouldn't be doing that. The great strength of the  Coalition is that we manage the economy well and we keep borders secure, that we have  the strong focus on national security and you just don't see at a state level under Labor  governments - in Queensland at the moment they're putting on public servants, spending  money like it's going out of control, and they can't spend the money on either tax cuts or  road infrastructure; schools, education, whatever it might be.

So we have had to take tough decisions because we've inherited an enormous amount of  debt from Rudd and Gillard and we're working our way through getting the economy back  on track. If you do that, then you can reduce taxes, you can try and improve the  employment situation and provide stability in an economy where people want certainty,  particularly where there's global uncertainty.

So I think full marks to the Treasurer and to the PM. I think wherever we can reduce taxes,  that's a great thing.

RAY HADLEY:

Look, I know that I'm good at giving advice. I don't know that you're very good at accepting  the advice I give you, but I think it's been a very good week for the Prime Minister. The fact  that he's not here, you know, might play a role in that, but I think first of all - and I'm being  quite serious - he's performed well internationally in the UK then yesterday in Villers-Bretonneux. He's invited Tony Abbott to open the Sir John Monash Centre, which was Tony  Abbott's idea in part to start with. So, that gets him some plaudits for being the big man and  saying: well yes, Tony you come along - and I don't it's done him harm being photographed  with Tony Abbott for the opening.

But I just…this is my gut feeling, every time you and I talk, it's about: well look, if you want  to get rid of us, you'll end up with Bill Shorten, that weird dude Andrew Leigh, Tanya  Plibersek…

PETER DUTTON:



…weird cat. Weird cat.

RAY HADLEY:

A weird cat, I'm sorry. Weird cat. Sorry, I don't want to verbal you. That weird cat Andrew  Leigh, Tanya Plibersek, Chris Bowen, et. al. Now, you appear to be the only - and I use this  word respectfully, or this term - attack dog. Okay. You're the one that goes in hard against  the Opposition, but the negativity, not just from you, but from the Government generally  about: look, we mightn't be good, but by crikey, we're better than Shorten.

This idea is my idea alone. You've got a lot of disaffected, as you know, conservative voters  out there. Given that we have this peace between the Prime Minister and Tony Abbott -  and I don't know whether Tony Abbott would be agreeable to it - but I reckon you need  before you get to 33, or 34, or 35 Newspoll losses, you need a line in the sand. You need  some sort of seismic shift and I think inviting Mr Abbott back onto the frontbench, giving  him a portfolio of his choosing; you know a senior portfolio, would send a message out to  conservative voters that the wounds are healed and maybe you can move forward and then  you could focus with Abbott, you know, in the camp, not outside the camp on instead of  portraying the other mob as being hopeless, as you being actually good.

PETER DUTTON:



Well Ray, I think as you've demonstrated in the discussion around the tax cuts, I mean the  Government is getting some runs on the board and we're spending a fortune in Defence  acquisition, providing support to our troops, huge purchase in local manufactured Defence  industry, I mean all of all of those things; border protection, securing borders, there's great  good that the Government is doing. So I take issue with the thought that the Government is

not doing good. I don’t take any issue with the proposition that Shorten would be a disaster;  I think most people accept that. But look, positions in the Cabinet, they're an issue for Prime  Minister and those are issues for him.

RAY HADLEY:

Minister, I didn't expect you to say: Ray, that's a good idea, but you didn't actually answer  the question. I didn't expect you to say: you know what, that would be a great idea Ray, let's  make him Defence Minister and get rid of Marise Payne.

But I just think, seeing that all of a sudden, the Prime Minister is performing and you've got  this great announcement by the Treasurer today, why not seize the opportunity because life  is like this, Minister; in the early part of 2013, there was no thought of Julia Gillard going,  not in her mind - others were thinking about it - she got to 33 Newspoll losses in the June  and she was gone and Rudd came back and then got bashed up by your mob in September.

So I know that you resist at every opportunity your party, not you personally, but you resist  at every opportunity the thought of a change because you'd repeat the failures of Labor  with Rudd-Gillard-Rudd, but I just think that bringing the former Prime Minister back into  the fold would send a signal out to conservative voters right across the country that the  wounds have healed, things can move forward and he'd be part of the team that would fight  off the Labor challenge you all wish to fight off as the election draws closer.

PETER DUTTON:



Well Ray, honestly, I think people sort of see a lot of beltway discussion in Canberra. I think  most people want to see the policy and the outcomes for them, their families, small  business, whatever it might be and I think that the focus today is on the fact that we have  been running the economy well. We have made tough decisions right back to the time when  Tony put together his first Budget after the 2013 election. There have been decisions that  haven't been popular, but we've made decisions that ultimately are in the national interest;  have been able to allow us to reduce taxes. We want to continue to do that because people  are paying higher electricity bills, their cost of living pressures otherwise, particularly if  they're on a fixed income, as a pensioner or self-funded retiree.

So that's the focus and in terms of who does what job, as I say, it's an issue for the Prime  Minister and I really do think people want us to focus on jobs, on keeping the economy  strong, securing borders, etc, etc. So, you and the other fine commentators may comment  on these matters, but I'll leave it to you.

RAY HADLEY:

Alright. Just finally. Very quickly. Fifty six per cent of respondents to that Newspoll believe  the existing immigration cap of 190,000-plus is too high. Is there any chance that this could  be revisited? Because I think if Bill Shorten announced tomorrow he was cutting  immigration, which he won't, I think that would be the end of you as a party. I think that  would just seal his fate and your fate. Why don't you get in first?

PETER DUTTON:



But Bill Shorten is announcing that he's going to increase the number.

RAY HADLEY:

Yeah I know that. So you get in first and say: we'll decrease it and then you win the election  and you stay in the Ministry, as opposed to being on the Opposition frontbench.

PETER DUTTON:



But again, a couple of points; I mean the numbers have dropped compared to when Labor  was last in government. There's no question about that. The debate has been around  particularly whether people should be going to, you know, predominately Sydney and  Melbourne and the issue which you raised before about congestion on roads, in hospitals,  etc.

So there are a couple of points; you've got to try and move people out into regions. There  are plenty of regions where farmers want the abattoir to remain open so that they can get  their beef to market. They can't do that because Australians won't fill those jobs. So we've  got to get the balance right.

I think, frankly, the more productive debate is around who we're bringing in, whether or not  they're the right people, are they integrating? Are they working hard, paying taxes? And  nobody begrudges that. As long as you bring the right people in, I think that's the priority  and we've taken decisions about cutting the numbers back from where they were under  Rudd and Gillard, and Bill Shorten, as I say, is proposing to increase the number of refugees  that we bring in each year by quite a dramatic number. Now, that was their policy at the last  election, they haven't changed it and I suspect they'll continue on with it and under Labor,  you know, you'll get boats again.

So I think we've got the balance right. I understand the arguments and particularly the  sensitivities around capital cities, congestion, housing, affordability etc, but there are  economic arguments around the fact we've got an ageing population, we want younger  people paying taxes, and we've got to work on ways in which we can try to encourage  people to move out of capital cities to try and revitalise some of those towns.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Safe travels from Dubai. Thanks for your time.

PETER DUTTON:



Thanks, Ray. See you, mate.
