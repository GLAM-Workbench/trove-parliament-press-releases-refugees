PRIME MINISTER

FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4 1981

ELECTORATE TALK

During their deliberation over the Retreat, the Heads of  Government have decided to issue a declaration of their '  belief that it is imperative to reinvigorate the dialogue  between developing and developed countries as a matter of

urgency, and of their determination to contribute to that  process.

They have agreed on a declaration. It has one over-riding  purpose: to express as clearly and forcefully as possible,  the concern and commitment of the leaders on these issues.  Everything which might detract from the clarity of this  message has been deliberately omitted.

The declaration does not deal with specifics or with practical  measures. That is not its purpose. These, the issues of  trade, food, energy or finance, will be dealt with at length  in the communique at the end of the meeting. But because of

the intrinsic importance and urgency of the issues, and  because of the timing of the Melbourne conference in relation  to the North-South Summit in Mexico, the Heads of Government  think it essential to express now, and in unequivocal terms,  the importance.they attach to the mobilisation of the will  to make progress. rÂ·  Ã¢ÂÂ

It is possible to over-emphasise the importance of will and  commitment. But it is also possible - indeed very easy - to  underestimate them. They are essential ingredients for success.  It is just as much a moral and intellectual failure to surrender  to current realities in these economic and social spheres, as it

is to try to appease aggressors and tyrants in the political  sphere.

We have no right to accept gross poverty and inequality as  inevitable, until we have exhausted every possibility to  eliminate them,, and done so with vision and the utmost  determination, and without inhibition. That is the message of  the declaration. It comes from the Heads of Government of

41 countries, representing a quarter of the world's population.  It is a message to all the other governments of the world,  including especially the non-Commonwealth governments who will  be attending the Mexico Summit.  _

We shall be doing all we can - individually and collectively  to ensure that the message registers, and we hope it will  serve as an example and encouragement to other countries. It is also a message to the peoples of the world, rich and  poor: to the rich., that their own self-interest requires  action; to the poor, that the Commonwealth cares for their  plight and is determined to muster its weight to improve

their lot. .

The language of this declaration is not the language of  compromise or official caution. It is a powerful coherent  statement in language intended to appeal to the imagination  will and humanity of leaders and peoples. I commend it to  your attention.
