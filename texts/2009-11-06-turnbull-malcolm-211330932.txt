TURNBULL INTERVIEW WITH JON FAINE (774 ABC MELBOURNE) -  BORDER PROTECTION, TAXATION, GARY BANKS, REPUBLIC, GAY  MARRIAGE

The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP

Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

JON FAINE:

Malcolm Turnbull, welcome to 774 ABC Melbourne.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good to be with you.

JON FAINE:

Are you tweeting as we speak?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I have put in a little tweet just to alert the twitterers that I am here with you so they can listen to us on the internet

if they wish.

JON FAINE:

Are you obsessed with this new technology?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No, I’m not obsessed. I am bemused by it.

JON FAINE:

In what way?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I think it is interesting.

JON FAINE:

Why is it useful?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I think it is just another means of communication. As we were saying just a minute ago, the critical thing is the

message not the medium. So you have got lots of ways of getting your message across - radio, newspapers,

television, the Internet, Twitter, Facebook and no doubt many more that are yet to be invented. So if you are

spreading the good word, which is what I seek to do, you have to make sure you do it everywhere.

JON FAINE:

Tailor made for narcissists, I thought.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I think it is tailor made for people that want to get their message across.

JON FAINE:

And talkback radio is another way of doing that. 1300 222 774 if you have a question for Malcolm Turnbull.

The Prime Minister spoke to us yesterday about the standoff off Indonesian waters with the Oceanic Viking. What

would Malcolm Turnbull do in this situation if he was prime minister?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well what I would do is ensure that this phenomenon hadn’t occurred in the first place.

JON FAINE:

But it has. Given where we are right now, what would you do with it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, Jon, you can’t just take a snapshot in time. The reality is that Kevin Rudd has presided over a colossal

failure in policy. He unpicked the border protection policies of the previous government that were working, that

had seen no boats come for a long time or very few, and changed those policies and we have now had a surge in

people smuggling and unauthorised arrivals. He has outsourced our immigration.

JON FAINE:

He had a mandate to change, that was one of the key things he campaigned on in the election.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

He did not have a mandate to outsource our immigration policy to the people smugglers. That is what he did. He

didn’t tell the Australian people that. What he said to them was you can change the border protection policies and

it won’t make any difference. And that was always wrong, the Federal Police told him it was wrong, the

International Office of Migration told him it was wrong, even the Indonesian Ambassador gave a warning. He

ignored all that - let alone the Opposition of course; he always ignores us - but nonetheless he made those

changes and what do we have? Thousands, over two thousand unauthorised arrivals, a surge in people

smuggling, our immigration program is being outsourced to the people smugglers.

JON FAINE:

The Sri Lankans, of course, have fled a more recent conflict so it is unfair to say that this was something that

could have happened before the war came to an end.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well again, Jon, this is why - I will come to the position of the people on the boat in a minute - but I am reluctant

to give specific advice about what should be done with those people on the boat because I don’t have access to

the information that Kevin Rudd does. I don’t know who they are. I don’t know…

JON FAINE:

We know they’re Tamils.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well we know that but what we have also read reports is that they have been living in Indonesia for five years.

JON FAINE:

Some of them, yeah.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, is that true? We don’t know. See, this is the thing. As to how they should be handled on the boat, there is

no question, as a matter of international law, they were rescued at sea and they should… obviously we should

always respond quickly and urgently to people who are in distress at sea. They were rescued in sea in an

Indonesian search and rescue area, and quite properly they were taken to an Indonesian port.

JON FAINE:

Should they be escorted off our boat now?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well they certainly should leave the boat. The question is how to get them to leave the boat and, again, I don’t

want to give Kevin Rudd advice with a megaphone on that because I know no more than what I have read in the

press and what I have read in the press might not even be right. Now Kevin Rudd should know…

JON FAINE:

Given what you do know, given what you do know, we want to know as potential voters at an election maybe only

six, seven, eight months away from now how you would handle this standoff. We’re entitled to know, we need to

know.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Jon, if I was prime minister, I would be in a position to make a fully informed decision. I am not the prime

minister. I don’t have all that information any more than you do…

JON FAINE:

So you’re sitting on the fence, which means we don’t know how you would handle this.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Jon, that is absolutely wrong. Anybody making decisions as sensitive as this shouldn’t be making them unless

they have got all of the information. Now Kevin Rudd has all of that information. Clearly, the objective should be

to encourage or persuade them to leave the boat…

JON FAINE:

Would you force…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Again, I am not going to buy into that. I am not going to backseat drive Kevin Rudd on this particular issue. There

are security questions involved and a lot of information, classified information that he has that I don’t. He is the

Prime Minister. You had him here in the studio yesterday…

JON FAINE:

He was on the phone but either way.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Yeah okay, but you had him here. He is the guy with all of the knowledge on this, and he has got to make the

decision. The one thing Australians do know is that if I am prime minister, if we have an election, if we win and I

become prime minister, our border protection policies will be tougher and we will, over time, once again, as we

have done before, eliminate the people smugglers.

JON FAINE:

Okay. Can I just make it absolutely clear though, we still don’t know how you would handle this in any different

way to the way Kevin Rudd is handling it and we’re left not knowing then the difference between the way you

would deal with it and the way he’s dealing with it.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Jon, I don’t have the information that he has. With great respect, what you are saying is unreal. If Kevin

Rudd is prepared to sit down and brief me with all of the information that he has, I could express an informed

opinion, but any opinion I express about how he should handle… this is a tactical, people management issue

which depends particularly on who those people are, what do they have, what ages are they, what backgrounds

do they have. This is essentially a security assessment that has to be taken and can only be taken by a

government with all of the information to hand.

JON FAINE:

You can just as easily say none of those things matter because it is a question of principle. They either should or

shouldn’t be indulged on an Australian ship, in the words of some of the commentators. You don’t want to

[inaudible] this morning and we’ll judge accordingly.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well they certainly we shouldn’t have a vessel of that importance tied up there, sitting floating off Indonesia for

weeks and certainly the people on the boat should leave the boat. Now actually how that is effected, how they

are gotten off the boat…

JON FAINE:

Well the carrots have been tried and didn’t work so would you know force them off?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well again how that is done, Jon, is a delicate matter because it depends very much on an assessment of the

individuals on board and the consequences of using force.

JON FAINE:

Alright. I’ve exercised my best endeavours to force a clearer yes or no from you and I’ve failed so I will move on.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

You have tried to get me to make a completely uninformed judgment and I hope your listeners recognise…

JON FAINE:

We rely on it every day. What would we do without it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

…that I have resisted the temptation to make an uninformed judgment but clearly the principle is they should be

disembarked in Indonesia. How that is effected is obviously a fine judgment that can only be made by the PM

with all of the knowledge. It is his responsibility.

JON FAINE:

18 minutes to nine. Malcolm Turnbull is my guest in the studio this morning. There is talk now, Wayne Swan

yesterday unveiling what he says is going to be a ten year overhaul of the tax system off the review of the tax…

globally the Australian tax system. One of the major things is whether or not the wealthy are rorting

superannuation. Do you think they are?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I don’t believe so, no. I think the superannuation concessions are designed to encourage Australians to save

more and they have been successful in that extent. As a nation, we need to save more and the more Australians

are encouraged to be self-reliant and save for their own retirement the better.

JON FAINE:

So how would you finetune the tax system? What changes would you recommend? You drafted a blueprint for

Peter Costello that he didn’t seem to want when you were in opposition, in government.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well as a matter of principle, the aim should be to have a tax system that is simpler, so it is less complex, it is

fairer so that the people who are similarly situated pay the same amounts of tax and, of course, overall the level

of tax is lower because basically I believe as a Liberal that people should be entitled to keep more of the money

they earn, governments should be more careful with the way they spend money. The Rudd Government

unfortunately is spending recklessly and borrowing recklessly and that is inevitably going to lead us into higher

and higher taxes and interest rates. And you’ll see yesterday, Jon, that Gary Banks, who is the Chairman of the

Productivity Commission which of course is an independent government think-tank effectively on economic

matters, essentially echoed the same criticisms we’ve made all year of the Government’s economic policies.

Gary Banks said the stimulus needs to be scaled back, it is excessive and he said that the Government was

spending too much money without proper financial analysis, without proper cost-benefit analysis and, as a

consequence, if governments borrow money and spend it unwisely, it means that in the future, economic growth

will be lower, taxes will be higher and obviously we lose out.

JON FAINE:

Alright. It seems there’s little hope then of a bipartisan approach. 16 minutes to nine. We have invited callers.

There’s a full board, let’s get to them and I’m sure the republic will come up at some point. Alan in Sunshine.

Morning Alan.

CALLER:

Good morning Jon.

JON FAINE:

Go ahead.

CALLER:

Good morning Prime Minister! You keep going mate, you’ll be there.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Thank you very much Alan. That is very encouraging.

CALLER:

These people, these boat people, honestly, it’s not the Australians worry at the moment. I know they’re on one of

our boats but they are also in Indonesian waters. They are from Indonesia after all and they should be taken off

the boat by Indonesians. That’s the simplest way. The other way, with these people that are already here, they

should be taken away again back into Indonesia or wherever they come from and put through the legal system,

the legal system to come here.

JON FAINE:

Have you got a question Alan?

CALER:

Well that is it. Doesn’t he want to answer that or don’t you want to answer that, Jon?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well what is the question, Alan?

CALLER:

Well, don’t you think that these people are here illegally in the first place and don’t you think that they should

have been sent back and monitored back over there, wherever they come from, whether it be Indonesia, Sri

Lanka or wherever?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan, just legally, when an asylum seeker gets to Australia, we are bound by law to assess their refugee

status and then of course if they are found not to be refugees within the meaning of the UN Convention on

Refugees then they are sent home, that’s true. But we are not in a position legally under our law or even under

the UN Convention once people arrive to simply put them on a plane without assessing their refugee status. They

are entitled to have their claim heard. The problem that we have got, frankly, is that we had a set of policies -

some of which were controversial but the most criticised elements actually had been changed by the time of the

election in 2007 - we had a set of policies that worked, that had been developed over time, refined, amended

and they worked. There had been very few boats for a long time and Kevin Rudd just unpicked that recklessly

and what we have now got is a surge of people smuggling and, as I say, he is effectively outsourcing our

immigration program to the people smugglers who are crooks and it is an international criminal business and

these people are deciding who comes to Australia now, not us.

JON FAINE:

Alan, thanks for your call. Gino in Bayswater, morning Gino.

CALLER:

Good morning Jon. Good morning Malcolm.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Morning.

CALLER:

Malcolm, I had a question. I’m impressed how you weren’t blasÃÂ© with the comment but you do like to speak half

truths. Weren’t you not in Parliament last week when it was stated categorically that this boat people influx that

you are calling is a worldwide epidemic at the moment when up until about 2007 the worldwide epidemic had

ceased itself and it has nothing to do with John Howard’s boat people plan or Kevin Rudd unpicking it. Wouldn’t

you prefer to speak the whole truth instead of half truths?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I’ll give you the whole truth and what you’ve just described is just factually wrong. This, what Kevin Rudd is

saying, is that there has been a sudden upsurge in refugee claims and refugee numbers around the world and

this is the push factor, and therefore everything he’s done domestically is irrelevant.

Let me tell you that is completely and utterly wrong. I’ll explain. The push factor - that is to say the number of

refugees around the world, all of whom would love to come to Australia if they could, is enormous, has always

been enormous, in fact if you look at the UN High Commission on Refugees’ own report from June this year -

and it’s on their website, the UN High Commission on Refugees, look at their report, June 2009 - you will see the

number of refugees over the last year has actually declined somewhat. In fact…

JON FAINE:

Minimally, but there is a push into Europe, there’s Africans coming across to Italy, to Spain. The world’s awash

with refugees.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I totally agree with you but the question is not whether the world has got a lot of refugees, there’s about 11 million

according to the UNHCR, the question is whether the push factors have increased. For example, the largest

single source of refugees has been Afghanistan. There are currently 2.8 million Afghans living outside of

Afghanistan who are categorised as refugees. At the peak it was about 6.5 million. So 2.8 million is still a

staggering figure but it’s a lot lower than it was.

So the reality is the push factors are enormous, always have been enormous, sadly probably always will be

enormous. What the big change has been - the pull factor - Rudd’s reckless unpicking of a policy that worked

and by doing that he outsourced our immigration policy, our program to the people smugglers.

JON FAINE:

Gino, thank you for your question. Bruce from Ashwood, morning Bruce.

CALLER:

Yes, good morning, Jon. I was just ringing to ask why the republican debate has gone so much off the agenda

and why Mr Turnbull and the Prime Minister are so squeamish about it. I mean, after all Mr Turnbull’s hard work I

just don’t want to see him become the forgotten man of the Australian Republican Movement.

JON FAINE:

Alright, thanks Bruce. Just a reminder, this is what Kevin Rudd said in answer to a similar question from me on

just yesterday’s program.

Kevin Rudd: I said prior to the last election that on the question of the republic it would not be a priority for any

first term that we occupied in office. It would be something which we attended to later if the Government is re-elected. And that’s very much the position I still have.

JON FAINE:

That was Kevin Rudd yesterday. Malcolm Turnbull, are you in agreement on one thing?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Spoken with characteristic passion by the Prime Minister!

Look, I am a very committed republican. I would dearly love to see an Australian citizen as our head of state and

I’m no less committed to it now than I was in 1999 when the referendum was held. The question is when can we

win a referendum? I want to win a referendum. I want Australia to be a republic. I want us to have an Australian

citizen as head of state.

I do not believe, and this is a political judgement, I might be wrong, I do not believe a referendum can be won,

successfully put - and they’re very hard to win at any time - I do not believe one can successfully be put prior to

the end of the Queen’s reign. I said that back in ’99 Jon, and many of your listeners would remember. I said to

those people who were saying I’ll vote not on this model and we’ll get another crack in a year’s time. I said if you

vote no it means no for a long time. Now sadly that…

JON FAINE:

Will you go to the next election undertaking that under a Malcolm Turnbull government you would implement a

process for a republic upon the passing of the current Queen?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I think that is… I don’t know whether we would have that as a formal policy because…

JON FAINE:

Well why not? That’s what you just said.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No, just let me come to it Jon, but I can say to you that speaking as the Leader of the Opposition and I mean

John Howard, who was my opponent in ’99 said much the same thing yesterday - I think John and I would both

agree on this - that it would be virtually impossible to get the republic issue on the front burner before the end of

the Queen’s reign and virtually impossible to keep it off the front burner after the end of her reign. So at the end

of the Queen’s reign - and republicans and monarchists, we all wish the Queen a long life and long may she

reign. At some point her reign will come to an end and whether that is when I’m prime minister or somebody else

- presumably someone would be prime minister - at that point the issue will come back to the forefront and that’s

when I think you will see in all probability another referendum question.

JON FAINE:

You could build that into the referendum. You could ask the people of Australia upon the passing of the current

Queen, do you want to now commence a process that is triggered to create a republic upon the end of her reign.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

That’s been suggested, Jon, by a few people. I don’t think that would be successful.

JON FAINE:

Why not?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well look…

JON FAINE:

Just a gut feeling?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Look I have a very high degree, I have a post doctoral qualification in not winning referendums so there are very

few people who can speak with more authority than me on the difficulties of winning referendums. And I just have

to say to you, to win a referendum you need to have all the planets aligned, you need to have the wind in your

sails, you need to have everything going for you.

And I think if you put up a referendum on the republic issue prior to the end of the Queen’s reign your chances of

winning it are very, very low compared to what it may be after the end of her reign.

JON FAINE:

Seven minutes to nine. Andrew in Ashburton. Good morning, Andrew.

CALLER:

Hello Jon and hello Malcolm.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Hi.

CALLER:

I just want to ask a question in regards to gay marriage. Australians as a whole are quite a tolerant nation and,

again, both the Liberal and Labor governments don’t support any recognition of the love between a man and a

man, a woman or a woman; the same recognition that is given to a man and a woman. I just don’t understand

why in today’s age, when the majority of Australians are for or supportive of homosexuality or queerness, why the

Government can’t recognise that love doesn’t discriminate and neither should the law.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I am pleased that we have now legislated to eliminate really every form of, certainly under federal law,

discrimination as between married couples, men and women, and same-sex couples…

JON FAINE:

That’s answering a question that Andrew didn’t ask about this.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I know Jon, I’m just coming to the point, just answering the accusation. So I’m certainly opposed to any form of

discrimination based on people’s sexual orientation. However, I believe that marriage is a permanent union

between a man and a woman. And so I do not disrespect unions between or relationships, partnerships -

whatever you want to call it - between people of the same sex but it is not a marriage. A marriage in my view and

I think the view of most Australians is a permanent union between a man and a woman.

JON FAINE:

So no change from your party whilst you’re leader on gay marriage?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No. There will be no change and I don’t believe there will be any change on the part of the Labor Party either. I

think there is a broad commitment that marriage, as I said, is a permanent union between a man and a woman.

That does not disrespect other relationships at all but marriage is between men and women.

JON FAINE:

Andrew, thank you for your question. Layne in Mitcham. Good morning, Layne.

CALLER:

Good morning, how are you?

JON FAINE:

Good.

CALLER:

I would like to say to Malcolm that he is criticising - and this is with regard to the asylum seekers situation and

many other situations for that matter - constant criticism that’s hiding behind not having enough knowledge to

make any suggestions as constructive improvement. It’s very easy and the world’s full of people who can sit and

criticise every single thing that somebody else does but offer no constructive improvement, continue waffling on

about the past about how good they were. It doesn’t help the future. We’re looking at a situation now, we’re

looking at a solution to be made about now. We don’t want to hear about what was before over and over and

over again. It’s like a worn out record.

JON FAINE:

Layne, have you got a question?

CALLER:

Malcolm you should stop hiding behind the fact that you don’t know much and either shut up because you don’t

know much or find out a little bit more and offer something constructive...

JON FAINE:

Layne, have you got a question for the Leader of the Opposition or not?

CALLER:

Yes, Malcolm when are you going to provide us with some solutions rather than just criticisms?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well we’ve certainly pointed to the policies that worked under the previous government and with great respect,

saying that you should have no regard to the past or to history, that’s a pretty rash statement. If you had policies

that as at 2007 worked, and they were changed in 2008 and now you’ve got a catastrophic policy failure, it’s not

unreasonable to point back to those policies.

As to the question about how the situation, managing those 78 people on the Oceanic Viking can be managed, I

do not believe, with great respect to you, my personal opinion without any of the information as to what’s actually

happening on the boat is going to be of much assistance to Kevin Rudd.

JON FAINE:

Good on you Layne. Thank you for your question. I have the unusual situation of the Opposition Leader being

joined by the Opposition Leader. Ted Baillieu is the State Opposition Leader who also joins us in the studio this

morning. Ted Baillieu good morning.

TED BAILLIEU:

Good morning, Jon.

JON FAINE:

You’ve just announced a reshuffle yesterday which I shall ask you about in a moment. Malcolm Turnbull, tempted

to also introduce a reshuffle before we got to the polls for the federal Opposition?

TED BAILLIEU:

Nice try Jon.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Very good, well, as Ted will agree, leaders of political parties decide on the timing of their reshuffles and who

gets reshuffled, who the reshufflees are.

JON FAINE:

Do you rule out a reshuffle?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Of course I don’t rule it out.

JON FAINE:

So when’s it coming?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

You’ll know. I will let you know. I’ll send you a tweet.

JON FAINE:

It’s exactly a year until the next State election, Ted Baillieu, so I’ll go through after the news with you the details of

the reshuffle.

TED BAILLIEU:

A year and two or three weeks.

JON FAINE:

You can compare notes on the perils of being in Opposition and how to cope with bad newspolls, in fact, while I

have you both in the studio together.

TED BAILLIEU:

And what would you like us to address, Jon?

JON FAINE:

That went down like a lead balloon, didn’t it?

TED BAILLIEU:

I don’t think Malcolm or I are about to start playing the commentary on polls.

JON FAINE:

No, no, well it was worth a try.

Just finally, Malcolm Turnbull, Barnaby Joyce goading you into almost kicking him out or making him walk away

from the Coalition. Are you tempted?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No. I make a practise of letting everybody else run a commentary on the Coalition. And I see Barnaby a lot, meet

with him a lot…

JON FAINE:

Do you value his contribution?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Look, I do value Barnaby’s contribution and any discussions we have about managing the relationship between

the Nationals and the Liberals, which is obviously an important part of a coalition everywhere, those discussions

are ones we have privately. So I don’t propose to have discussions with Barnaby through a megaphone.

JON FAINE:

You can tweet to him as well. Thank you for your time this morning. Malcolm Turnbull, Leader of the Federal

Opposition.
