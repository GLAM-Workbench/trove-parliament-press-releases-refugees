PORTUGUESE TIMOR

The United Nations Security Council should seize the   opportunity now offered to it to chart an agreed path towards the   peaceful exercise of the right to self-determination by the people   of Portuguese Timor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon.   Andrew Peacock, said today.

Mr Peacock was commenting on the opening of debate in   the Council on the question of Timor, at the request of the   Portuguese Government,  '

He.urged that, in their approach to the debate, members   should have primary regard to the future of the territory and its   people.

The Minister Ã¢ÂÂ   recalled that last week the General Assembly   had approved a resolution which had as its objective a resumption   of the process of peaceful decolonisation in Timor, leading to the   exercise by the people of the territory of the right to selfÂ­ determination.

Australia had voted for that resolution, but with misÂ­ givings because of some of its provisions. The resolution, of   course, was not binding upon the Security Council, but the debate   in the Assembly could give the members of the Council some guidance   in carrying out their responsibilities.

The Australian delegation, which had played an active   part in the Assembly's discussions, was also participating in the   work of the Council - although as a non-member of the Council it   would not have the right to vote.’

Recalling the words of the Australian Permanent   Representative to the UN, Mr Ralph Harry, in his statement to the   Council yesterday, Mr Peacock said that the best first step forward   might be for the Secretary^General of the UN to appoint a special

representative to conduct consultations on the Timor problem and

to report back with recommendations as to further action.

The objective should be to establish conditions in which  the Timorese people could make their own free choice as to their  future. !

"For this to happen, however,  it is more than ever  necessary to bring about - and to maintain - conditions of peace  and order in Timor," he said. "Any reversion to chaos, for  example through the absence of civil authority, could set this  whole process at risk and would do a disservice to the Timorese

people."

An essential step, therefore, would be to stop the  fighting as quickly as possible and to institute a process of  peaceful self-determination, with appropriate United Nations  involvement, that would facilitate the withdrawal from Portuguese  Timor of forces from Indonesia.

Mr Peacock also reaffirmed the Australian Government's  hope that humanitarian aid would be resumed to Portuguese Timor  in the near future.  He said that official aid would be made  available as soon as assurances were received through the

Indonesian Government that the authorities in Dili were prepared  to accept such aid. He had...raised the matter again directly with  the Indonesian Ambassador on 16 December.

Mr Peacock told the Ambassador that the Australian  Government hoped that ICRC operations would soon resume and that  Australian aid could again be channelled through the ICRC. He  urged that this view be communicated to the Indonesian Government.

Mr Peacock said that the resources of Portuguese Timor  were meagre and that humanitarian aid, and in all likelihood food  aid, were needed. The Government had been advised that the  Indonesian Government had already made available large stocks of

supplies, a number of ships having berthed at Dili and Baucau over  the past few days with stores to meet emergency needs of the  Timorese community.

"Nevertheless it will clearly be necessary for Australian  aid to supplement what the Indonesian Government has already  provided," he said.

Mr Peacock said the Government was actively pursuing  inquiries into whether there was likely to be a refugee problem  because of events in~ Portuguese Timor. If a refugee problem did  arise, the Government would take a sympathetic and positive position

in line with the attitude traditionally adopted by Liberal-National  Country Party governments. Â· * Ã¢ÂÂ
