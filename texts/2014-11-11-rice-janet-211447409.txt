Australia must speak up on illegal logging of PNG rainforests

The Greens have called on the Abbott government to acknowledge the destruction of  rainforests in Papua New Guinea ahead of tomorrow's Asia Pacific Rainforest  Conference in Sydney.

"As a major beneficiary of the proceeds of illegal logging in Papua New Guinea,  Australia has a responsibility to assist the PNG government to clean up this trade," said  the Greens spokesperson for Forests Senator Janet Rice.

The summit, which is being hosted by Environment Minister Greg Hunt, will consider key  areas including 'combatting illegal logging', 'protecting biodiversity' and 'eliminating  deforestation from the supply chain'.

"The situation is dire," said Senator Rice.

"There are serious allegations of corrupt officials, land is being stolen from PNG  communities, and forests and wildlife are being destroyed. Locals are being forced to  flee as refugees.

"Yet Greg Hunt has remained silent on this destruction.

"The Abbott government must acknowledge these injustices, assist the PNG government  in tackling the illegal logging and take measures to prevent any proceeds of this logging  flowing to Australia."
