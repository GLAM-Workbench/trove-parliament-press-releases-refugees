Customs vessels intercept boat people

Two Customs vessels have intercepted a boat with suspected illegal   entrants at Ashmore islands, the Minister for Justice and Customs,   Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

Both the ACV Botany Bay and ACV Wauri were patrolling yesterday in   the area at the request of Customs Coastwatch. They sighted the   motorised Indonesian fishing vessel as it was approaching the Ashmore   group of islands off Western Australia yesterday.

The vessel was carrying 17 passengers of middle-eastern origin and   four Indonesian crew members. All were in good health. The vessel was   assessed as unseaworthy and is to be destroyed.

“Customs Coastwatch remains alert to the possibilities of further vessels   attempting illegal entry to Australia. This is another example of our   successful surveillance system to protect Australia’s borders,” Senator   Vanstone said.

Arrangements are being made for ACV Botany Bay to transfer the   people to the mainland where they will be handed over to Department of   Immigration and Multicultural Affairs officials.
