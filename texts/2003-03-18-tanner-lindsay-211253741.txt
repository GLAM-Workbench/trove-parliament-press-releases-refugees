LINDSAY TANNER MP  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR MELBOURNE  JULIA GILLARD MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR POPULATION AND IMMIGRATION



LET THEM STAY CRICKET TOUR



Federal  politicians  today  took  on  the  ‘Yarra  Croca-Roos’,  an  East   Timorese Australian cricket team of school children, to raise awareness  of the plight of East Timorese Australians facing deportation. The match  was held at the Senate Oval at Parliament House.

These  children  have  travelled  by  bus  from  Melbourne  to  Canberra  to   let our cricket loving Prime Minister know that any moves to deport East  Timorese  Australians  is  just  not  cricket.  Most  of  these  asylum  seekers   have lived in Australia for over a decade.

As  Yarra  Mayor,  Cr  Sue  Corby,  has  said,  “the  general  community   regards East Timorese Australians as citizens with strong connections to  our schools and sporting clubs”.

Labor MPs Julia Gillard, Lindsay Tanner, Kate Lundy, Alan Griffin, Gavan  O’Connor,  Warren  Snowdon  and  Anthony  Byrne  have  all  put  on  their   whites in support of our East Timorese Community. Kerry Nettle from the  Greens and Liberal MP, Peter King, also played for the politicians side.

The  Government  must  support  Labor’s  moves  to  grant  permanent   residency  to  the  around  1,600  East  Timorese  asylum-seekers  who  are   currently being threatened with deportation.
