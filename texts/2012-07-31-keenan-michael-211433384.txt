Topic/s: Labor’s border protection crisis

Graham Mabury

The record for the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat, irregular entries if you want to call them that, the record number  arriving  in  any  one  year  has  been  broken,  Department  of  Immigration  figures  show.  In  fact  6,765  people  have arrived  this  year  topping  the  2010  record  of  6,555.  We  are  going  to  seek  a  reaction  to  this  from  our  next  guest,  the Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan. Thank you for joining us Michael, welcome to Nightline.

Michael Keenan

It’s a pleasure to be with you Graham.

Graham Mabury

Now you are reported as saying that this is simply proof that the current policies are not deterring asylum seekers.

Michael Keenan

I think that’s pretty clear when you’ve reached a record year and it’s only July. So in seven months this year it’s already  been  worse  than  the  entire  previous  recorded  year  which  was  under  Kevin  Rudd  and  Julia  Gillard  in  2010.  So  clearly something  is  not  working  and  the  people  smugglers  know  that  at  the  moment  they  have  a  whip  hand  and  that’s  why   they’ve been bringing people down to Australia illegally in such record numbers.

Graham Mabury

It seems as though that the Australian people are saying a pox on all the politician’s houses. The Opposition won’t move,  the Government won’t move; there’s a committee looking into it and yet the boats keep coming.

Michael Keenan

Well we don’t need a committee; we just need a return to the policies that have actually worked. I’m not sure that people  are clamouring for a compromise, they’re clamouring for a solution and if you are going to have a solution then you need to go back to the point where the system was broken and the system was broken by the Labor Party in 2008 when they changed the robust system of border protection that they inherited from the Howard Government. When that happened, that  happened  in  August  of  2008,  they  changed  policies,  and  they  abolished  the  Pacific  Solution,  they  abolished   temporary protection visas, and what happened was literally from the next month, September 2008, the people smugglers went back into business and we started having people arrive here illegally, first as a trickle and of course that trickle has subsequently become a flood because the more successful the people smugglers are, the easier it is for them to sell their product.

So in effect, you think that the whole situation just plays into their hands?

Michael Keenan

No question, the more successful they are about getting people down to Australia then the more successful  they can be at selling their product which they can sell for US$10-15,000 a head. Clearly if they are getting people to Australia in such record numbers within a very short space of time - you could be smuggled into Australia, the Australian Government will intercept you, bring you to Christmas Island, then you’ll be released into the community, you’ll be able to work. You’ll be  able  to  be  on  welfare,  they’ll  give  you  community  housing  and  that  will  come  with  a  community  housing  package.  So clearly  what  is  being  sold  by  the  people  smugglers  is  an  incredibly good product and that is why they are  having  such great success in selling it.

Graham Mabury

Is it Opposition policy to turn the boats back?

Michael Keenan

Yes it is and it has been for over a decade, we actually implemented it when we were in Government. We did turn boats back, other Navy’s around the world turn boats back. The Labor Party’s stated policy prior to being elected was that they  were going to turn the boats back but they just haven’t had the courage to implement it while they’ve been in government.

Graham Mabury

We’ve had  your opposite  number Senator Bob  Carr saying that this would  be illegal under Australian law  and create a crisis between the relationship with us and Indonesia.

Michael Keenan

They’ve  created  a  crisis  with  Indonesia  because  they’ve  bungled  that  relationship  by  mismanaging  the  Oceanic  Viking incident  and  completely  bungling  the  live  cattle  export  business  and  the  Indonesians  are  pretty  upset  with  the  current Australian Government. To say that it is illegal and can’t happen - it has happened, the proof is in the pudding, we have  done it before and Indonesia accepted it then. I believe that we can successfully implement that policy just as we have in the past and all of the evidence suggests that we can because as I said we have actually done it.

Graham Mabury

The fact that we now have 6,765 people who have arrived here by boat but there have also been figures released that say we have 70 new illegal over-stayers every week and that Australian immigration authorities can’t find just under 60,000 of  them, 55,900 plus, so have we lost a bit of perspective here?

Michael Keenan

This is a serious issue but it is a different issue and people over-staying their visa is a very different thing because if you  are over-staying your visa then what you have done is that you have legally come to Australia with your travel documents and we have looked at who you are and we have granted you a visa, now that is very different to someone who arrives here  courtesy of  a criminal  gang. The two  things are  totally different problems even though  I appreciate  that visa over-staying  is  relatively  serious,  it’s  not  as  serious  as  people  arriving  here  illegally  and  the  two  problems,  I  don’t  think,  are   directly comparable in that way.

In your view are these people who are coming here by boat, and by doing so putting their lives at risk, are they queue-jumpers?

Michael Keenan

I understand why people would want to come to Australia, we are a very lucky country and I understand that there are people around the world who would like to enjoy the lifestyle that we have here. I think that’s a perfectly understandable  thing  but  what  we  cannot  accept  as  a  country  is  that  we  are  not  in  charge  of  our  own  immigration  system  and  what’s   happening at the moment is that we have ceded that to criminal gangs - so we are not in charge of it, you pay a criminal a  very significant sum of money and they can get you here illegally and that’s what no self respecting nation can accept. If  we were to accept that then the numbers would just keep rising, we’ve had almost 7,000 already this year alone and you  can imagine what it would be like if we were to just accept that you can pay people smugglers to get here and as a nation we just can’t possibly absorb that.

Graham Mabury

So under an Abbott Government, what would be the policy with regard to arrival by boat, what would happen?

Michael Keenan

We  would  go  back  to  the  point  where  I  said  the  policy  was  broken,  and  that  was  August  2008.  We  would  return  to temporary protection visas, we would reinstate offshore processing on the island nation of Nauru and we would turn the boats back around when it was safe to do so and that suite of policies was exactly the suite of policies that stopped people smuggling before and we believe that it will stop it again.

Graham Mabury

Great to talk to you, we really appreciate your time, Michael Keenan thanks for joining us

Michael Keenan

Always a pleasure Graham.
