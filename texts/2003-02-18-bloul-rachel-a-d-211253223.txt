Abstract: Can  a  Muslim  victim  of  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  religion  obtain

reparation?  Though  Islamophobia  has  been  recognized  as  a  specific  discriminatory

practice  in  the  European  Union  and  Australia,  present  legislations  often  do  not

recognize  or  recognize  very  restrictively,  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  religion.

And Muslim victims often cannot use anti-discrimination laws on the grounds of race

and  ethnicity as  Islam  is  not  recognized  as  an  ‘ethno-religion’.  The  paper  examines

issues  related  to  anti-Muslim  discrimination  in  the  European  Union  and  Australia,

including present efforts to enlarge anti-discrimination legal provisions.











3   BLOUL,  Rachel

The  emergence  of  Islamophobia  as  a  specific  form  of  racism  against  recently  established  Muslim

minorities  in  Australia  and  the  European  Union  has  exposed  the  inadequacies  of  anti-discrimination

legislation in many of the countries in question. Many of these inadequacies are rooted in the Western

history, and evolving understandings, of racism which the law mirrors, albeit at its usual stately pace.

Thus, legal understandings of racism, derived from different moments in Western evolving conception

of  ‘race’,  might  or  might  not  include  discrimination  and  harassment  on  the  grounds  of  religion.  To

complicate things even further, some states legislations sought to strike a compromise whereby race is

defined  to  include  ‘ethno-religious  origin’.  This  latter  category evolved  to  take  into  account  the  long

and unglorious Western history of antisemitism, and is accordingly, strictly understood to refer to cases

where  the  boundaries  of  ethnicity  coincide  with  religious  boundaries.  As  a  result,  anomalies  and

contradictions  abound  in  anti-discrimination  laws,  leading  to  ridiculously  unjust  but  perfectly  legal

decisions  whereby,  for  a  complaint  against  similar  offences  when  there  is  not  specific  legislation

against  religious  discrimination  per  se,  a  Jew  can  obtain  reparation  while  a  Muslim  cannot.  Such

disparities have created protests which have been variously received. The European Union for example

is on its way to redress the situation with new anti-discrimination provisions on the grounds of religion

in regard of employment and equal opportunity, superseding national legislations, to  come into  effect

this year1. In Australia however, the situation can be confusing. Australia recognises religious freedom

and  even  the  nature  of  Islamophobia  as  a  racist  phenomenon.  However,  there  is  no  federal  Religious

Freedom Act and discrimination and vilification on the ground of religion and belief is a state matter.

Thus, South Australia has no anti-discrimination provisions on the grounds of religion and New South

Wales’  anti-discrimination  laws  exclusively  concern  ethno-religious  groups,  narrowly  defined.  Only

Queensland  and  Victoria  have  recently  (2001)  extended  anti-discrimination  laws  to  cover  religious

vilification, and this gave rise to rather heated debates and opposition (see below).



Nowhere  else  is  there  a  comprehensive  religious  discrimination  law  similar  to  that  existing  for

racial/ethnic  discrimination.  This  is  not  surprising  as  there  are  a  number  of  difficulties  inherent  to

legislating  on  religious  discrimination,  and  especially  religious  vilification2,  difficulties  that  are  dealt

with,  occasionally  with  a  system  of  ad  hoc  exemptions.  Nonetheless,  religious  differences  often  give

rise  to  racist  discrimination,  especially  in  the  contemporary  context  of  international  migration  when

certain  religious  differences  acquire  visibility.  As  the  experiences  of  Muslims  in  the  West  show,  this

leads to specific forms of racism such as Islamophobia.



In this paper I want to discuss the intertwining of racist and religious discrimination in reference to the

current  phenomenon  of  Islamophobia  and  reflect  on  existing  anti-discrimination  legislations  on  the

grounds of religion.



1  This new legislation is not however a comprehensive religious discrimination law similar to that  existing for racial/ethnic discrimination. For example it does not include provisions regarding  incitement to religious hatred.  2

For example, religious schools have a legitimate right to give preferment to teachers belonging to  their own denomination, free speech and tolerance must be enforced while respecting religious  sensitivities.

Reflecting a Western history of racism:

In  this  section,  I  show how definitions  of  racism,  as  evidenced  by  international  legal  and  quasi-legal

documents  reflect  a  history  and  understandings  of  racial  prejudices,  rooted  in  the  history  of  Western

colonialism and Western antisemitism3.



Recognising evolving definitions



The United Nations have evolved a number of instruments (Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and so on)

pertaining to human rights and aimed at preventing discrimination against person or persons since the

first Declaration  of  Human  Rights  in  1948.  Definitions  of  human  rights  have  evolved  and  a  global

human  rights  movement  linking  activists,  scholars,  NGOs  have  actively  been  involved  in  the

elaboration  of  ever  more  specific  human  rights  and  ever  more  accurate  definitions  of  discrimination.

With  regard  of  religious  discrimination,  the International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights

(1966), prohibits more specifically religious discrimination while the Declaration on the Elimination of

All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, adopted in 1981, provides

a comprehensive list of rights regarding freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Finally, the 1989

Vienna  Concluding  Document contains  provisions  similar  to  the  1948,  1966  and  1981  documents,

urging respect for religious differences, especially among various faith communities.

Similarly, the definition of what constitutes racism and discrimination has evolved. The understanding

of racism has moved from a definition of ‘prejudice based on (now disqualified biological notions of)

race’  to  a  recognition  of  various  forms  of  racism  as  1)  an  individual's  discriminatory  attitudes  and

behaviours  (individual  racism),  2)  as  policies  and  practices  of  organizations,  which  directly  or

indirectly  operate  to  sustain  the  advantages  of  peoples  of  certain  "social  races"  (institutional  racism)

and 3) as a value system which is embedded in society and supports and allows discriminatory actions

based  on  perceptions  of  racial  difference,  cultural  superiority  and  inferiority  (cultural  racism).  Such

evolving  definitions  are  legitimated  by,  and  in  turn  legitimate,  the  progressive  refinement  of  UN

documents  and  recommendations  on  racial  discrimination.  These  refinements  in  turn  are  reflected  in

evolving anti-discrimination legislations.



The phenomena of related intolerance(s)



Thus,  racism  has  become  generally  recognised  as  a  cluster  of  related  phenomena  including  “racial

discrimination, xenophobia, antisemitism and related intolerance”. The recognition of antisemitism as a

specific form of racism is rooted  in a long European history of antisemitism which culminated  in the

Holocaust  events  though  it  is  only  at  the  World  Human  Rights  Conference  in  Vienna  in  1993  that



3  Please note: I am not saying that racism is a purely Western phenomenon. On the contrary I would  argue, had I the space, that racism against ‘Others’ is one of the most widely shared characteristic of  human cultures. What I am saying is that the forms that racism took in the West have conditioned, and  still condition present international legal understandings of (racial) discrimination which are at the root  of the legal incongruities which this paper explores.

5   BLOUL,  Rachel

antisemitism  has  been  included  as  a  form  of  racial  discrimination  together  with  any  form  of

discrimination  against  Muslims4.  Generally  speaking,  it  is  because  of  this  long  Western  history  that

antisemitism  is  included  in  various  racial  discrimination  laws  under  the  category  of  ethno-religious

prejudice.  This  is  the  case  for  the  Australian  Racial  Discrimination  Act  of  1975,  the  NSW  Anti

Discrimination  Act  19775,  the  United  Kingdom’s  1976  Race  Relations  Act  and  1998  Human  Rights

Act.



Antisemitism and the case of ethno-religion:



There are two general points to be made about these special provisions against antisemitism based on

an  understanding  of  Judaism  as  an  ethno-religion.  The  first  concerns  the  status  of  antisemitism  as  “a

unique  and  separate  form  of  racism”  (Dr  G.  Weisskirchen,  Co-Chairman  of  the  Inter  Parliamentary

Forum on Confronting and Combating Anti Semitism in the OSCE Region, 10/12/02). And the second

concerns ethno-religion as a legal category.



On antisemitism as a unique and separate case of racism:

Antisemitism  is  a  term  coined  in  the  1870s  by  Wilhelm  Marr  to  distinguish  between  old-time  Jews

hatred  and  modern,  political,  ethnic  or  racial  opposition  to  the  Jews.  It  soon  became  extended  to  all

types  of  Jew-hatred  in  a  distinctly  anachronistic  way  which,  moreover,  seems  to  forget  that  Jews

cannot,  by  any  stretch  of  the  term,  be  called  a  race  at  all  and  not  even  an  ethnic  group6.  However,

during even this shortened history, antisemitism has been defined in a variety of ways. The endurance

of  Jew-hatred  and  antisemitism  beyond  the  various  causes  and  theories  proposed  by  scholars  has

become for some a major justification for viewing antisemitism as an exceptional phenomenon which

cannot  be  explained  by  theories  of  racism  alone7.  For  many  contemporary  Jewish  militants  against

antisemitism,

“modern antisemitism is not religious discrimination and to define

it as such misses the central point that for the modern anti-Semite the issue

was  not  one  of  belief  but  of  blood...  In  other  words,  Jewishness  was  a

matter of ancestry”



4  As a result of the Vienna Conference, in 1993, the Human Rights Commission in Geneva added anti-semitism to the forms of discrimination to be reported in its annual report on racism:    “The Commission requests the special rapporteur to examine according to his mandate  incidents of contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, any form of discrimination against  Blacks, Arabs and Muslims, xenophobia, anti-semitism, and related intolerance as well as  governmental measures to overcome them…” (http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0azn0)   5

Interestingly, the Sydney Anglican synod opposed a proposal to include religion as a ground of  prohibited discrimination during the 1993 review of the Anti Discrimination Act 1977 on the grounds  that (1) the concept of ‘ethno-religion’ was not defined and (2) “the protections to enable the quotations  of biblical principles particularly in relation to the practice of homosexuality were not sufficiently  entrenched” (http://www.sydney.anglican.asn.au/synod/synod93/stancom.htm)     6

This is why purists insist that it should written ‘antisemite’, as the hyphen would indicate an hatred  directed toward ‘Semites’ a group that necessarily included Arabs as well (see Shmuel Almog, “What’s  in a Hyphen?”  http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/hyphen.htm).  7

See Manuel Prutschi, “Antisemitism, Islamophobia and Anti-Arabism: The False Link”  http://www.cjc.ca/ptemplate.php?action=issues&item=10&Type=1.

6   BLOUL,  Rachel

(Manuel Prutschi 2001)

On the other hand nor is it a matter of ordinary racism because (1) as mentioned earlier, Jews cannot be

called a race or even an ethnic group and (2) yet Jew-hatred as “systematic, systemic bigotry or hatred

against  a  collectivity…is  the  oldest  and  most  enduring  form  of  hatred…  over  2  millennia”  (ibid);  in

other words a form of hatred much beyond other, historical forms of racism.



It  is  this  exceptionalism  that  I  presume  the  law  hoped  to  capture  in  its  reference  to  ‘ethno-religion’8

which is used  but rarely defined  in the legislations mentioned  above in NSW,  Australia and  the U.K.

However,  this  merely  replaces  the  question  of  the  links  between  racism  and  antisemitism,  by  the

problem of what can qualify as an ‘ethno-religion’ in law.



Ethno-religion as a legal category:

This  is  the  problem  I  encountered  recently  when,  as  a  specialist  in  both  ethnic  relations  and  Muslim

migrations in the West, I was commissioned to provide expert advice on the question whether Muslims

can be covered by NSW anti-discrimination laws. Perusing UK case-studies, I quickly discovered that,

though  one  can  often  use  the  existing  anti-discrimination  ‘ethno-religion’  provision  to  argue  that  in

Western countries, discrimination against Muslims often amounts to ‘indirect racial discrimination’, the

outcome  for  such  argumentation  is  by  no  means  guaranteed.  A  lot  therefore  seems  to  ride  on  the

interpretation of ethno-religion as a legal category9 and this particular conundrum is a direct heritage of

the specific history of Western racism and anti-Semitism.

However, the term ‘ethno-religion’ is a recognised category in the social sciences, and its usage in this

field, I thought, could provide some useful ways to deal with the legal problem.



What is an ‘ethno-religion’?



The links between ethnicity, culture and religion:



The term ‘ethnicity’ is of relatively recent usage and appeared in the 1950s in the English language. It

is first recorded in a dictionary in the Oxford English Dictionary of 1953 as a derivative of the older

and  more  commonly  used  adjective  ‘ethnic’.  ‘Ethnic’  had  consistently  been  used  to  refer  to  other

groups  of  people  who  share  common  cultural  or  biological  characteristics,  and  who  live  and  act  in

concert. It implies a dichotomy between non-ethnic ‘us’ and ethnic ‘others’.





8  I have been unable to ascertain the first use of the term ‘ethno-religion’, though I can assert that this  term is not listed in the usual dictionaries (I have consulted the extended Oxford, the Webster and the  Cambridge Dictionaries in addition to various specialised dictionaries.  9

It is not defined in law except “ethno-religious groups such as Jews’.

7   BLOUL,  Rachel

Though the key term in the field is that of ‘ethnic group’ or ‘ethnic community’, there is considerable

debate  on  its  stipulative  definition  -  i.e.  the  necessary  traits  that  all  ethnic  groups  must  share  to  be

defined as such- (Hutchinson & Smith, 1996:5-610).



Initially,  scholars  insisted  on  the  importance  of  ‘primordial  ties’  stressing  an  understanding  of  ethnic

communities as immemorial, persisting units linked  by descent. This view, however, has been largely

abandoned  as  unable  to  deal  with  contemporary  social  changes,  in  particular  the  formation  of  new

identities following the increase of global migration flows. The establishment of de facto multicultural

societies in Western countries promoted debate in the new field of ‘ethnic studies’. Since 1981, such

debates  have  increasingly  focused  on  ‘new racism’  and  ‘new ethnicities’  (Hall  199211).  In  particular,

contemporary  analyses  have  come  to  stress  the  socio-political  and  cultural  aspects  of  ‘ethnic

consciousnesses’,  whereby  a  group  of  people  draw  on  a  common  ‘ethnic  identity’  to  distinguish

themselves from other minority groups and from a majority (usually left undefined in ethnic terms).



Ethnic  identity  has  a  number  of  dimensions:  social,  cultural,  symbolic,  political  and  emotional

(collective  memory  &  allegiance  to  community).  Religion  is  one  aspect  of  ethnic  identity  which

influences  most,  if  not  all,  of  these  dimensions.  But  the  relationship  between  ethnicity  and  religion

have been conceptualised in a variety of ways. Religion can be an element of ethnicity (Smith 199212),

or  in  a  context  where  religious  differences  constitute  the  distinctive  difference  between  majority  and

minority,  then  religious  difference  becomes  the constitutive  element  of  the  ethnicity  of  the  minority.

Goldman (200013) describes the contextual nature of ethnic definitions:



“Ethnic  groups  may  be  identified  by  language  (Brass  1991,  Fishman

1980…) by kinship and ancestry (Grossby 1994, Herberg 1989...), by place

of  birth  of  the  individuals  or  the  ancestors  of  individuals  (Goldscheider

1995),  by  religious  affiliation  (Goldscheiber  1995…)  and  by  other

appropriate  ethno-cultural  characteristics  that  may  be  unique  to  the

context in which the ethnic group exists… The characteristics that define

ethnic  minorities  may  vary  from  one  group  to  the  next  and  from  one

context to the next.” (Goldman 2000)



Definitions and the importance of context:

8   BLOUL,  Rachel

This  contextual  dimension  plays  an  even  greater  role  in  the  concept  of  ethno-religion  which  occurs

regularly in the  literature.  Though it may seem a  priori  more  specific,  this concept is nonetheless not

used in a consistent way in the literature. It can refer to:



1. a specific ethnic group with its own unique religion (like the Sikhs or the Ba’hais).

2.  an  ethnic  minority  with  a  religious  specificity  in  a  given  country,  though  this  religion  is  also

adhered  to  by  other  people  elsewhere.  For  example,  Punjani  (200214)  uses  ethno-religious  to

distinguish  Hazara  from  Pashtuns  in  Afghanistan  because  the  former  tend  to  adhere  to  Shi’a

Islam  while  the  latter  are  mostly  Sunni  Muslims.  In  Western  countries,  the  Jews  are  often

recognised  as  the archetypical ethno-religious minority on this basis as is expressed  in the anti

discrimination  legislation  in  NSW,  Australia  and  the  UK).  However,  the  state  of  Israel

recognises ethnic, cultural and racial differences between Jews and even accepts as Jews those

converted by liberal Rabbis (note: many more Orthodox Jews do not accept conversions, more

on the Jews as an ethno-religious group below). In other words, for Israel, Jews are not a racial

or an ethnic group (see below).

3.  an  overall  label  for  a  religious  minority  itself  divided  between  different  ethnic  groups.  For

example,  Ali15  distinguishes  in  a  study of  European  Muslims,  between  the  Muslim community

as  an  ‘ethno-religious  group’  which  exists  as  an  emerging  community  with  its  own  voice  and

identity, and the various Muslim ethnic groups within it.

4.  a  minority religion  with  specific  characteristics.  Champion  (199916)  defines ethno-religion as  a

minority  religion  which  has  a  ‘holistic’  dimension  in  which  community  prevails  over  the

individual (the latter cannot leave his or her community).

5.  a minority religion with encompassing cultural dimensions, contrasting with majority practices.

The  Harvard  Encyclopaedia  of  American  Ethnic  Group  defines  the  Mormons  as  an  ethno-religious  group  because  they  have  (a)  a  distinctive  vocabulary,  (b)  shared  history,  (c)  unique

theological  belief,  (d)  definite  in-group  boundaries  and  (e)  a  strong  sense  of  peoplehood.  Yet,

the Mormons have a proselyting religion which accepts converts from a variety of backgrounds.



This is not an exhaustive list, but what these various definitions of ethno-religious do is to point to the

fluidity  of  the  concept.  Experts  in  the  field  may  accept  or  dispute  the  particular  relevance  of  any  of

these  definitions  for  a  particular  study  because  the  definition  of  ethno-religious  is  understood  to  be

contextual, i.e. dependent on the particular context in which it is employed, as it is understood to refer

to the significant difference between the minority and majority in question.

9   BLOUL,  Rachel

A further argument for the contextual dependence of definitions of ethnic identity, and ethno-religious

identity in particular can be found in the recognition of ethnic differences among Jews by the state of

Israel. As mentioned above, the category of ethno-religious group in law was created to cope with anti-Semitism  as  a  special  form  of  racism.  The  grounds  for  this  are  that  Jews  are  a  distinct  people  who

cultivate a myth of ethnic election (Smith op. cit.) -they think of themselves as a ‘chosen people’- and

police group boundaries (one is born a Jew from a Jewish mother, and consequently marriage within

the group is recommended). It is therefore interesting to note that the right of Aliyah (‘return to Israel’)

is  open  to  converts  to  Judaism.  Section  4B  of  the  Law  of  Return  (Amendment  No  2)  5730-197017

explicitly states:

“For the purposes of this Law, “Jew” means a person who was born of

a Jewish mother or has become converted to Judaism…”

If  anybody  can  become  recognized  as  a  Jew  upon  conversion,  then  the  boundaries  of  the  group  are

purely religious in nature.

Furthermore  the  Israeli  state  recognizes  ethnic  and  cultural  differences  among  its  Jewish  population.

There are state-promoted multicultural festivals including ethnic Israeli Jews of many different cultural

backgrounds,  special  integration  programs  concerning  in  particular  Sephardi  (from  the  Middle-East)

and Falasha (from Ethiopia) Jews. Indeed inter-ethnic tensions between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews

have long been recognised (Swirski 199518). The recent arrival of a sizeable minority of Russian Jews

have further complicated the ethnic situation as has the emergence of political parties organized along

ethnic Jewish lines in the Knesset such as Shas (‘Oriental’ Jews), Yisrael B’Aliyah and Yisrael Beitenu

(Russian Jews), see Peled 200019 and Peters & Kook 199920.

If the Jews, the archetypical ethno-religious group, are not in fact considered so by the state of Israel

(one needs not be born a Jew, ethnic, cultural and racial differences between different groups of Jewish

Israeli  are  recognised),  then  one  can  safely  assert  that  what  counts  as  ‘ethno-religious  difference’  is

dependent  on  context  and  functions  as  a  marker  of  belonging  for  specific  religious  minorities,  when

religion constitutes the difference between those and the majority.



Contemporary politics of identity, and the ‘ethnicisation’’ of differences



In  the  contemporary  world,  a  resurgence  of  ethnic  consciousness  means  that  people,  who,  in  a

particular  socio-political  context,  are  distinguishable  from  all  other  groups  by  varying  common

elements, can forge from those an ethnic identity which serves to represent them in the public sphere.

Like old wine in new bottles, this emerging ‘ethnic identity’ makes use of both old cultural traits and

new  markers  (defined  in  the  new  context  of  ‘us’  versus  ‘them’  situation)  to  engage  emotions  and

command  ethnic  allegiance  over  issues  relevant  to  their  situation.  Such  ethnic  identifications  have

various degrees of depth and do not preclude other identifications in different contexts. For example, a

Turkish migrant in Australia will identify as Turkish first in particular situation (say a football match),

but in others will foreground his Muslim identity (a religious festival). The latter religious identity will

become  more  habitually foregrounded  (1)  the  more  often  Muslims  of  diverse  origins  interact  in  their

new Australian context, (2) if they need to organise nationally to obtain recognition for specific needs

and (3) if they find themselves objects of similar discrimination because of their common faith as this

creates new group boundaries (‘us versus them’) along a religious axis. The progressive emergence of a

new ethnic category ‘Muslim Australians’ would  become  unavoidable if these conditions obtain for a

length of time.

Much  recent  scholarship  in  ethnic  studies  has  focused  on  such  politics  of  ethnic  identity  as

unprecedented  movements  of  population  force  interactions  between  people  of  various  origins.  The

goals have been to ascertain the conditions of emergence for ethnic identities (‘ethnicisation’) and how

those  influence  public  debates  and  other  social  issues.  Moreover  the  rapid  evolution  of  global

communications  has  further  complicated  these  issues  as  global  events  impact  on  local  perceptions.

Thus,  many  scholars  have  documented  the  effects  of  the  Gulf  War  on  local  perceptions  and  self-perceptions  of  Australian  Muslims  (Hage  200221).  Not  surprisingly  they  have  generally  found  that

discrimination against Muslims, in the wake of the Gulf War led to a strengthening of bonds within the

Australian Muslim community and a corresponding predominance of the religious factor in their group

consciousness. In other words, Australian Muslims are pushed to identify more as the ‘Muslim Others’

of  the  Australian  majority.  These  are  precisely  the  kind  of  conditions  leading  to  the  ethnicisation  of

differences.  Such  an  ethnicisation  of  a  ‘Muslim  difference’  can  be  shown  to  occur,  though  not  in  a

uniform way in many Western countries where Muslims account now for a sizable minority.



The rise of Islamophobia



The ethnicisation of Islam in other Western countries



Most  Western  countries  have  recently  acquired  Muslim  minorities.  Some  European  countries  have

been receiving migrants of various Muslim origins since the 1950s: England, France and Germany in

particular. Muslim immigration has been more recent in other countries such as the USA and Canada.

In  all  of  these  countries,  albeit  in  different  ways  and  at  different  speeds,  the  Muslim  population  has

been  undergoing  a  process  of  ethnicisation  insofar  as  it  slowly  evolves  into  a  ‘Muslim  minority’,

sharply distinguished from the rest of the population (the ‘us’ versus ‘them’ phenomenon) with its own

‘voice’. Much of this process of ethnicisation has been attributed by the literature to 2 trends: the desire



21  Hage, Ghassan (ed.) 2002 Arab-Australians Today, Melbourne University Press.

11   BLOUL,  Rachel

of  a  settling  population  for  institutional  accommodation  of  their  needs  (establishment  of  mosques,

schools,  provision  of  halal  meat  and  the  like)  and  the  need  for  a  concerted  response  to  escalating

Islamophobia.



The  first  trend  is  well  documented:  see  for  example  Waugh  &  Dennis’  The  shaping  of  a  Islamic

American discourse (1998)22, and Al Sayyad and Castells’ Muslim Europe or Euro-Islam (2002)23 as

well as numerous countries studies on the elaboration of Western Islam(s) (Al Sayyad and Castells for

example have a section called “How does Islam in France differ from Islam in Europe?”). Studies cite

the creation of national organisations coordinating Muslim practice and representing Muslim interests,

and  analyse  the  emergence  of  a  ‘Muslim  voice’  in  national  affairs  (Noormohamed  200024;  Modood

200025,  Vertovec  200226).  Numerous  organisations,  magazines,  websites,  radio  and  TV  programs

participate in this elaboration of distinct national Muslim ‘voices’.

The  second  trend  (growing  Islamophobia)  is  paradoxically linked  to  the  first  as  Vertovec  recognises.

He shows how Islamophobia rises in Britain “alongside advances in Muslim recognition though a kind

of  linked  or  circular  operation”  (Vertovec,  op.  cit.:32).  Moreover  the  more  Islamophobia  rises,  the

more  Muslim  organise  against  it  and  inevitably,  the  more  prominent  the  emerging  ‘Muslim

community’,  and the more Islamophobic tendencies may amplify.  World events have played a role in

making Muslim minorities in the West appear suspicious to members of the majorities. So entrenched

has  this  phenomenon  become  in  the  last  10  years  or  so,  that  the  European  Monitoring  Centre  on

Racism  and  Xenophobia  (http://eumc.eu.int/  )  has  been  monitoring  racist  incidents  and  public  and

political attitudes in all EU member states. It has produced a number of reports documenting the rise of

Islamophobia27 generally understood to be racism against Muslim populations akin to anti-Semitism:

“Islamophobia has fed racist hostility against people of Middle Eastern,

Arab  and  South  Asian  origin  and  has  in  turn  be  bolstered  by  racial

prejudice and xenophobia” (Rudiger 2001)28.



“The term Islamophobia refers to unfounded hostility towards Islam.  It

refers  also  to  the  practical  consequences  of  such  hostility  in  unfair

discrimination  against  Muslim  individuals  and  communities,  and  to  the

exclusion  of  Muslims  from  mainstream  political  and  social  affairs....  The

word ‘Islamophobia’ has been coined because there is a new reality which

needs naming -  anti-Muslim prejudice…”

(An  extract  from  Islamophobia:  A  Challenge  for  Us  All,  compiled  and

published by the Runnymede Trust in 1997)29



Moreover,  for  many,  Islamophobia  is  a  phenomenon  akin  to  anti-Semitism.  Thus,  the  Runnymede

Trust, in its pioneering work on Islamophobia (1997) writes that:



“The word ‘Islamophobia’ has been coined because there is a new

reality  which  needs  naming  -   anti-Muslim  prejudice  has  grown  so

considerably  and  so  rapidly  in  recent  years  that  a  new  item  in  the

vocabulary  is  needed  so  that  it  can  be  identified  and  acted  against.  In  a

similar way there was a time in European history when a new word, anti-Semitism, was needed and coined to highlight the growing dangers of anti-Jewish hostility.”

(The Nature of Islamophobia,

www.runnymedetrust.org/meb/islamophobia/nature.html )



Indeed,  once  it  became  accepted  (in  the  European  Union)  that  Islamophobia  is  a  phenomena  akin  to

anti-Semitism,  the  definition  of  racial  discrimination  was  enlarged  to  include  discrimination  on

religious  grounds  and  the  changes  were  incorporated  in  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.

There is no doubt that these developments were a result of concern over Islamophobia (see for example

the  work  of  the  Commission  for  Racial  Equality  in  the  United  Kingdom -  http://www.cre.gov.uk  ,  as

well as the work of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia - http://eumc.eu.in/.)

Appropriate legislation was drafted  in the Amsterdam Treaty (1997) due to  come into  effect in 2003.

As  mentioned  above  however,  this  new  legislation  does  not  offer  a  comprehensive  religious

discrimination law similar to that existing for racial/ethnic discrimination even though its purpose is to

outlaw discrimination on religious grounds (Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty):

The ethnicisation of Islam in Australia:



An often similar situation prevails in Australia. The Muslim population of Australia is relatively small

and  of  various  origins.  However  Muslims  in  Australia  “…inevitably  had  to  negotiate  their

‘Muslimness’ within the wider social, legal and political environment” (Humphrey 2001)30. Humphrey

argues  that  the  negotiation  of  Muslimness  in  multicultural  societies  in  general,  and  Australia  in

particular,  simplifies  and  homogenises  Muslim  culture  and  identity,  producing  ‘Muslim  others’.

Multicultural politics produce an ethnicised Muslim identity “as a shared immigrant experience and as

a  representational  identity’  (p.35).  This  process  has  led  to  the  establishment  of  national  Muslim

institutions and organisations aiming to promote “the unity of an Australian Muslim identity” Nehaban

1999)31. Such institutions comprise, among others, the Australian Federation of Islamic Communities,

the  Muslim  Women’s  National  Network  of  Australia,  the  Federation  of  Australian  Muslim  Students

and Youth, the Australian Multicultural Eid Festival and Fair and the Muslim Community Cooperative

Australia.  Such  associations  are  active  in  organising  seminars,  conferences  and  various  activities

conducted  mostly  in  the  English  language,  and  inviting  Muslim  scholars  and  academics  increasingly

from America, Canada and the United Kingdom. Though some specific ethnic institutions continue to

hold  influence  among  migrants,  they are  increasingly eclipsed  by larger  umbrella  religiously oriented

organisations of the type described above.



Not  only  is  the  Muslim  Australian  minority  in  the  process  of  finding  its  voice  and  establishing  its

identity along an ethnic model, but such process is being sped up, as elsewhere in the West by a current

wave  of  Islamophobia  in  Australian  society.  Various  incidents  (mosque  burning  for  example,  attacks

on women wearing the hijab) have been documented but Islamophobia is particularly worrying in the

national media (radio, TV, written press). A number of newspapers and magazines articles have taken

Islamophobia  in  Australia  as  their  topic,  and  some  punctual  studies  have  been  undertaken  (Hage,  op.

cit.).  But  there  has  been,  to  my  knowledge,  no  independent  large  scale  survey  on  Islamophobia  in

Australia, though it certainly would be timely, though there is no doubt that Islamophobia is on the rise

in Australia and has sped up a process of ethnicisation of the Muslim Australian community.



Islamophobia and anti-discrimination laws: what is the problem?

Two possible paths to combat Islamophobia

So far, there are two paths to combat discrimination based on religion. The first is:

1) to include religion among the grounds covered by anti-discrimination laws. This is the path

that the European Union decided on in the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam.

“The Treaty of Amsterdam restates the principle of non-discrimination

in stronger terms, adding two new provisions to the EC Treaty.

The new Article 13

This  Article  complements  Article  12,  which  prohibits  discrimination  on

grounds  of  nationality.  The  new  Article  enables  the  Council  to  take

appropriate action to  combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic

origin,  religion  or  belief,  disability,  age  or  sexual  orientation.”

(http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/a10000.htm )

In addition, Articles 136 and 137 promotes measures to combat exclusion. This legislation is due to be

implemented  by  member  states  by  the  2nd  December  2003.  At  present,  few European  countries  have

appropriate legislation on discrimination based on religious grounds. Among those few:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ireland probably has the more encompassing legislation. The Equal Status Act (2000) prohibits

types  of  discrimination,  harassment  and  related  behaviour  in  connection  with  the  provision  of

services, property and other opportunities on the grounds of religious appurtenance.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  current  anti-discrimination  legislation  in  the  United  Kingdom,  does  not  cover  religious

appartenance  per  se  (except  for  Northern  Ireland  where  the  Fair  Employment  legislation

includes  religion  amongst  categories  under  which  it  is  unlawful  to  discriminate  in  respect  of

employment,  further  and  higher  education,  the  provision  of  goods,  facilities  and  services,  the

disposal  of,  and  management  of  premises).  However  the  Race  Relations  Act  (1998)  covers

discrimination  against  ethno-religious  groups  which  has  been  used  by  the  Commission  for

Racial  Equality  to  argue  that  religious  discrimination  in  effect  amounts  to  unlawful  indirect

racial discrimination against a particular racial group covered by the Race Relations Act (see

the CRE’s pamphlet: Religious Discrimination: Your rights, 1996)32.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In Austria,  civil  and  administrative  law  contains  provisions  prohibiting  public  expressions  of

prejudice against persons on the ground of religion or creed.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In Denmark,  the  1987  Penal  Code  provide  punishments  for  discrimination  and  harassment  on

the grounds of belief (Article 266b, Act 626 of 1987).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Finland’s Penal Code (1995, Section 9) details sentences for discrimination on the grounds of

religion

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In France  the  Penal  Code  (1985,  Art.  R-624-3,  4,  7)  punishes  verbal  hatred  on  grounds  of

religion.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Discrimination  on  grounds  of  religion  is  also  prohibited  and  punished  in  The  Netherlands

(Penal  Code  1992),  Norway  (Penal  Code  1981,  Paragraph  135a),  Sweden  (1987)  and  Spain

(1995).

However  even  the  new  legislation  does  not  include  clauses  designed  specifically  for  religious

vilification. There is a deep seated resistance to include religion per se among the grounds covered by

anti-discrimination  laws,  especially  when  it  comes  to  religious  vilification.  In  Australia,  only

Queensland (2001 Anti-Discrimination Amendment Act) and Victoria (Racial and Religious Tolerance

Act 2001) have religious vilification covered in their anti-discrimination law though South Australia is

considering doing so as well in spite of a considerable resistance mounted against including a religious

vilification clause in anti-discrimination laws, especially from some Christian quarters:

“The effect of this new law in Victoria - proclaimed in January this year -

quickly  became  apparent.  In  March,  a  Christian  group  held  a  seminar  on

Islam  in  a  Melbourne  church.  A  Christian  from  Pakistan  with  expert

knowledge  of  Islam,  explained  the  meaning  of  Islam's  holy  books  -  the

Qur'an  and  the  Hadith.  Three  Muslims  attended  parts  of  the  seminar  and

took  notes.  Their  distorted  and  inaccurate  account  formed  the  basis  of  a

formal complaint under the new law by the Islamic Council of Victoria. An

article by Andrew Bolt in the Herald  Sun (30/5/02, p 19) covers some of

the unfair claims against the seminar.

The  two  men  against  whom  the  complaint  was  made  have  since  spent

many hours attempting to prove themselves innocent. If they fail, they risk

serious fines. If they succeed, they receive no compensation for their time,

effort  or  legal  expenses.  In  contrast,  the  Islamic  Council  of  Victoria  has

nothing to lose - it simply had to make a complaint.

Peter and Jenny Stokes of Salt Shakers in Melbourne say Victorian pastors

are now reporting that some people are attending services - not to worship

-  but  to  monitor  what  is  said.  Are  we  heading  for  a  state  of  fear,  under

"thought police"?”

(http://www.pastornet.net.au/jmm/aasi/aasi0774.htm 18/7/02)

The  opposition  of  such  Christians  stems  from  their  understanding  of  religious  truth  and  of  their

proselyting duty:

The primary evil in anti racial legislation is that it subjugates Christianity

to the principles of a secular philosophy and makes it a criminal offence to

tell infidels, Moslems, Hindus, Buddhists and Jews that "salvation is found

in  no  one  else,  for  there  is  no  other  name  under  heaven  given  to  men  by

which we must be saved". (Acts 4:12)

http://www.reformation.to/persecution.htm



16   BLOUL,  Rachel

But  others  object  in  the  name  of  free  speech,  and  on  the  liberal  Western  ground  that  “religion  is  a

strictly  private  matter  that  must  be  kept  out  of  public  and  communal  life”   (Bunting  2001)33.  For

example,  Liberty,  a  UK  civil  rights  organisation,  while  it  supports  legislation  on  religious

discrimination, opposes an extension to religious hatred on the grounds that “religion isn’t an essential

part of an individual’s being as skin colour” and  that “while you can hide  your  religious beliefs, you

can’t do anything about your skin colour.” Such statements not only deny the communal dimension of

religion, they are also particular hypocritical promising Muslims tolerance as a reward for hiding their

religious beliefs.



Yet as mentioned above there are legitimate difficulties in legislating on religious discrimination. But,

meanwhile,  insulting  or  harassing  Muslim  women  wearing  the  hijab  is  not  an  offence.  Yet  it  is  well

known that most attacks against Islam in the European Union and Australia have been attacks triggered

by  visual  identifiers  most  often  embodied  by  Muslim  people  (hijab,  beards,  and  turbans)  but  also

recognizable  targets  like  mosques  and  Islamic  schools34.  Overwhelmingly,  women in hijab  have  been

the  preferred  targets,  which  is  not  a  promising  beginning  if  one  is  to  believe  in  Western  interest  in

liberating Muslim women. But of course such attacks have little to do with religious conviction. They

are, as notes the EUMC report, “Muslimphobic rather than Islamophobic”. In other words:

“…  religionism  and  xenophobia  become  interwoven…  [and]  blur  the

boundaries  where  anti-Islamic  and  anti-Muslim  fear  and  hatred  overlaps

with the fear and hatred of a euro-centrically perceived enemy ‘other’.”

(EUMC, Summary Report on Islamophobia, pp.38-9).



2) The second path would be to recognise this ethnicised nature of Islam in Western countries,

to recognise Islamophobia as a form of racism akin to antisemitism and to treat therefore Islam as an

ethno-religion in Western contexts.

Yet, even though Islamophobia is recognised as a specific racist phenomenon in Australia and the UK,

the cases history of NSW and UK anti-discrimination laws show how little possible it is for a Muslim

to  obtain  reparation.  For  example,  among  recent  cases  in  NSW  were  the  case  of  an  IT  worker

threatened with dismissal for praying, in his own time, at work; and that of a Muslim inmate unable to

obtain food respecting Muslim religious restrictions. So far, courts have dismissed such incidents as not

covered  by  anti-discrimination  laws35.  The  main  objections  have  been  that  Islam  covers  different

cultures, ethnicities, races, nationalities and  so  could  not be  defined  as an ‘ethno-religion’. As I have

argue  above  this  interpretation  is  far  too  limiting  and  does  not  take  into  account  the  ethnicisation  of

Muslim identity in Western countries. And certainly such an interpretation would be supported by an

impartial  comparison  with  antisemitism  as  defined  by  Wilhelm  Marr,  which  is  more  than  religious



33  Buntig, M. ‘The new anti-semitism’, The Guardian 3/12/01.  34  Summary Report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001, EUMC, pp. 35-9. Ghassan  Hage, op. cit.  35

As noted before, similar cases in the UK are usually filed under ‘indirect racial discrimination’ which  of course does not carry the same weight, and moreover subjected to case-by-case interpretation.

hatred (Jews hatred), aimed at the eradication of a people who is yet neither one racial or ethnic group,

nor really one culture or one nationality (see above).

Between a rock and a hard place?

Victims of Islamophobia find themselves between a rock (the difficulties inherent in legislating against

religious  discrimination  and  vilification)  and  a  hard  place  (the  reluctance  to  recognize  Islam  in  the

West  as  an  ethno-religious  category).  The  former  difficulties  reflect  the  uneasy  peace  between

secularism and universalist religions which have naturally problems to deal with “the shocking fact of

[religious]  ideological  pluralism”  as  illustrated  in  Christians’  opposition  to  religious  vilification  laws.

Advocates of free speech have legitimate concerns too, notably about the right to discuss and question

freely and publicly religious tenets, which is a concern that liberal secular advocates of religious anti-discrimination laws dismiss too lightly when they consider religion as ‘an intensely personal issue’ of

‘free  individual   religious  choice’.  The  usual  way  of  dealing  with  these  difficulties  is  to  develop  a

system  of  protections  and  exemptions  based  on  what  is  needed  for  a  religious  body  to  pursue  its

legitimate goals. No doubt this would require extensive negotiations (see for example the Salt Shakers

Special Report No1A, Racial and Religious Tolerance Bill Discussion Paper, December 2000).

It  would  seem  a  priori  simpler  to  accept  Islam  within  the  ranks  of  ethno-religions  within  Western

countries. This would have the merit to recognise the indisputably racist and xenophobic dimension of

Islamophobia.  As  mentioned  before,  it  is  opposed  by  certain  Jewish  militants  who  feel  insulted  by  a

comparison with antisemitism, on the grounds of the exceptionalism of the history of Jew hatred in the

West especially. Though this argument is valid emotionally in regard of the long history of persecution

of the Jews, it is not particularly congruent with Marr’s definition of antisemitism as a new,  modern,

political, ethnic or racial opposition to the Jews. Marr’s definition, if you replace ‘Jews’ by ‘Muslims’

certainly  applies  to  Islamophobia.  But  I  suspect  a  more  serious  obstacle  to  dealing  with  the  problem

under  the  ‘ethno-religious’  provision  is  that,  in  the  long  term,  it  just  does  not  confront  the  de  facto

religious  pluralism  that  has  become  a  fact  of  everyday  life  in  Western  societies.  Islam  with  its

competing  universalist  claims  has  come  to  stay.  We  cannot  demand  that  religious  citizens  should

conveniently bracket their religious beliefs when participating in social and political life, whatever their

religion.  But  that  does  not  mean  we  cannot  critically  engage  with  their  religiously  motivated

arguments. Just as we must learn to accept Islam, our Muslim co-citizens must learn to engage with our

different beliefs. Learning about the other seems a more promising beginning than verbally assaulting

them. And if one is to believe the Summary Report on Islamophobia in the EU, people seemed to have

done as much of the one as of the other36. Both reactions should encourage us in the difficult task of

setting up legal guidelines to deal with religious discrimination and vilification.
