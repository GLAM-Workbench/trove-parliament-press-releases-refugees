E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to thank Graham Lester and his team here at Pre-Cast Concrete Solutions for making Barnaby  Joyce and me so welcome this morning. This is one of the tens of thousands of Australian small businesses  which is going to be hit by the Prime Minister’s toxic tax. They use $3,000 worth of electricity a month,  they use about 70 tonnes of steel a month, they use about 30 tonnes of cement a month. Power, steel and  cement are all going up and up and up under the carbon tax. This is a company which is critically dependent  upon transport, transport in and transport out. Transport is going to go up and up and up under the carbon  tax.

Now, my message to the workers here and to the manufacturing workers of Australia right around our  country is: you are not on the wrong side of history. I think manufacturing does have a future as well as a  past in this country but that future is certainly going to be compromised if this carbon tax goes ahead.

Barnaby?

BARNABY JOYCE:

Thanks, Tony. Look, what you see in a place like this is men and women who have had a chance of  employment; and to be honest, some of them are probably doing it tough. They haven’t had the benefit that  Tony and I have had of going to uni and getting that education, but they are vital parts of our economy and  we must treat them with respect. You do not treat people with respect when you put them under threat of  their job. If jobs like these weren’t here, people don’t have the start-up jobs in life. In fact, it’s where Tony  started up and look what it did to him. So, what we’ve got to make sure is that we keep those people in a job  and I say to the Labor Party members, be independent. Be independent like Tony Windsor and Mr  Oakeshott and don’t vote for this. Stand up for your men. Stand up for your women. Stand up for the  working people of Australia and don’t vote for this insane tax because you know it’s wrong, you know in  your heart it’s wrong. Just don’t do it to them.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Any questions?

QUESTION:

Tony, a number of industry groups are saying that under your alternative approach carbon permits should be  able to be bought offshore: the Australian Greenhouse Industry Network, Business Council, even the  Minerals Council supports allowing permits to be bought offshore. Why won’t you allow that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the fact is that we are not actually reducing our emissions under the Prime Minister’s proposals. Under  the Prime Minister’s proposals Australia’s emissions don’t go down by five per cent by 2020, they go up  from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes. That’s roughly a ten per cent increase, it’s not a five per cent  decrease. So, if the Prime Minister is serious about reducing emissions this policy doesn’t do it.

QUESTION:

But are there any industry groups that agree with you on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point I make about our policy is that it’s funded, it’s costed and it’s capped. The whole point about  our policy is that it’s capped. We will spend up to $3.2 billion over the forward estimates period on our  direct action policy. We won’t spend a dollar more than that. So, this idea that our policy is going to cost  some astronomical figure is simply wrong.

QUESTION:

Even if that means not getting a five per cent reduction?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we are very confident that we can get at least the five per cent reduction by spending the money  because if you look at what’s happened in Australia over the last decade we have reduced our emissions  intensity by almost 50 per cent over the last decade-and-a-half. We’ve seen lots and lots of Australian  businesses reduce their emissions without a carbon tax by following sensible policies, sensible steps to  reduce their fuel and power use. Now, we are going to offer them encouragement to do more than that.

QUESTION:

On the Migration Act, a number of your MPs have different views on what you should do about the  Government’s bid to change the Migration Act. Do you have any predisposition before you get the briefing  on Friday?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point I have made is that Malaysia is bad policy. Malaysia is a proven failure. Since it was  announced there have been 1,000 illegal arrivals; since it was signed there have been 400 illegal arrivals.  The Prime Minister is already halfway towards the 800 cap and she has no plan B. That’s why I say  Malaysia is bad policy. Good policy is Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning boats around and if the  Prime Minister wants to put good policy in place she’ll get support from the Coalition but she can’t expect  the Coalition to support bad policy from a bad government.

QUESTION:

There are reports today that you’ll back the legislation if the PM asks nicely, if she says please?

TONY ABBOTT:

Our duty is to support good policy and Malaysia is not good policy.

QUESTION:

Are you going to get a meeting with the PM?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, that’s up to her. She’s normally pretty vituperative when we have our daily meeting in Question  Time. I’m not complaining, that’s her style. But the point I make is that our duty is to support the national  interest and we believe that the national interest is best secured by stopping the boats through Nauru,  temporary protection visas and turning boats around where it’s safe to do so.

QUESTION:

So is there any point in her meeting with you then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, if she wants us to support her policy she needs to take the appropriate steps and I’m saying to her that  if she wants us to support policy she’d better get her policy to resemble what we think is in the national  interest.

QUESTION:

The Greens have suggested that the briefing that you got from the Immigration Department that onshore  processing would cause civil unrest was a message given to them to pass on from the Minister for  Immigration. Did you feel like they were being untruthful with you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if this is the Government’s position why has it taken the Government so long to get away from  onshore processing? I mean, this is a Government which dismantled the policies that worked back in August  of 2008. The Prime Minister about a year ago belatedly said that she was a late convert to the idea of  offshore processing. We haven’t had any offshore processing in the last 12 months because the one place  where offshore processing could take place almost immediately, Nauru, is the one place that she refuses to  go to. Now, if the Prime Minister is serious about offshore processing why hasn’t she gone to Nauru before  now? Why won’t she go to Nauru now? If the Prime Minister wants to go to Nauru, I will back her 100 per  cent of the way.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] back the legislation anyway?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m sorry, it is not the duty of the Opposition to support bad policy from a bad government. If this

policy change, if this legislation is so important why isn’t it Bob Brown’s responsibility to support it? Let’s  face it, he is the co-prime minister of the country. Let’s face it, he has undertaken to support the Government  in its vital legislation.

Thanks so much.
