COMMENT FROM DR RICHARD DI NATALE, LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN GREENS:

"This White Paper was the perfect opportunity to reassess Australia's relationship with the United

States but instead, the Turnbull Government has doubled down on a bad bet," Di Natale said.

"We are keeping all our eggs in the US basket when we should recognise that the alliance is making

us less safe, not more. Under Turnbull and Bishop, our ties with Trump's US will grow; we will see

more US troops on our soil, more warships in our ports, more billion dollar white elephant military

purchases, more support for nuclear weapons and more ill-advised military adventurism.

"This White Paper shows that while the Government recognises the global threat of climate change,

it completely fails to make the connection that our inaction at home is critical to our reputation and

influence abroad. If the Government really wants to step up engagement with our Pacific

neighbours, then the best thing it can do is stop mining and burning coal and show some global

leadership on climate change."

"There's a great irony that as the Government launched its Foreign Policy White Paper, refugees

were being forcibly removed from Australia's inhumane offshore detention camps and dumped into

unfinished, insecure accommodation. A values-based foreign policy is critical, but Australia is

projecting the wrong values. We are retreating on human rights, on climate change, on aid and on

refugees."

"It's very disappointing that the White Paper doesn't recognise the need to increase Australia's aid

contributions from their historically low levels."
