E&OE



AARON KEARNEY: As the Hunter prepares to be beamed to an audience of billions  and perhaps even more importantly, to host thousands of tourists in early 2015, when  the Asian Cup Football Tournament comes to town, preparations to ensure that we  deliver a world-class event continue to escalate. We have been keeping a close eye on it  and key stakeholders in tourism, events and sport met yesterday in the Hunter. Today,  the Federal Sports Minister, Kate Lundy, is in town for a range of meetings and it is all  focused around the Hunter's two-week stint. Effectively we are in the spotlight for two  weeks in early January of 2015, which on 1 May, is coming very fast. It's the very start of  2015 so we're not much more than 18 months away.

The Minister had high level meetings yesterday as well with the head of the  World Anti-Doping Agency regarding Australia's handling of the drugs in sport issue. And  the Federal Minister for Sport and Multicultural Affairs, Kate Lundy, joins us in the studio.  Good morning, welcome.

KATE LUNDY:          Good morning, Aaron.

AARON KEARNEY: As I said, lots of issues to keep you busy in Canberra but you have  come here today - why has this climbed to the top of the agenda?

KATE LUNDY:          Well, Newcastle's in a really special place. It's fantastic this city is  hosting the Asian Football Cup games that you are. I think it's a real credit to Newcastle  that you've been able to not only pitch up to the organising committee, but win some  fantastic games with two group rounds and a semi-final and a play-off between the third  and fourth.

And I think it augurs really well for a city the size of Newcastle to show that  they're, you know, you're fully capable of being able to host these international events.

AARON KEARNEY: That said, I'm aware and we have as I mentioned, chronicled at  length here and continue to do so, a real sense of sit up and take notice - here's our  chance…

KATE LUNDY:          Yeah.

AARON KEARNEY: … to make a good show of ourselves. Because the reality is, we  are overlooked often. We're not on this occasion so nobody wants to get it wrong. What  are the key hopes and concerns as you see it for the Hunter hosting these games?

KATE LUNDY:          Well, I think one of the key things is building that community  support. You know, an event like this for Australia means a number of things. First of all,  it's the benefit that the event has itself. It's the inspiration it provides to kids who want to  play soccer who perhaps do play soccer. But it's also about the economic benefit that it  does bring to our cities and regions. And sport tourism and event tourism is huge. It can  do enormous things for not only gearing up your local infrastructure. You know, we're  putting in 10 million into the Hunter Stadium, for example. But that's a great motivation  for all of your hotels, your venue managers and so forth to use that as a focus.

And then there's the legacy benefit. Where do you take that next once you've put  in all of that work and that investment? And the community's got behind it. So it's a multi-layered thing, it's not just about sport. It's about business, it's about tourism, it's about  economic growth and it's about community building and inspiring our kids to play sport.

AARON KEARNEY: Surely one of the key manage… challenges of any level of  government, is to match the infrastructure to the private sector and to make sure that  everything grows and contracts at a similar level. We had a stadium that was badly  behind world's best practice for a very long time - is now pretty much at the pointy end of  that. It would seem to me that our challenge is whether the private sector has the  infrastructure to accommodate an event of this magnitude.

KATE LUNDY:          Well, look that's right. It's never going to be just a public event.  We're very happy to support it. The Federal Government's putting in $30 million but the  states are also contributing significantly to the hosting of this event. And so it is about  everyone stepping up and I think the feeling I've got around certainly the Eastern  Seaboard that's sponsoring this event, is that the willingness is there. They understand  the benefit of this kind of event and what it can bring to an economy. And I think the  lesson out of other big events we've held - Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, of  course Olympic Games in Sydney, is the legacy. You have to be smart about that. You  have to look at what comes next.

AARON KEARNEY: On that, I'm not sure if you're aware or not as Federal Sports  Minister, of an ambition to put together a bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games. It is  widely considered and we've had conversations with the Commonwealth Games  Association; that's widely considered the next reasonable shot that Australia would have  at a Commonwealth Games. The Gold Coast is an area of comparable size to the  Hunter. We do come up short on certain infrastructure milestones. However, are you  aware of the bid and would you consider that albeit the chances of you being the sports  minister in 2030 are…

KATE LUNDY:          Very small.

AARON KEARNEY: Indeed.

KATE LUNDY:          Look, I think it's a great idea and just consistent with what I was  talking about. It is about preparing a long-term vision for a region. I think sports  infrastructure will continue to ascend in relative importance in what, you know, healthy,  strong, resilient communities look like. We know from all of the research that having  facilities at both the grass roots and the elite level contribute significantly to the - not just  the well-being of the community, but I think the - how a community feels about itself and  its view of itself going forward.

And so I think it's a worthy ambition and I think it's great that you're thinking  about it now. It's a long way away. We've got an Australian-hosted Commonwealth  Games in the meantime, so you've got a great case study to absorb some lessons from  and observe. And I think that augurs well for Newcastle's quite worthy ambitions, so  good luck.

AARON KEARNEY: And I know you run these sort of calculations privately, if not how  you always articulate them publicly. And that is, for a city like Melbourne or Sydney to  interrupt itself and an international city like that to interrupt itself, they need to be talking  world cup football or Olympic level events in order to cause that level of disruption.  Things like the Asian Cup, like the Commonwealth Games, and various other - I hesitate  to call them second tier but they're not the Olympics or the World Cup, are our  opportunity, are they not?

KATE LUNDY:          Look, they are and there's a reason that these events are, you  know, are competed for, that there's a great rivalry across our states. Our state  governments take very seriously their ability to host and hold events and some of the  annual events that are conducted in cities around Australia. Obviously the Australian  Open in Melbourne - the enormous investment made in the tennis infrastructure to host  the Australian Open - why? - because they see the massive benefit both economically  but also the showcase that provides for Melbourne around the world.

And I think that there is a growing maturity across not just our state and federal  governments about it. For example, we've now got a Major Events Taskforce within the  federal office for sport. But regions have understood for a long time the economic  benefits of major events, sports and the tourism.

AARON KEARNEY: And I think stakes are even higher because a city like Melbourne  has high international name recognition and a city like Newcastle, not necessarily.

KATE LUNDY:          Well, it is an opportunity to put your name on the map and get that  international exposure. You don't - I don't think you can put a value on the images that  are beamed around the world of a well-hosted sporting event. The association becomes  very positive. You link that into a tourism campaign targeting your region - you know, got  clever people out there doing that already. It's about linking it all together.

AARON KEARNEY: The Federal Minister for Sport and Multicultural Affairs and Minister  Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Kate Lundy, is our guest in the studio. It is twenty  five past seven. You're with Aaron Kearney on 1233 Breakfast.

How was the meeting with the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency yesterday?

KATE LUNDY:          That was excellent. WADA have been very supporting, obviously,  of ASADA's work here. The ASADA investigation is continuing, as I think everyone  knows, and it was good to have the opportunity to talk through not just, you know, the  outcomes of Project Aperio on the current investigation, but particularly the ongoing  review into the WADA code.

That is currently under review and Australia has a strong view about the  increased emphasis on investigations under the WADA code. We feel very strongly and I  think both the USADA report into Lance Armstrong and what we're currently  experiencing shows that investigations are a critical part of our fight against drugs in  sport.

AARON KEARNEY: Are you happy with how events have been handled post the Crime  Commission's announcement? There are a lot of people who have reputations that are

important to them who are effectively walking around with vague accusations hanging  over their head while trying to execute a football season or whatever else. Are you  satisfied it has been handled well?

They have not been afforded certain privileges that are afforded to people who  are charged with paedophilia, murder, and other ostensibly far worse crimes.

KATE LUNDY:          Well, what we're dealing with here is a process under the ASADA  legislation that allows investigations to unfold. I think one of the key points in all of this is  that it is appropriate to let that process unfold in due course. And ASADA are doing  everything they can to conduct the investigation as quickly as possible.

AARON KEARNEY: But until those who have done wrong are named under the  investigation, then everybody carries that burden.

KATE LUNDY:          Well, I would contend that because it's one thing to have this issue  reported on like it's affecting everybody. My view is this. There's only one group of  people that this investigation's tarnishing and that is the drug cheats. Like everybody, the  sooner it is dealt with, the better. So, that feeling that everyone's, you know, in the same  room can be resolved.

But the reason this needs to be done is out of respect for every clean athlete,  ever kid that aspires to play footy of whatever code. We have a responsibility to do that. I  think everyone understands clearly now that the issues raised in the Australian Crime  Commission report are incredibly serious and unprecedented in this country and we  must act. And the sooner we can move through the investigation, I think, the more  comfortable everyone will be.

It's uncomfortable now and I empathise greatly with both fans and those athletes  who've been clean all their lives very much. But the best way to resolve it is to get  through this investigation. That requires the cooperation of everyone involved.

AARON KEARNEY: Widespread suggestions today that we're getting a new tax later  today. Can you confirm?

KATE LUNDY:          No, I can't confirm. It's funny, you know, the media's taken that -  this, of course, talking about the prospects of how we fund the NDIS, the National  Disability…

AARON KEARNEY: Possibly through a Medicare levy.

KATE LUNDY:          Yeah. I think the media's already decided. I'm going to wait for the  Prime Minister's announcement.

AARON KEARNEY: Very briefly, because we are coming up to a news commitment, but  in your other portfolio, Multicultural Affairs, we are constantly hearing about immigration.  Is multiculturalism still working in Australia?

KATE LUNDY:          Oh look, of course. And, you know, to even question it - it's really  important. We've got lots of debates and contentious issues about immigration. The  Labor Government is committed to maintaining a very orderly migration system. We're  working through many asylum seekers. That - don't conflate that with the success of our  multicultural community.

AARON KEARNEY: Well, indeed - and that is my question.

KATE LUNDY:          Yeah.

AARON KEARNEY: Where do the portfolios, slash the issues, rub together?

KATE LUNDY:          Well, they rub together because people associate our migration  program with the outcome of that, which is a fabulous multicultural society. But the  negativity with some of, you know, I think the responses to asylum seekers and some of  the, I think unfortunate reflection on how that's unfolded has nothing to do with I think  what is the universal or bipartisan support for a multicultural society.

This is something that successive governments are committed to. We have  fabulous public policy and programs that have sustained our very positive  multiculturalism for generations now and I'm really -, my role with both Multicultural  Affairs and Sports is a wonderful crossover. You've got sport being the best platform for  social inclusion. And I think one of the reasons we're so great at sport is because we're  so multicultural.

AARON KEARNEY: Yeah. No doubt. How's morale in the ALP right now?

KATE LUNDY:          We know we've got a fight on our hands, but I can tell you this; we  are very focused. We've got a great story to tell when it comes to managing the  economy in extraordinarily difficult circumstances and with revenues taking a dive, we do  have to reshape the budget. That's our focus and we'll be getting our message out to the  Australian people and asking for their support in September.

AARON KEARNEY: We appreciate the time and access this morning. Welcome to  Newcastle, good luck with your meetings today, and we hope we'll do you all proud in  January 2015. Thank you, Kate Lundy.

KATE LUNDY:          I look forward to it. Thank you.

AARON KEARNEY: The Federal Minister for Sport and Multicultural Affairs and Minister  Assisting for Industry and Innovation in the Hunter today for a series of talks about,  amongst other things, the upcoming Asian Cup games in this city.
