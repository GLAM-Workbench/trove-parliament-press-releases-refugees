Govt to deport East Timorese asylum seekers

Democrats say "DON'T BREAK UP FAMILIES"

Australian Democrat Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett has condemned a decision by the  Immigration Minister to reject humanitarian visas for East Timorese settled in Australia.

About 11 East Timorese in Melbourne and about 10 in Sydney, were told yesterday they had been  unsuccessful in their claims for humanitarian visas, despite many of them having the same claims as people  accepted previously.

In one case the 3 children of a family were all born in Australia and the whole family has been rejected in their  attempt to stay. In another case the East Timorese wife of an Australian resident has been rejected.

"It is appalling that the Government is seeking to break up families and deport children who were born here,"  Senator Bartlett said.

"There are few countries in the world where this would happen.

"I urge the Minister to reconsider the decision," Senator Bartlett said.
