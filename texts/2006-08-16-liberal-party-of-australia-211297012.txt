Latest Refugee and Humanitarian Arrivals to Australia

“Australia this week welcomes more than 200 refugee and humanitarian entrants,  including some people assessed as being amongst the most in need of resettlement,”  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said today.

“1 03 of the 21 1 people arriving this week are refugees who have been waiting patiently in  refugee camps for many years after having been assessed by the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as being most in need of resettlement.

“Since Monday, 42 people have arrived and another 169 are due by the end of Sunday.

“These are all entrants under Australia’s refugee and humanitarian programme which  provides 13,000 places each year.

“The UNHCR currently lists Australia as the second largest resettlement country and  consistently in the top three, with Canada and the US.

“Australia is able to offer this level of protection, in part, because of our commitment to  maintaining tough border security, ensuring that places available go to those assessed by  the UNHCR to those most in need.

“Some of the children have only known life inside a refugee camp with no running water or  power.

“There are 70 family groups amongst this weeks arrivals, including 13 women arriving  under a dedicated programme for women at risk. This includes women who have lost  male family members and are therefore considered particularly vulnerable.”

The refugee and humanitarian entrants arriving this week will settle across Australia as  follows:
