INTERVIEW WITH STEVE PRICE

MELBOURNE TALK RADIO

15 JULY 2010

SUBJECTS: Economic Update; return to surplus; employment  outcomes; MRRT revenues; Liberals opposing business tax cuts,  superannuation increase and infrastructure investment; asylum-seekers debate

PRICE:

Wayne Swan, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer yesterday re-released revised Budget forecast figures. He's on the line. Thanks for your  time. I'm not sure whether to call you Treasurer or Deputy PM now.

TREASURER:

Just call me Wayne.

PRICE:

I knew you were going to say that. Why did you release the forecasts  now? I mean, what was the timing behind that?

TREASURER:

Well, a variety of reasons - principally the debate in the international  economy in the last month or so, which has been pretty furious, about  Europe; the uncertainty that that has produced in global financial markets  and stock markets; and the feedback of that into this country. I thought it  was important to provide an update on the economy generally, and as  you also know, there's been a debate about the mining tax and revenues  and so on. So I thought it was a good opportunity to draw both those  threads together and to go through the underlying financial position of the  country and our growth outlook, because it's all pretty good. And that's  why I put the material out yesterday. We've done this before as well.  There's been two other updates outside the formal Budgets we give and  the MYEFOs we give.

PRICE:

Unusual to come so close on the heels of a Budget though, isn't it?

TREASURER:

Yes it is, but what has been unusual has been the global economy Steve,  and particularly in the last two and a half years. We have provided  updates and I think it was pretty important to explain to the Australian  people that we're coming back to budget in three years, three years  early, a pretty strong position and the job position here very strong -  350,000 jobs created in the past year. There's no other developed  economy who can look to a record like that. But I thought it was pretty  important to reinforce that.

PRICE:

Is it fair as The Australian has done today to add together the $1.5 billion  figure which was the bonus talked about to the miners when you revised  the tax and then take your fresh figures from yesterday and come up with  a figure of $7. 5 billion?

TREASURER:

Well, they're comparing apples and pears. The fact is that we've got a  new tax which raises in total $10.5 [billion]. The old tax that we put  forward raised $12 [billion] and there are a couple of reasons for that.  Because we've got a completely new tax it does raise less, before you get  the commodity prices, than the previous one. But when you throw in  updated commodity prices the difference between the two amounts of  money is $1.5 [billion]. But if you want to have a hypothetical calculation  like they have, you can come up with any number of numbers, and they  have.

PRICE:

I think what's important for voters as opposed to miners, they would like  to know now, with these revised figures, with commodity prices it appears  again on the rise, what impact is that going to have on interest rates?  What impact is it likely to have on inflation?

TREASURER:

Well, I think the most important impact is we are able to deliver with this  revenue that big tax cut to small business, the $5000 instant write-off.  We're able to deliver a cut in the company tax rate. We're able to deliver  the boost to superannuation and infrastructure. But when it comes to  inflation, what the Government is doing is everything we can to invest in  the capacity of the economy to keep downward pressure on inflation. But  as you know, the Reserve Bank takes its decisions independently. But

those measures I was talking about before Steve, they're measures the  Liberals are going to block. They're now saying they don't want any of the  revenue from the mining tax and they're going to stand in the way of the  tax cuts for small business, for company tax more generally and the boost  to super. It's quite incredible that they could take that position.

PRICE:

Well, in an election you'll be reminding everybody of that. You'll also be  reminding people that you think that you can get the Budget back to  surplus by 2012/2013 by a bigger margin than you said.

TREASURER:

Yes that's right. It's a modest increase in the surplus we forecast at the  Budget and it has principally come about because of our spending  restraint. It's not principally delivered by increases in terms of revenues  from the mining industry, because what we're doing is with the money  form the new tax is we're devoting it to those important reforms. What's  really delivering the surplus is the fiscal discipline that the Government  has put in place and we put in place last year when we had to move to  stimulate the economy to keep the economy out of recession. And we're  coming back now to surplus in three years, three years early, principally  because of that fiscal discipline and the fact that we are able to keep  unemployment down.

PRICE:

How rubbery are the figures when you consider that they are so different  yesterday than they were a fortnight or a month ago?

TREASURER:

Well, the figures have changed…

PRICE:

Can we have faith in the Treasury?

TREASURER:

I think we can. Look, the figures have changed when it comes to a couple  of the big bulk commodities in which there have been substantial  increases. The contract negotiations recently were important. We also had  new figures out post-Budget from an organisation called ABARE which  provided new figures, and there was also discussions with the companies  about the outlook. The fact is we are moving into a new era. The global

economy is going to be increasingly driven by growth in our region and  that is very good news for commodity producers…

PRICE:

It's pretty hard to get a handle on it though because Ross Greenwood was  talking to one of the mining industry analysts last night on prices where  he said iron ore prices have been down for the last six weeks.

TREASURER:

Yes but that's the last six weeks. We're talking here about a tax beginning  in 2012/2013. What we've got to do is get a handle on where they're  going over the long-term. So you know that's not a valid comparison at  all. What we do, and what the mining companies do, and what other  analysts do is they look at the trend and the fact is that in the data we  produced yesterday, what's called the terms of trade for Australia are  going to be much higher as we go forward than they've been historically.  That's the point. That's great for Australia and that's one of the reasons  why we needed to put in place this Minerals Resource Rent Tax.

PRICE:

Had those figures altered your thinking on an election - timing wise?

TREASURER:

No they haven't impacted on any of those decisions. I don't take that  decision, the Prime Minister takes that decision. What's most important  for us is to get the reform program in place because we know that not  everybody out there is doing as well as some. And whilst we are in the  mining boom mark II, there are many people who aren't doing as well as  others. And we've also got to make sure that we can give a boost to small  business in that environment, make them more competitive and also build  up the super savings of people particularly on lower incomes.

PRICE:

Is Senator Chris Evans right when he says the asylum seeker debate is  killing you as a Government?

TREASURER:

Well, I think the Prime Minister acknowledged a week or so ago that this  has been a difficult debate, that we needed some plain speaking about it  and that's what the Prime Minister has been doing, and I think that's what  Chris may have been referring to.

PRICE:

So it's killing you, do you think?

TREASURER:

Look, I believe that what we have to do is to talk plainly to the Australian  people about this challenge and other challenges. We spoke very plainly  to the Australian people about the challenge of the global recession, what  we needed to do about it and the Australian community came together  pretty well there, so much to the point that we've got job creation in this  country to the tune of 350,000 in the past year, a simply stunning result.  And those are difficult challenges, we do need to keep talking to the  Australian people.

PRICE:

The President of Nauru says we're open for business, come back.

TREASURER:

Well, I'm not up with the President of Nauru. I will leave that to my  colleagues to deal with him.

PRICE:

Alright thanks for your time Deputy Prime Minister, Treasurer, also known  as Wayne.

TREASURER:

Good on you.
