STATEMENT   FOR PRESS

The funds available for lending under the Commissioner for Housing

loan scheme in 1979/80 will be approximately $22 million. Of this

$14.6 million has been appropriated in the Budget with the balance

becoming, available from recirculating funds in the Commissioner for

Housing Trust Account.

This will enable over 900 loans to be made this year compared

with about 740 last year.

The allocation of funds compares with total loans made in 1978/79

of $l6.5'million comprising an appropriation in the.Budget of

$8.9 million and recirculating funds of $7.6 million.

Of the $22 million available this year 60fo will be for the purchase

of new homes and 40$  for previously owned houses.

It is expected that total rents paid by tenants of government

accommodation in Canberra will drop slightly in 1979/80. This will

be because of the expected decrease in the housing stock due to

sales of government houses to tenants.

The estimates anticipate that $20.3 million, including rental rebates

subsidy of $4.46 million, will be paid in rents by tenants of

government houses in 1979/80. In 1978/79 total rents received were

$20.7 million, including $3.6 million from rental rebates subsidy.

administered by the Department of the Capital Territory. Of these

7,688 were homes and 3>253 were flats. Ã¢ÂÂ
