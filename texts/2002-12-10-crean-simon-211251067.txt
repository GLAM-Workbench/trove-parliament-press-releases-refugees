LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY



SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION   THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB  CANBERRA  TUESDAY DECEMBER 10 2002

It’s a shame this speech coincided with the Prime Minister’s XI cricket match,  but by the size of our audience here today it looks like England batted first.

The first twelve months

It’s been a difficult twelve months - for me, the party and the nation.

But it’s been a tougher twelve months for Australian families.

I want to change things for them, and for the better.

It’s  useful  to  reflect  on  the  year  twelve  months  after  I  took  over  the   leadership.

I said at the beginning I wanted a strong economy - not as an end in itself,  but for a fair society.

I wanted us to propose, not oppose.

I wanted us to become more tolerant, compassionate, reconciled at home and  re-engaged  in  the  region  and,  through  it,  punching  above  our  weight   influencing the international agenda, not following it blindly.

I  argued  that  we  had  to  modernise,  not  to  ditch  our  values,  but  to   contemporise them.

What do they mean to people in the first decade of 2000?

The modernisation had to start with us, the Labor Party.

Let’s look at the first twelve months.

We  have  a  Government’s  whose  deceit  was  exposed  over  ‘Kids  Overboard’   and  the  budget,  whose  divisiveness  was  on  show  through  the  ‘Kirby  Affair’,   and whose judgement was questioned over the ‘Hollingworth Affair’.

Against  this  background,  I  ensured  a  Labor  Party  with  a  rejuvenated   frontbench, showing a difference on key issues:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Kids out from behind the razor wire;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Population policy;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Reforming the Parliament;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Fixed four-year terms in both Houses;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An independent Speaker;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Paid Maternity Leave;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Stopping  the  30  per  cent  hike  on  pharmaceuticals  and  proposing

costed alternatives;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Stopping cuts to Disability benefits;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Children’s Commissioner for the protection of our kids from potential

sex abuse;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Community Safety Zones to make our streets safer;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Re-engagement with Asia;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Visiting China; and,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Defining our alliance with the United States.

And that’s just the beginning.

None of them timid, no ‘me-too-ism’ about these.

Nor was facing up the difficult position in the party easy.

I said twelve months ago that reform of the party and a new policy on asylum  seekers would be completed by the end of the year.

They were.

Internal party reform was necessary, but distracting.

It  did  take  too  long,  but  what  it  demonstrated  was  that  we  were  a  party   about greater openness, greater democratic values, greater fairness, greater  inclusion.  And why? Not just again as an end in itself but if I am to project  those  values  in  terms  of  how  I  want  to  lead  the  nation,  I’ve  got  to   demonstrate I am serious about it internally and I was.

So as distracting whatever length of time it took it was necessary and it was  necessary to do it in the first year.

Page 2

I  indicated  at  the  beginning  that  the  path  to  winning  was  build  around  the   three R’s.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Reform;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Renewal; and,   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Re-electing the party to government - as the only party which through  its  values,  its  belief  in  people’s  rights,  and  its  belief  in  fairness  can

deliver a better outcome for all Australians, not just the few.

I’ll come to those issues in a moment.

But the year has, of course, been dominated by Iraq and the Bali bombings,  leading with the War on Terror coming closer to home.

On  security  and  border  protection,  John  Howard  has  simply  played  on  that   insecurity.

He hasn’t addressed it.

I understand the insecurity, but also that it must be addressed.

That’s  why,  on  border  protection,  under  Labor  you’d  have  the  Coastguard;   the Green Card; the stiffer penalties for people smugglers; the engagement  with our region.

That’s why, on terrorism, I proposed tougher penalties for terrorists, but not  turning into a police state; a Department of Home Affairs; a Regional Summit  of Leaders.

But  this  spirit  of  regional  cooperation  has  been  compromised  by  Howard’s   new doctrine of pre-emptive strikes.

How  can  you  build  a  peace  in  the  region  with  provocative  language  about   war?



I’m  also  announcing  Labor’s  plan  for  an  Office  of  National  Security,  with  a   National  Security  Adviser  directly  reporting  to  the  PM,  coordinating  a  policy   view  on  resource  and  funding  priorities  across  the  whole  of  our  intelligence   and security communities.

The  Australian  Strategic  Policy  Institute  (ASPI)  has  talked  of  the  lack  of   central coordination advice to the Head of Government.  I will establish it.

As  a  country  of  20  million  people  in  a  region  of  3  ½  billion,  the  logic  of   comprehensive engagement is inescapable.

But relations under this Government with our region are not good.

Page 3

Our alliance with the US must remain at the core of our security, but it’s not  incompatible with a strong independent foreign policy.

Independence within a strong alliance is what I will deliver.

I want Australia to lead, not follow.

We are a more valuable alliance partner when we’re fully engaged, informed  and  involved  in  our  region.   We  also  build  a  stronger  capacity  to  influence   world opinion.

I will also ensure that we are a consistent supporter of the authority of the  UN  and  the  role  of  international  law  in  delivering  peace  and  security.   Not   using the UN only when it suits us.

That’s why I’ve insisted since the beginning of the year that the Iraq question  must be dealt with through the UN Security Council.

What Howard has done to Australian families…

Despite the issue of national security, there are serious concerns about living  standards.

It’s not just winning the war; we must win the peace as well.

John  Howard  wants  Australians  to  concentrate  exclusively  on  national   security, because he won’t concentrate on standards of living and the quality  of life.

We’re constantly being told that the economy is booming.

B u t  i f  t h i n g s  a r e  g o i n g  s o  w e l l ,  w h y  a r e  s o  m a n y  p e o p l e  a s k i n g  ‘ w h y  a m  I   being left behind?’

During  the  course  of  2002  one  of  the  big  public  policy  debates  has  been   about why our nation’s birth rate is declining.

But  I  ask  you,  is  it  any  wonder  our  birth  rate  is  declining  when  Australians   simply can’t afford to start a family or have that second or third child?

Just look at the legacy of the Government.

Australians are now paying more tax than ever before.

Housing has never cost more.

Household debt and credit card debt are at record levels.

Page 4

And  to  pay  off  their  record  debts,  Australian  workers  are  now   working longer hours and spending less time with their kids.  Of all  the developed countries, only South Koreans work longer.

John  Howard  said  the  GST  was  a  tax  on  consumption  but  we  now   have the lowest level of savings ever.

The cost of raising a child is steadily increasing.

In fact, last year the cost of childcare alone rose over 17 percent.

The  cost  of  seeing  the  family  doctor  is  soaring  because  finding  a   doctor who bulk bills has never been more difficult.

If working longer hours wasn’t bad enough, John Howard wants to  make it easier to sack people.

And despite the fact that people are living longer and retiring earlier  nothing  is  being  done  to  improve  superannuation  and  retirement   incomes.

While  ordinary  Australians  can’t  escape  paying  their  fair  share  of   tax,  many  of  the  well  off  have  access  to  crooked  tax  minimization   schemes.

No  wonder  Australians  increasingly  believe  that  there  is  one  set  of   standards for the ordinary Australian and another for the elite.

The next 12 months…

So over the next 12 months we will be outlining clear directions and  detailed  policies  that  connect  with  the  priorities  and  the  strong   values held by the great majority of the Australian people.

There’s  a  view  around  at  present  that  says  that  only  the  parties  on  the   extremes of the political spectrum have strong values and convictions.

In  this  narrow  view  of  the  world  in  which  there  is  no  place  for   alternate  views  -  you  are  either  for  the  Coalition  and  their  harsh   right-wing agenda, or the Greens and their hard left-wing agenda.

But  these  are  false  choices.   False  because  the  vast  majority  of   Australians are neither strongly left nor right.

And to accuse them of not holding strong values is an insult to every  one of those Australians.

Page 5

Today  I  want  to  reclaim  for  my  party  the  ground  held  by  an   overwhelming majority of Australians.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australians who believe that we can fight terrorism but not by  becoming a police state to do it.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australians who believe that we must protect our borders but  treat asylum seekers decently.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australians who believe that there is a role for private health  insurance without destroying Medicare or bulk billing.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australians  who  support  a  parent’s  right  to  choose  their   children’s  school  but  who  know  that  the  nation  needs  high   quality public education.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And Australians who believe that we can help the environment  - by signing the Kyoto Protocol - without destroying jobs.

Labor's  policies  will  be  unashamedly  focussed  on  the  difficulties  being   experienced by Australians in their every day lives.

And like Australians, Labor recognises that while governments don't have all  the answers, we do know that together we can make a difference.

Medicare

Labor will start by saving Medicare and we will stop punitive increases in the  costs of medicines.

Only Labor believes that Australians are entitled to the security that a quality  universal  public  health  care  system  provides.   We  established  it  under   Whitlam and Hawke.

But bulk billing has collapsed under the Howard Government - down from 80  percent in 1996 to just 71 percent today.

John  Howard  always  said  that  he  would  pull  Medicare  apart.   Now  he's   watching it bleed.

We must save Medicare and restore bulk billing.  If that means we  have to look again at the Private Health Insurance Rebate - with all  its inefficiencies and rorts - we won't be afraid to do it.

Education for all

Page 6

In education, the Liberals have spent the last six years opening doors for the  f a v o u r e d  f e w ,  s l a m m i n g  t h e m  i n  t he  face  of  those  without  money  and   privilege.

They  did  it  by  under-investing  in  our  public  schools  and  universities.   They   want to do it again with their proposal to deregulate university fees.

My  leadership  will  be  dedicated  to  unlocking  the  doors  to  new  skills  and   knowledge so we can give every Australian the opportunities they need.

Labor’s education policies will create of a national system of lifelong learning  accessible  to  all  on  the  basis  of  need  and  ability  -  from  early  learning   programs to universities.

Lifelong learning is critical.  While we can no longer guarantee everyone with  a job for life, we can try to make everyone employable for life.

I  want  every  child  to  achieve  the  equivalent  of  a  year-12   qualification.

Our  young  people  must  be  given  the  choice  between  a  job,  a  university  or   TAFE place or some other form of structured training.  Unemployment will  not be an option.



And I give this pledge - Labor will never support the deregulation of  university  fees  because  they  will  lock  thousands  of  talented   Australians out of higher education.

Higher retirement incomes for all

People  are  retiring  earlier  and  living  longer.   This  makes  improving   superannuation a national priority.

Superannuation  was  only  spread  to  the  whole  of  the  workforce  because  of   Labor.  We  are  the  only  party  that’s  going  to  improve  those  benefits  in  the   future.

Labor will be announcing new policies that improve the adequacy of  superannuation and protect the investments or working Australians.

Labor has always been the party of pensioners, and I want to make  it the party for superannuants as well.

Part of this will involve ensuring that the investments of every Australian are  protected by a strong system of corporate regulation.

Page 7

More than 50 percent of Australians now own shares.  With over 90 percent  of  people  now  in  super  funds  thanks  to  Labor’s  initiatives  just  about  every   employee owns shares indirectly.

So  we’d  all  be  safer  in  a  system  with  tighter  rules,  greater   transparency  and  a  code  in  which  integrity  is  taken  as  the  norm.   That’s what Labor will introduce.

Modernising our economy

The  key  to  creating  this  better  future  for  all  Australians  is  improving  our   productivity growth.

We have to create new industries and make our old industries new again.

That’s why we’ll have strong industry and trade policies to better realise the  nation’s potential.

The Howard Government’s vision is effectively low-wage, low-skill economy.

In the last three years, of the 650,000 jobs that have been created under this  Government, only 700 of them pay average weekly earnings.  Middle income  earning in this country is disappearing.

We’ve got to develop a high-skill knowledge economy, but one that also has  wage justice for the low skilled.

And it is also a sustainable economy.

Sustainability  is  not  a  choice  between  creating  wealth  and  protecting  the   environment.

The  challenges  of  climate  change,  salinity  and  water  quality  present   opportunities  for  Australian  industry  with  growing  international  markets  for   environmental goods and services.

I f  w e  l e a d  t h e  w a y ,  t h i s  m e a n s  j obs,  investment  and  opportunities  for   Australia, particularly in our regions.

That’s  why  Labor  will  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  on  climate  change,   introduce  emissions  trading  and  drive  innovation  in  emission   reduction technologies.

And  it’s  why  Labor  will  develop  a  national  water  policy  -  a  plan  to   save our rivers, drive investment and renew our regional economies.

Page 8

To  modernise  our  economy,  greater  effort  is  needed  to  boost  R&D,   skill formation, capital expenditure and broadband connectivity - all  of which have stagnated or declined under the Howard Government.

Labor will also pursue activist trade policies.

While  there  will  always  be  opportunities  in  our  traditional  markets,  there  is   enormous  opportunity  in  China  and  the  Asian  region,  but  only  with  a   government prepared to open those markets up.

Valuing our families

Rather than lecturing family values, Labor will value Australian families.

John Howard talks a lot about issues like paid maternity leave but he has no  intention of doing anything about it.

In the New Year, Labor will announce details of our policies on paid  maternity leave and to help Australians balance work and family life.

Australians should not be forced to make the choice between a good  parent and a good employee.  They should be able to be both.

Owning your own home

Labor  will  also  release  policies  to  help  make  housing  more   affordable.

In Sydney it has got to the point where people like nurses and police officers  cannot afford their own home.

Labor has already floated ideas like:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Encouraging  superannuation  funds  to  invest  in  affordable   housing for average-income earning families.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And Matched  Savings  Accounts  that  match,  dollar-for-dollar,  the   savings that low income earners make towards saving for a house.

These  policies  are  in  stark  contrast  to  the  options  being  considered  by  the   Howard Government that will turn the banks into both landlord and lender -  making  entry  level  housing  even  less  affordable  for  struggling  Australian   families.

Cutting the tax burden

Finally,  Labor  will  lower  the  tax  burden  on  Australian  families   struggling under financial pressure through targeted tax cuts.

Page 9



With the exception perhaps of those wealthy friends of the Liberal Party with  access to tax minimisation schemes, people are paying too much tax because  of bracket creep.

This year Labor started the debate about the best way to return it to them.

Targeted  properly  -  through  tax  credits  for  example  -  tax  cuts  can  also   address  welfare  to  work  problems  and  the  costs  associated  with  raising  a   family.

They  can  also  deliver  a  real  increase  in  the  disposable  income  of  working   families.

Now  I  have  gone  into  some  detail  in  these  areas  and  directions  but   fundamentally  when  you  think  about  it  what  are  we  talking  about  as  the   things that matter to Australian families?

Their  jobs  and  the  security  associated  with  them  and  the  quality  of  them,   their  ability  to  own  a  home,  their  ability  to  get  decent  health  care  for  their   families,  their  ability  to  know  that  education  is  available  to  them  and  their   children  and  of  course  the  need  for  them  to  ensure  adequacy  for  them  in   retirement.

These values haven’t changed but the responses to them will and that’s why  the policy initiatives we bring forward will hold true to those core aspirations  of  working  Australians  but  will  be  developed  and  responded  to  in   contemporary terms.

And of course the means by which we deliver it is the strong economy, the  diversified, the realisation of our potential, the sustainability of our economic  base.

These  are  the  things  that  I  stand  for.   These  are  the  things  that  will  be   delivered under my leadership.

I will fight for everyone and never give up…

I  want  to  finish  by  letting  you  know  not  just  what  I’ll  do  for  Australia,  and   why, but how I’ll do it.

I’ve been Leader of the Labor Party for just over 12 months now.

In that time I’ve taken on people in my own party to get the best new talent  on my front bench, and won.

Page 10

I fought for and got the most far-reaching reforms to the Labor Party in 30  years despite people on my own side telling me that my Leadership would be  finished if I didn’t back off.

And if I was really timid on asylum seekers, then I tell you what I would have  done - I would have gone along with my critics, taken the easy applause, and  junked all the bits of our asylum seeker policy that anyone objected to.

I would have said ‘yes, scrap mandatory detention’ and ‘throw the doors open  to the country’.

It would have been the easy way out for me.

But it’s not the right policy for the country; it's not what I believe in; and it's  not what most people in this country believe in either.

Whether it’s in my party, or the parliament, I’ll stand up for what I believe is  best for this country.

I’ve  been  doing  it  for  25  years  -  as  ACTU  President  delivering  a  national   superannuation  scheme;  as  Primary  Industries  Minister  delivering  value-adding for our farmers; as Science Minister establishing Cooperative Research  Centres;  and  as  Education  and  Training  Minister  delivering  more  education   and training opportunities for more people.

That's why I want to be Prime Minister - to stand up for the nation’s security  but to also stand up for all those people who have been left behind.

Someone who stands up for the nation’s security and for the nation’s people.

I will fight to return the country to a more tolerant, compassionate and fair  society.  One where we can be proud again of our place in the world and the  region.

That's  what  you'll  get  from  Simon  Crean  if  you  elect  me  Prime  Minister  -   someone who will fight for the best interests of this nation and all its people  every time, no matter how hard it gets.

LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

TRANSCRIPT OF NATIONAL PRESS CLUB QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -  CANBERRA, 10 DECEMBER 2002

E & OE - PROOF ONLY

Subjects:  Leadership;  Working families; Carmen Lawrence;  Tax relief; Iraq; Engagement with the region;  Labor working with business



LAURA TINGLE from The Financial Review, Simon.  You have talked about all  of your attempts to change the Party over the last year, but your speech has  ultimately been, had to be defensive and you [tape break] making references  to Carmen Lawrence’s remarks about being timid. The Party finishes the year  pretty depressed. I wonder, given that you have got an overwhelming  commitment to the Party and the lower-income earners in Australia, whether  there will be some point in the future, where, if you can’t pick up the  momentum that you need, you will assess what’s happening and say, `Do I  need to fall on my sword?’

CREAN:  Well, one out of one, eh? How long does it take to get on  to the interests that matter to the Canberra Press Gallery, and not to the  Australian people? I’ll tell you what - I’ve been going around this country for  the last twelve months in one form or another, and the last thing people ask  me is about the leadership of the Labor Party, Laura. Now, if you think that it  is important, you write about it. But we have to go over the top of you if that  is all you are going to write about. And, quite frankly, I will - because you can  ask it as long as you like, and I’ll repeat it once today, and then I hope you  will be satisfied. I will be leading the Labor Party at the next election. And I  will be leading it on the policy framework and agenda that I have just  outlined. Why? Because the country needs it, and because I am committed to  it.



And I know from the experiences that I have been through in the past, and I  have had to take tough leadership positions in all sorts of times. And I also  might say that, having taken those tough decisions, I’ve been written off by  colleagues plenty of times, including the media. But I have kept bouncing

Page 12

back, because I am determined and because I believe in what I am arguing  for. And I believe that holding the positions of authority gives you a unique  opportunity in this country to actually change the place for the better.

I have always been out there for working people. That is what struggles, and  commitments, and campaigns in the trade union movement have been about.  They have been not bloody-minded. I see people from employer groups here.  I have had very good working relations with them, because I basically believe  that by working cooperatively in these directions you can actually get good  outcomes for both sides. It’s what the Accord was about. Now, we have faced  a lot of hostile criticism in the trade union movement about that, but  delivered it. And there have been important legacies from it.

But, similarly, in relation - take Primary Industries, when people said, `Oh  well, this will be the testing ground.  He’ll never make it there.  Fancy sending  a trade union official out to relate to the farmers.’  They still talk about the  leadership and direction that I gave. And have a look at the drought policy  that was announced yesterday. Have a look at how much of that was put in  place by me, that hasn’t been delivered expeditiously or flexibly enough by  them. And that was me as the Labor Primary Industries Minister - not  because I came, necessarily, from any background in the area, but because I  have an inherent faith in the Australian economy and its ability to perform  better if government policies are supportive and if they push people in the  direction of the reform and the change.

So I’ll be around for a long time to come. I will be around as Leader of the  Labor Party at the next election and, on this policy framework that I have  outlined today, I believe we will win.

DENNIS SHANAHAN of The Australian, Mr Crean.  A number of policies that  you have outlined today - traditional policies directed at working families, the  battlers - are you prepared to fight for them and say to those, as you have  described at the extremes of the right or left, that there is no longer a place

for them in the Labor Party? Are you prepared to say, `I am representing this  majority in the middle’, and if extremists have a different view - whether it is  on asylum seekers or whatever - that you’re prepared to say that this is your  Labor Party and that is what you stand for?

CREAN:  Well, on the first part of the question, absolutely. I will  always fight for the interests of working people, Dennis. As for what you refer  to as ‘the extremists’ and culling them out, my initial instinct is always to try  and include. I am an inclusive person.  I have always practised it and it is  what I drove in the Party reforms. But, that is not to say that what you try  and get is compromise that is unworkable. If, in the end, the call has to be  made that you lead, and take those critics on - and beat them or isolate  them, or whatever technique is used - I’ll do it.  I’ll stand up for what is right.   And I will continue to do that for as long as I am around.

Page 13

MICHAEL HARVEY from the Herald Sun, Mr Crean.  After Dr Lawrence’s press  conference last week, there was criticism that it was a bad look for you, that  there was a measure of applause after her comments. Have you spoken to  anyone about that, disciplined or cautioned anyone? And can I also ask - you  mentioned about bracket creep and targeted tax relief - will you or would the  Labor Government consider indexing the tax scales to inflation?

CREAN:  The answer to the last part of the question is no, we won’t  be indexing. Those who want to argue it, of course they can argue it, but I  don’t support the straight indexation. I think that we have got to look at the  impact and where it is hurting, and redistribute.  I mean, the big problem  with the tax scales, of course, is that the tax cuts that came out of the GST  were heavily weighted, unfairly. I think the statistic was that some 50% of  the tax cuts went to the top 20% - it might have been 80%, I can’t remember  - but anyway, a very high proportion went to, the biggest tax cuts went to the  top end. I think that we have got to use income tax policy and the impact of  bracket creep to get fairness back into the system.

As for the first part of your question, yes I have had discussions with a  number of people, and they with me, to clarify the position. I think that one  needs to understand the circumstances of Carmen’s resignation. It was a very  personal thing for her.  She has supporters and friends within the Party and  people were there as friends, not supporters of her comments. And I think  that needs to be respected, and indeed, appreciated.

We go through all sorts of tough times in this job but, in the end, you do rely  on your friends -  your family and your friends. That is terribly important.   And if having made one tough decision - and it was tough for her, but it was  the only one that she could make - they were there to support her. All of  them that I have spoken to indicated to me they had no idea as to what she  was going to say at the Press Conference, and that they don’t support what  she had to say in relation to the Party.

STEVE LEWIS:  I’ll just ask you, Simon, on the issue of tax relief. You have  talked about both bracket creep and tax credits.  Do you have - if you had to  choose one or the other, what would be the priority for you going through to  the next election? And are you making a commitment that you will be offering  tax relief before the next election or going into the next election?

CREAN:  Whether you call them tax credits or tax cuts, they are the  same thing. If you are giving tax credits, that is lessening the tax burden. It’s  a benefit to the individual. Now, the trouble is that there is a complexity  associated with tax credits, but there are significant benefits in terms of  welfare to work and also addressing the needs of families.  So I think that the  exercise here is to look at what the options are in all of those areas.  I think  that we should consider the tax credits argument but, in the end, what are  we talking about? We are talking about tax cuts for middle- and low-income  families as the priority.

Page 14



STEVE LEWIS: And is that a commitment that you will be offering tax  relief for the next election?  Or is it something that, if the budget can’t afford  it, it’ll put on the backburner?

CREAN:  Look, I always keep getting asked this question about,  ‘How can you say that you are going to look at these things, and still look to  the budget?’  For all of those who asked those questions in the lead-up to the  last election, look at the program we took to the last election.  All of it costed,  all of it funded, and none of it which would have taken the budget into deficit.  Now look at them, on the other hand, who said that they would never  produce a deficit - and did.  To be lecturing us about these sorts of things, I  think, is inappropriate from them.  I think that they are legitimate questions,  but I think, quite frankly, until we know what the true state of the budget is,  until we have had our costings, until we have gone through the channels, I  think you have got to take us on our track record. And our track record in  terms of what we promised last time, what we promised the time before,  achieved the objectives, achieved the direction of the change - we will do it  again and we will do it in a fiscally responsible way.

DENNIS ATKINS from the Courier Mail, Mr Crean.  Do you believe that Iraq  has weapons of mass destruction at the moment and, if you do, and Iraq’s  12,000-page document dumped at the UN asserts otherwise, would that  constitute a material breach which would possibly trigger war?

CREAN:  No, the document asserting that from Iraq does not, in my  view, constitute a material breach. And interestingly, I don’t even see the  Prime Minister or the President of the United States arguing that point. Now, I  think that the document - if you asked me, ‘Do they have weapons of mass  destruction?’ - I believe they do, I believe they have had.  And if, in fact, they  have disarmed and complied with the United Nations directive to do that,  then that is something for the weapons inspectors to be making a judgement  about, taking account of what they observe, what they report back, as well as  the document that has been initiated.

But I do say this - because I think that it is terribly important - I noticed that  the Prime Minister today was asked about this document and asked to  comment about it. And he said something like, `Until I know what others,  what the Americans have had to say about it, I’m not going to be speaking  for Australia.’ Well that is just totally inappropriate.  I mean, quite frankly, we  have got to make our own independent assessment of the evidence.  And we  have got to stand up for what is in Australia’s interests and speak out for  what is in Australia’s interests - not just wait for someone else to do it for us.  And I think this is the real difficulty that we have been facing in this Iraq  situation.

Labor believes in the importance of the United Nations and the enforcement  of the international rule of law.  We have always done it consistently; through

Page 15

our history we have done it.  John Howard wants to opt in and out.  He wants  to bag the UN one minute and then jump onboard when the going gets tough  at home or, if there is all sorts of pressure from other countries, to get in and  comply with the UN.

We in the Labor Party have been absolutely consistent from the day we  released our policy position on Iraq, of saying it has to go through the United  Nations. Now, there is a process in place.  The Iraqis’ reporting was an  important part of the timetable for that process. They complied with it. There  is now another timeframe, a 60-day timeframe for the weapons inspectors to  consider the position and report to the United Nations. That mechanism has  to be persisted with. But, in the meantime, Australia should be making its  own independent assessment of what Iraq is saying, and preparing ourselves  for a judgement we have to take in our interests, not just following what  someone else says.

LOUISE DODSON, The Age, Mr Crean.  You talked about comprehensive  engagement, that Labor will stand for comprehensive engagement with the  region.  Are you talking about, are you just sort of talking rhetoric or are you  talking about, sort of, deeper security agreements with countries like  Indonesia, like say, the Keating Government entered into?

CREAN:  Well, I am talking about deeper arrangements. I believe  that we have to engage with our region, Louise. If anyone didn’t think so  before, then they should accept that for the purposes of the recent threat,  the War on Terror, the Bali Bombing, it is absolutely essential that we engage  with Indonesia. I was arguing at the beginning of the year that we needed to  engage with Indonesia to stop the people-smugglers. I was arguing very  much at the beginning that we had to have a better engagement,  understanding, pressure on them to tighten up their laws so that there were  penalties against the people-smugglers, and getting better cooperation and  working with the police.

Interestingly enough, that is what the Government has done, and it has been  the fundamental reason why no boats have come down. The Government  would like you to believe it was the ‘Pacific Solution’, but they actually have  worked much more closely with the Indonesians. We believe we can do it  even better - not only believe that we can do it better, we will work harder at  developing it.

As for the region itself, though, it is vital that what we do is to engage our  region. And this was not just, as you say, rhetoric.  I said this in a speech in  April and then visited China off the back of it.  I went to China and said, ‘Old  friends, new partners’. We have had a thirty-year association where the call  by the Whitlam Government in recognising China - some thirty years ago -  has paid huge dividends to us in terms of their respect for us. There is a  goodwill there.

Page 16

But what has happened in recent times is that they have become a member  of the World Trade Organisation.  They also happened to be a huge and  growing market. They happen to be a country that, if we work cooperatively  with them on the trade agenda, I also believe that we can do much better in  developing peace and security in the region.

This is where I argue that us having that association, plus the strength of our  alliance with the United States, can make us an important facilitator in  addressing those larger peace and security issues. We shouldn’t shirk from it.  We shouldn’t just see it in terms of what is in it in a bilateral sense. We  should see our ability, again, to use the re-engagement of the region to  actually shape it, to actually be taken seriously in dialogue and discussion  about the broad range of trade, peace and security issues. That is why I  argued for it. I have seen it in operation under previous Labor Governments.  It has not been happening, as it should have been, under this Government.  We have got to re-engage again.

FRAN KELLY from The 7.30 Report, Mr Crean.  You say that the last thing  people ask you about as you’re out and about is the Labor leadership, and  that you want to reclaim your Party for most Australians.  But the polls show  that your personal popularity as preferred Prime Minister stakes is stuck very  low.  Does that mean that, whatever you are telling people, they are either  not listening to it or they’re not liking what they are hearing? How do you  explain that?  Is it just the times?  Or do you have a new plan for how to  connect?

CREAN:  How do I explain it? I explain it by mentioning Steve  Bracks, Mike Rann, Bob Carr, Peter Beattie, Geoff Gallop, Claire Martin - all of  the Labor Premiers and Leaders were well behind their opponents in the  preferred Premier stakes.  John Howard was well behind Paul Keating in  1993.  I wouldn’t have thought I had to explain that to you, Fran. I would  have thought that you, as an observer of politics in this country, would know  that.

You want to get preoccupied with the polls.  Well, have a look at them in  recent times. I mean, whatever you might perceive to be the difficulty  confronting us, and the dominance of Howard - that’s not what the polls  show in terms of Parties. And so, I say to you that I am not fussed one way  or the other, and I won’t be deterred from my task of sticking to the agenda  and the framework and the timetable that I set for myself.

I knew the first year was going to be hard, because we had to face up to  hard decisions - decisions we hadn’t taken in the past, and we should have.   I’m prepared to take them on but, as always with a term, unless you take  those hard decisions early in the term you never get around to them.

Now, I believe that it will lay the base for important decisions that we take,  because there has been an inclusion, an openness within the Party structures

Page 17

about these difficult decisions.  We’ve had the conferences - a very  democratic exercise.  That’s how I want to operate in terms of the policy  developments.  We will be going to the next phase, but you’ve already seen  important differentiation this year on policy issues, which I’ve outlined.  The  leadership race and Opposition is a marathon, not a sprint.  I’ve said that  before, but I firmly believe it.  And, so, I’ll be leading the Party.  I’ll be leading  it in the direction and the style that I’ve demonstrated so far and it will, in  terms of the policy debate, connect, because these are the issues that matter  to ordinary Australians.  They’re the things they want answers to.  Sure, they  want us to be engaged and involved and addressing the issues of national  security, but that’s why we’ve been out in front on a number of those areas  too.  So, we can do both - address the national security issues, but address  the domestic security ones as well.  That’s what people are looking for, and  that’s what they’ll get from me.

MICHELLE GRATTAN, The Age.  Mr Crean, you’ve spoken about working  cooperatively with business organisations and yet, when he was here  recently, Mark Latham delivered a ‘very tough on business’ message.  Would  business find a Labor Government more difficult, or much more difficult, to  deal with than dealing with this Government?  And, secondly, after a few days  reflecting on the matter, do you renew your call to John Howard to apologise  to Asian Governments for his pre-emptive strike remarks?

CREAN: Well, on the latter question first, Michelle, I think the fact that  Alexander Downer has been sent out to clean up the Prime Minister’s remarks  is evidence that there’s recognition on their part that they have caused  damage.  I would have though that leadership was about doing that yourself.   I would have thought, more so, in the case of worrying what delegating it to  Alexander might result in.  But I said at the time that it was important for the  Prime Minister to correct the record.  The Government has moved to correct  the record.  I think it’s lack of leadership that he didn’t do it.

Mark Latham is here today, again, Michelle.  And, of course, he - I can’t  remember specifically the words that he used.  But, you know, this is a  question in my mind of working constructively with these organisations, but  not rolling over to them.  And whether that’s business, or the Labor Party, or  the trade unions - that’s how I will operate.  I’m not going to be beholden to  any particular interest group, but I have a firm conviction that the future of  this country does depend very much on trying to bring people with you, work  with organisations that can actually make a difference in this country - and  particularly with business, because it’s fundamental to our wealth creation.   It’s something I’ve always practised, but never rolled over to.  I’ve had some  of the biggest blues - some even bigger than I’ve had in the Labor Party -  with employers.  I remember having one with Alan Jones way back in the  early 1980s about minimum wage rates - and won - but, you know, I think it  is important to work with them and not kowtow to them.  And the further  point I make is, what will their relationship be with us?  They had a good  relationship with us in the past, and I was part of building that relationship.  I

Page 18

expect the relationship to be a good one in the future, but it has to be part of  getting on board with this agenda of maximising our potential, because that’s  where our ability to deliver the fairness, the outcomes, the results, the  agendas that I’ve talked about before, that’s where it derives from.

MARK RILEY, Mr Crean, from the Sydney Morning Herald.  Can I take you  back to the issue of Iraq?  The Prime Minister recently said that he will have a  parliamentary debate if the question comes around on whether Australia  should be part of an action in Iraq, but he’s also said that it will be ultimately  an executive decision - in other words, the Parliament can have its say, but  the executive may ignore it.  That presents a rather difficult political question  for you.  Are you prepared, as a Leader of an Opposition, to be the Leader  who let Australian troops go into the theatre of war and, possibly, to die  without the bipartisan support of the Parliament?

CREAN: The question of the Prime Minister’s agreement to the  parliamentary debate only happened when we called for it.  That was not his  instinct.  He was prepared, as was demonstrated, to go along with talking up  the war rhetoric, and accused those who were arguing for peace as  appeasers.  And what changed him?  Public opinion changed him, as it did the  President of the US, in terms of going to the United Nations.  The other thing  that changed him, interestingly enough - and I was there on the very same  day - was that the RSL came out and argued against his position.

So I think this is a Prime Minister whose instinct hasn’t been good in relation  to this issue and that’s why he’s not only got to have the Parliament debate  the issue, he’s got to take the Australian people with him.  And I think his  statement today is not going to give great confidence in that regard, where  he says something like, ‘I’m not going to tell the Australian people what my  views are about the Iraqi document until I’ve spoken to the Americans’.  This  is just reinforcement of the view that he doesn’t lead and that our position is  going to be determined by others, and others’ interests, not our national  interests.  And that’s why I argue very strongly that the Parliament itself  needs to be involved.  Of course, executives have to make decisions, but they  can’t make them in isolation - otherwise they run into serious problems.

And they might think that they can keep pushing the agenda on their terms,  in a narrowness of their thinking, in a narrowness of advice - but, unless they  take the advice more widely, and I’m saying on this occasion that if indeed  the Government is genuine about getting bipartisan support, it can’t take that  decision unless it’s prepared to talk with us in advance of it.  It’s not to say  we have to be involved in that decision, but it would be a stupid Government  not to involve the Opposition.

The Government has been prepared to involve us up to a point, and it should  involve us more.  And indeed in terms of the War on Terrorism, when it did  involve us it found constructive input on the anti-terrorism legislation, which  the Prime Minister himself, in this Press Club, described as having got the

Page 19

Page 20

right balance.  He should do the same in terms of the ASIO bills.  And so the  question of where it goes from here and how the Australian people are taken,  depends fundamentally on a preparedness on the part of the Prime Minister  of this country to stand up for what’s in Australia’s interests and to be a  leader in that regard, not a follower.



CATHERINE MCGRATH from ABC Radio Current Affairs.  Can I follow up that  question, because I want you to clarify - can you envisage an Opposition not  supporting a US military strike?  Would there be circumstances where you  would say, ‘no, we’re not supporting it’.

CREAN: Of course I can envisage that.  Of course I can and we’ve said,  on the evidence available today, to this date, there is no case for unilateral  action by the United States.  We’ve been saying that since April.

Now, what I then go on to say to you is, that you always talk in terms of  trying to anticipate what our response will be if there’s a war.  I say to you,  we’ve got to assert the discipline and the direction and the strength of our  position to influence the peace.  And I say that we can have stronger  influence in there with the United States and the other countries in the  Security Council, using our relationship with the United States to argue for the  peace.  That’s what I’m saying, and that’s what would be happening if I was  Prime Minister.  I wouldn’t be talking up the rhetoric of war, as the Prime  Minister has done.  I wouldn’t be being provocative in the region in terms of  the new doctrine of pre-emptive.  I do not think that’s in Australia’s national  interests. Of course, you’ve got to defend the nation, but what’s the best way  to defend it?  To secure the base for peace and security in the region - and  you don’t do that by talking up the war.



There’s a mechanism to deal with the Iraqi situation, a mechanism that so far  is going in the right direction.  All efforts have to be put in the direction of  securing that, and that’s what I’ll be arguing for and would be advocating  more strongly than the current Prime Minister.
