THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO

E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TV INTERVIEW   SKY NEWS  THURSDAY, 12 FEBRUARY 2015

SUBJECT/S:  Human  Rights  Commission  Report  into  Children  in  Detention;   Liberal hypocrisy.

DAVID LIPSON: The Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles joins me now,  thanks for your time.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks David.

LIPSON: Three hundred and thirty children in indefinite detention now, should they be  released?

MARLES: Well what I take as the critical element from the Human Rights Commission’s  report is that we do need to be doing everything humanly practicably to get these kids  out of detention as quickly as possible. This makes really difficult reading and I think any  fair minded person looking at what has been uncovered in this report, what has been,  and the findings in it, can’t help but feel a great degree of discomfort about the  experience that kids are having in detention and the report expert advice, plain common

sense tells you we need to be doing everything we can, as quickly as we can to get kids  out of detention.

LIPSON: So, specifically what should be done to get them out of detention what, how  should they be cared for and where should they be taken?

MARLES: Well there are a whole lot of opportunities and possibilities in terms of how  you deal with children and their families prior to people getting a refugee status  determination. Of course the most important step you take is processing people as  quickly as possible and what Professor Triggs is referring to there about the fact that  time limits have blown out under this Government is a reflection on the fact that through

most of 2014 the Government basically shut up shop in terms of processing people in  an act of petulance because they couldn’t get their temporary protection visa regulation  through the Senate. So the most important thing you can do is process people but there  is community detention as an administrative arrangement which would get kids out of  detention facilities, it’s that kind of thing that we need to look at and I think, you know,  we are keen to go through this report in all its detail, come up with a methodical  response to it, to see how we, how the government can do things better because we as  a country need to.



LIPSON: The report is critical of the policies implemented under Kevin Rudd in July  2013 which meant that anyone who arrives by boat would never be settled in Australia,  that was Labor’s line and it’s been continued by the Coalition. The report says “the  suspension of processing has had a profound impact on the time that people have  waited to have their refugee claims assessed. It’s also prolonged the detention of  children in on-shore and off-shore facilities.” Was that policy that Labor implemented a  mistake?

MARLES: Well I don’t think it was a mistake to put in place the Regional Resettlement  Arrangement because what that has done more than any other act of an Australian  Government is see an end of the flow of asylum seeker vessels coming from Indonesia  and as a result saving lives at sea. A difficult decision but one which was necessarily to  bring about an end to the loss of life at sea -

LIPSON: But now you’re suggesting that children should be released?

MARLES: Well I make this point, in the report itself it makes the point that if children are  to be processed offshore then they need to be done so in a way where their human  rights are respected, that needs to occur and I think we should be hearing from the  minister about the ways in which that can be done on Nauru now without children being  in detention. I’d like to hear from the minister about what’s possible there, but the  reference to suspension of processing here, that’s as much about what occurred under  this government through the course of 2014 but can I -



LIPSON: Sure that’s true but do you take responsibility for Labor’s part in putting in  place this policy in the first place?

MARLES: Well as I say I make the point that the decision that we took under the  Regional Resettlement Arrangement was critical in terms of stopping the flow of asylum  seekers vessels but I would make this point -

LIPSON: If it was critical then though, isn’t it still critical now?

MARLES: Of course…

LIPSON: What’s changed?

MARLES: Nothing has changed it is absolutely critical that offshore processing remains  in place because it more than anything else has been responsible for seeing an end to  the flow of asylum seeker vessels. That said, both Nauru and Manus ought to be

providing humane and safe refuge to people and I am not sure about whether or not  that is occurring and in that sense I think we would be doing different things differently if  we were in Government, but I want to make this point David, all those questions you  have asked me are completely fair and it indicates that it is difficult reading for both  sides of politics. For the Prime Minister today to go out and to suggest that this is a  blatantly partisan political exercise is outrageous, it obviously isn’t. This is a case of  shooting the messenger when you don’t like the message and in the process what  they’ve done is essentially besmirch the character of Professor Triggs, who is an  eminent Australian and frankly when you have a look at this, this is the kind of  desperation on the part of the Prime Minister which has characterised this week in  Parliament.

LIPSON: Was it naÃÂ¯ve of the commission in any way to not look at those years under  Labor because under Labor there were almost 2000 children in detention now there is  just over 300?



MARLES: If you look at the report I think it looks at the way in which children have been  kept in detention over a long period of time, now Professor Triggs made the point today  that her concern was the blowout in the time that people, that children were spending in

detention which has occurred under this Government and since 2010 under the former  Labor Government we were working very hard to get children out of detention as quickly  as possible, doesn’t mean everything was perfect but that is what we were seeking to  do, but the times in detention they have blown out under this Government and that’s the  point that Professor Triggs made today, but look across both sides of the aisle - all of  surely when you read the appalling findings in this report need to be working together to  try and get kids out of detention as quickly as possible and what you see from the  Government is nothing but a blatant attempt to shoot the messenger so as to detract  attention from the content of this report.

LIPSON: Okay on another issue the AFP arrested two men with a knife, a machete and  an Islamic State flag and it was said they were planning a public beheading and one of  them came to Australia as an asylum seeker under Labor’s watch and that was pointed  out by the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, what is your response to that?

MARLES: I think the Minister needs to be very careful, very careful indeed about  walking down this path. I mean I understand he is new in the job and I understand he is  desperate to the fill the shoes of his predecessor but David this is a very dangerous  path for him to walk down. What is very clear is this, there was no warnings in respect of  these individuals at the time they came to Australia, that has been made clear by the  authorities and if you want to open this door the Government needs to have a very good  look at what happened with Khaleed Sharrouf who was on a ‘no fly’ list, so he was on a  warning list - a ‘no fly’ list and under the former Minister was allowed to leave this  country and go to Syria and Iraq. Man Monis - if you want to walk down this path

entered Australia under the Howard Government. This is grubby desperation of the  worst kind and trying to politicise what is a deeply serious issue for the Australian  people is a disgrace.

LIPSON: Richard Marles we will have to leave it there.
