STATEMENT REGARDING KOSOVO

Â

The Government is today announcing that it has determined to accept 
4,000 Kosovo Albanians for temporary stay in Australia .

Â

This short-term humanitarian measure will assist in 
alleviating the massive suffering and human tragedy that has developed 
in the former Republic of Yugoslavia.

Â

Australia will join with other countries that have 
announced they will assist in this manner.

Â

The measure will complement the existing humanitarian 
and refugee program which will remain available to all applicants from 
the region.

Â

The 4,000 displaced persons will be given an initial 
three-month visa which will be extended if or as circumstances require. 
They will be provided with food, accommodation, necessitates of life 
and health care.

Â

These individuals will be housed in temporary accommodation, 
possibly in defence installations. These installations may well be in 
remote areas of Australia.

Â

Special legislation will be passed to give effect 
to this short-term humanitarian assistance package. The legislation 
will not permit these people to apply for any other form of visa, including 
protection visas, while in Australia. I propose that this legislation 
will be effective from today. An indication of Opposition support has 
been received.

Â

The Australian Government will be calling upon community 
organisations to assist in this humanitarian endeavour.

Â

I will be establishing a task force immediately to 
coordinate the many logistical and other arrangements necessary to give 
effect to this decision.
