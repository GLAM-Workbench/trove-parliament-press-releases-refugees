ANTHONY ALBANESE

FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORT MINISTER  LEADER OF THE HOUSE





INTERVIEW WITH MARK PARTON

2CC BREAKFAST

9 JULY 2012



E & O E - PROOF ONLY



Issues: Greens preferences, carbon price, Canberra Airport



MARK PARTON:                      Anthony Albanese is the Minister for Transport and he joins this  program from time to time, and we're pleased to say he's on the line right now.  G'day Anthony.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:        G'day Mark, how are you?



MARK PARTON:                      Not bad.  It's taken you blokes a while to work out that the Greens are  extremists hasn't it?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Look, I've been engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the electorate of  Grayndler in the inner west with the Greens for some time.  I think it's important to draw a  distinction between Greens supporters and the Greens Party. Many of the Greens' supporters  support them for all sorts of reasons. While many in the Greens Party are genuine environmentalists,  many others have a very ideological view of the world that is very different from a Labor view of the  world.



MARK PARTON:                      Now, there's been fighting words from the Prime Minister on this issue  in the past.  There's certainly been very, very strong words in the last couple of days from the likes of  Sam Dastyari and Paul Howes and others.  Does this signal the end of this marriage?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Well, there has never been a marriage so there can't be a divorce.  You  deal with the Parliament that you've got.



John Howard had to deal with the Democrats for many years when they had the balance of power in  the Senate.  That's a fact of life.  We live in a proportional system and you've got to deal with people  who aren't in your own party.



Unfortunately, what we saw in the Parliament over the asylum-seeker issue is both the Coalition and  the Greens were not serious about trying to negotiate through a solution.



MARK PARTON:                      I just had a comment put up on my screen that I've got to share with  you.  It's been suggested to me, if it wasn't a marriage or a de facto, maybe it was a civil union.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Well, perhaps.



MARK PARTON:                      Sarah Hanson-Young was interviewed on ABC TV in the last 10 minutes  or so, and she said that she thought young Greens voters - I don't know why in particular she's gone  with Greens voters.  But young Greens voters would be confused by the Labor Party preferencing  the Coalition ahead of the Greens.  That's what Sarah Hanson-Young said.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Well, no-one has said that we'll do that.  All that people are saying is that  there shouldn't be an automatic preference of the Greens Party, and that has always been the case.



We negotiate with different political parties about preference arrangements.  In the New South  Wales election, the Greens Party chose to not preference Labor in a range of seats and that cost  Labor those seats.



Political parties will negotiate preference arrangements on a case-by-case basis. In Grayndler, I've  tended to preference the Greens.



But, importantly, it's the Coalition who are responsible for the Greens' political party being in the  House of Representatives.  They gave the Greens preferences in the electorate of Melbourne.  They  ensured that Adam Bandt got elected.



They preferenced the Greens before myself and the Greens finished ahead of the Liberals in my seat.   So, they were trying to get a Green elected rather than myself in the House of Representatives.



MARK PARTON:                      Let's talk about Tony Abbott who, of course, has been on an endless trail  - endless campaign trail against the carbon tax.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Well, now he's going overseas for a couple of weeks, I see.  The cue's been  put in the rack.



MARK PARTON:                      Well, I don't know if that's really fair.  I mean, leaders go overseas from  time to time.  Yours has just returned.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       I’ve got no problem with that at all, except that Tony Abbott said that he  wouldn't.  He said he was going to be campaigning day in and day out, nothing else, and he's  dropped off already.



MARK PARTON:                      It was pointed out on the Insiders program yesterday, I think, by David  Marr that Tony Abbott's speaking on behalf of a lot of businesses regarding the carbon tax.  But  interestingly, without him there, they're not moaning much about it.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Well, that's exactly right, because they know the reality is very different  from the scare campaign.  The reality is that the inflationary effect of the carbon price is 0.7 per cent  or 70 cents in every $100 compared with the change that occurred with the GST which, of course,  was $10 in every $100.



This is a very minor change that's occurred.  He's gone into businesses and talked them down,  especially in the area of transport.



Tony Abbott was out there at Brindabella Airlines near Canberra talking about how the carbon price  was stopping routes being flown.  But, when you looked at Brindabella's own statements, what they  were doing was using some aircraft for fly in-fly out jobs because they could make more money out  of it and that’s fair enough.



MARK PARTON:                      The other thing I've got to talk to you about this morning is Bob Winnel  from the Village Building Company has been having a go at you on the Village website over the last  couple of days.  He's attacked the Federal and New South Wales governments over their handling of  Tralee's planning assessment and, basically, what he's saying is that there was a bias towards the  Canberra Airport.  They're pursuing the fact that there was too much weight put on these  documents that he hasn't seen, because I think they're - he says they're being hidden from the  airport.  How do you respond to those?



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       They have a vested interest and vested interests will always speak in a  particular way.  I have no vested interest in either the Village Building Company or the owners of  Canberra Airport.



What I do say though, as the federal Aviation Minister, like my predecessors, like my department has  over a long period of time, is that commonsense tells you that you don't build residential houses  directly under flight paths, particularly where you have a greenfield site.



Commonsense tells you that site should be used for other purposes - for industrial purposes.  My  view isn't that people shouldn't be able to make money out of land ownership under flight paths,  but where you have a flight path that doesn't have housing under it, then it’s unusual to argue we  shouldn't learn the lessons of the past.



Where I am here in Sydney, you can't do anything about that.  There are houses under the flight  paths, including mine.  You might have just heard a plane over the top of my house just then.  For  me, none of this is personal, it just makes common sense.  Every time there's been an independent  assessment of this, the outcome has been exactly the same.



MARK PARTON:                      Albo, thanks for your time this morning and good luck.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Good to talk to you, mate.



MARK PARTON:                      Good luck in that hand-to-hand combat with the Greens.



ANTHONY ALBANESE:       Thanks very much.



MARK PARTON:                      Minister for Transport, Anthony Albanese.
