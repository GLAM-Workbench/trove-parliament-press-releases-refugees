LAUNCHING OF "HELP POLAND LIVE" APPEAL  MELBOURNE

We are here today to extend the helping hand of the people oÂ£  -Australia to the people of Poland in thejtor~hour of-need. The causes of that need are complex. They have their roots in  the economics and politics of post-war Poland. But whatever

the causes may b e # the situation in Poland today is that the  essentials of life are in desperately short supply. ____

At a time when the northern winter is about to begin, many of  the most basic human needs for food, medicines and clothing }< simply cannot b o  met __ Old people and children are p articularly '. at risk. So the appeal that is being launched here today to  ."Help Poland Live" strikes a chord at the very heart of our 1

concern for people.

This appeal is not the beginning of the'Australian community's----attempts to help the people of Poland. Right from the beginning  of the present" crisis, Polish Australians have been sending an  ever increasing volume of assistance. In the last twelve months

a Iona, over $ 5 "null ion wor th of aid has. beert— sent.— Much of this  support has taken the form of food parcels and money sent to  friends and family.

For Polish Australians, the suffering is not something affecting  .distantÂ· strangers. It is about close family and friends; it xs ~  happening in places they know intimately; it reaches them  through letters and phone calls, and through conversations

with- recently arrived refugees.

Poland h a s .not had an easy or peaceful history. Repeatedly over  the past two Centuries, Poland has come under pressure from  powex'f ul neighbours to the West and to the East. The Polish  people have had to struggle for their x’ight— te-exist—as an

independent state. Through all the years of their history, the  courage of the Polish people has been remarkable by  any standards.

The~political implication^ of the present crisis in Poland are  known to everyone here. In the past year the Australian Government  has consistently called for Poland to be left free to solve its  difficulties in its own way. This call has been widely echoed

i n t e r n a t i o n a l l y a n d  1 want to take this opportunity to recall  what 41 Commonwealth leaders had to say in itelbQume^last month.

Polish Appeal

-  2

The Communique from the meeting reatfeas follows; "Beads of  Government discussed the situation in Poland. They were  concerned that it could have serious implications for the  — international community as-a-whole. They considered that the  people of Poland should be left to determine their own destiny  free from foreign interference.1 1

Poland needs time to sort out its problems so that i t can once  again stand on its own feet economically - and interna11onal aid  is required to give it that breathing space.

Many countries, including the United States, Canada and those in  the European Economic Community, have~already given Government  and non-Government assistance, and the Australian Government is  guaranteeing commercial trade credits to Poland. We need to be  perfectly clear, however, that what community aid to Poland is

all about, what this appeal is all about, is the basic welfare  of millions of ordinary people who are facing the threat of  extreme hardship.

X- have no...dDubt that this appeal will—shew that Australians are not  indifferent to the fate of people in Poland, just as earlier  appeals have shewn that Australians will contribute magnificently  to help alleviate suffering in other parts of the world. The  Government also will not be inactive and I shall announce at the  end of this speech "the contribution that the Government is  prepared to make.

The Federal Council of polish Organisations in Australia is mounting  ~this appeal to collect money for the purchase of food, medicines —   and other essential supplies. These goods will be forwarded  1C to Poland for distribution by the Catholic Church and Solidarity,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  the independent trade union movement, and the Government will also make  available any—necessary assistance from— the Australian Embassy  in Warsaw. The goods will go to the people most in need.

The appeal is being conducted by the Australian National Committee  for Relief to Poland under the eh airman eh ip of Mr. Frank Galbally. .The membership of this committee is drawn from different political .  Ã¢ÂÂ¢   persuasions, religious commitments and walks of life. The appeal

is, in the full meaning of the word, national. 1 am honoured to  have been invited to be its patron. Volunteers are coming forward  in all States! A  number of them are hero-today. — Already a head  office in Melbourne is being run by volunteers, with premises and

support services provided by the generosity of one of the  national Committee members. We. are grateful for your time and .   energy. Thanks to you, the volunteers, the administrative costa _ will b e  kept to a bare minimum.

The funds raised will be used for the maximum possible benefit of the Polish people._Australia's links with Poland go back a century and a half, and a common concern with freedom is a  recurring theme in that history. In both the 19th and 20th Century  Australia has offered a refuge for Poles fleeing oppression in

their native land. In the 1860s and during the two World Wars  Australians organised relief funds to help~in?!and while she fought  fox* her liberty. In the Second World war,our soldiers fought  tyranny side by side on the battlefield of Tobruk. How appropriate

it is that the pioneer explorer Streelecki named our highest  peak after the great Polish fighter for freedom, Kosciuszko, _____
