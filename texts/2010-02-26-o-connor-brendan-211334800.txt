BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

(26 February 2010) Border Protection Command overnight successfully intercepted a  suspected irregular entry vessel.

HMAS Wollongong, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, intercepted  the vessel at 10:20pm (AEDST) 25 February 2010 five nautical miles west of Christmas  Island.

Initial indications suggest 45 passengers and two crew are on board the vessel.

Australia is proactively working with our neighbours, through bilateral cooperation and the  Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime,  to address this most serious issue.

People smuggling is a global and regional problem. According to the UNHCR 2008 Global  Trends report, there were 42 million forcibly displaced persons worldwide at the end of 2008,  including 15.2 million refugees.

The Australian Government has committed more than $654 million to implementing a  comprehensive people smuggling strategy to combat this issue. The Government has  expanded its presence in the region with the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and  the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service recently setting up or expanding  liaison posts devoted to deterring irregular migration.

Agencies are working closely with their counterparts in country exchanging and gathering  information, and strengthening our regional capacity to mitigate irregular migration to  Australia. Our strengthened offshore approach is working. Since September 2008 there have  been 97 disruptions of people smuggling ventures in Indonesia, and the arrest of 43 people  smuggling organisers.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity  and health checks as well as establish their reasons for travel.
