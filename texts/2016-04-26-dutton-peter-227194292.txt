PNG SUPREME COURT JUDGEMENT

This is a decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea.

Australia was not a party to the legal proceedings.

It does not alter Australia’s border protection policies - they remain unchanged.

No one who attempts to travel to Australia illegally by boat will settle in Australia.

The Government will not allow a return to the chaos of the years of the Rudd-Gillard  Labor Governments when regional processing was initiated to deal with the  overwhelming illegal arrivals of more than 50,000 people.

The agreement with Papua New Guinea to establish the Manus Island RPC was  negotiated by the Labor Government.

Those in the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre found to be refugees are able to  resettle in Papua New Guinea.

Those found not to be refugees should return to their country of origin.

People who have attempted to come illegally by boat and are now in the Manus facility  will not be settled in Australia.
