THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER



CHANNEL 7 SUNRISE  BIG GUNS OF POLITICS  16 MARCH 2012



E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Let’s bring in our Big Guns of Politics, Environment Minister Tony Burke and Shadow  Treasurer Joe Hockey. Good morning to both of you. Tony, Kochie just said here that  bullying is twice as bad as it was three years ago, that is astonishing. Obviously the policies  that are coming in - that the government is bringing in - are wonderful, but are you doing  enough? Are they being implemented?

TONY BURKE:

Look, I don’t think you can ever say on something like this that you draw the line and say  you are now doing enough. There is no doubt that the pressure and public awareness, in large  part programs like this, that really started to push the issue, is part of what has led us to go as  far as we have. But it is not just a matter of doing something about it, it is also identifying  when it occurs. I find, as a parent, you don't want to be the parent who wraps your kids up in  cotton wool. You are constantly trying to make the judgement, is it just a hard day at school  or is something worse going on? One of the things I like about the new web site, is that it is  not just for kids who feel they are being bullied, there is a link there for parents as well,  where you can go through and just try to get a sense of the signs as to whether what you are  dealing with and the stories that are coming home to you is something you really do need to  act on.

PRESENTER:

And if you’re the parent of a bully, not sort of ignoring that issue as well. Joe, what are your  thoughts on it?

JOE HOCKEY:

I couldn’t agree more, and good on you for doing it, and its good that the government is  doing it. Tony Abbott announced a task force at the beginning of the year, headed up by Paul

Fletcher, who is a former Optus executive and a Member of Parliament with a focus on cyber  bullying. And I think that is a big area of activity, through Facebook and Twitter, but I  suppose the bottom line is, we got to be nice to each other. We are guilty of that in  Parliament. I plead guilty to that sometimes, getting carried away in Parliament. I think we  have got to be nice to each other as a role model for our children. Just to illustrate the fact  when you are rude to each other or when you are trying to intimidate each other, then that is  not the role models we should be.

PRESENTER:

Nicely said.  I completely agree.

TONY BURKE:

I sort of - growing up and going through high school at a boys’ school - you sort of think of  bullying as physically pushing people around and things like that but it can go so much  deeper in the way people are spoken to, the way people are gossiped about.

PRESENTER:

And the cyber issue, that’s where you can’t shut it off. Now I want to ask you guys, a  Coalition proposal to tow asylum seeker boats back to Indonesia has drawn a bit of criticism  from the country’s Foreign Minister. Now during a visit to Canberra the Minister warned it

was just basically shifting the burden. Joe, does the Coalition stand by the plan?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely, Mel, we do. Absolutely. And why? Because if they are coming from Indonesia  and they are in international waters and it's safe to do so, we will turn them around and send  them back to Indonesia.

PRESENTER:

But the Indonesians are saying “Well we are not going to take them”. Will you just leave  them floating around?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, they will have some obligation to take them. They have come from Indonesia.

PRESENTER:

They have said no.

JOE HOCKEY:

This is where you have the semblance of a standoff. The bottom line is they are coming out  of Indonesia, and if they are coming out of Indonesia then we are saying that, where it is safe  to do so, we stand absolutely by the policy.

PRESENTER:

But if the Indonesians stick by their guns and stay “Nope, we’re just going to turn them  around”. What do you do?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, it’s not good enough. Because from our perspective it is important that if they are  coming from Indonesia it is Indonesia’s issue. And therefore, where it is safe to do so  obviously, we will turn them around and send them back. That is something this government

did at first but it has changed its policy, now we have a hell of a lot more boats coming to  Australia.

TONY BURKE:

I just think this one is a classic example of where you need to get the detail beyond the  opening slogan. Like, it is one thing to say, as we all wish we could, if it was safe to do so  and a boat turned around and Indonesia would take them, we all wish that was possible. But  underneath the slogan you have got to have something that works. If you are heading on a  collision course to one of our most important neighbours you have got to say, "What is a  different way of being able to do this?"

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I can’t to be Mr Nice Guy anymore. I tell you why, because the cattle issue was the  biggest and most damaging issue in the relationship between Indonesia and Australia over the  last few years, when the Government stopped the export of live cattle to Indonesia, and  suddenly turned off the food supply to our nearest neighbour. That was the biggest diplomatic

issue between the two nations since East Timor. And I’d say to you, we have to have a firm  policy in Australia. And the firm policy has to be 'No more boats'. We have to stop the boats,  and where it is safe to do so, turn them around and send them to where they come from.

TONY BURKE:

But this is where we have a country that will take people. We had Malaysia, that actually will  say they will take people. They have agreed to it. You are not on a diplomatic collision  course. I don't see how you can say sending people to Indonesia when the country is wanting  to reject them and wreck the relationship with a neighbour is a good policy. And to have a  relationship with a country like Malaysia that is willing to do it is a problem

PRESENTER:

We’ll have to leave it there. Be nice to each other this week.

JOE HOCKEY:

We are always nice to each other. And Happy Saint Patrick’s Day for tomorrow.
