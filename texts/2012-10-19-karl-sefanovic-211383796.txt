TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   INTERVIEW WITH KARL STEFANOVIC,  TODAY, NINE NETWORK

Subjects: UN Security Council; border protection.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Although you were at first I think against this bid, you must be pleased now it was all worth it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I welcome the win, Karl. It was an expensive win and I think it probably owes at least as much to  Kevin Rudd as to Julia Gillard but nevertheless, a win's a win. I welcome it. Let's hope we put the next two  years on the Security Council to good use.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Gee, Kevin Rudd has been getting a lot of praise this week. You’re praising him now!

TONY ABBOTT:

And look, Kevin Rudd quite sensibly has called on the Prime Minister to get away from the gender wars and  to focus on the things that really matter to Australians and this, of course, is what I've been trying to do for  the last two or three years.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

How long do you reckon we would hold on to that seat if you get into power?

TONY ABBOTT:

Normally, the term is not renewed. It's just a two-year term, what we won today, at the cost of many, many  tens of millions of dollars and some dislocation of our ordinary diplomatic efforts. But it is two years that we  now have got at this particular top table and let's hope we can make the most of it.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Let's move on to boat people. Now we read this morning you will be pursuing a fundamental shift in  Coalition policy. First of all is that true and what will that entail?

TONY ABBOTT:

We are not putting particular time limits on how long people would stay on Nauru but we are making it  crystal clear that it could be a very long time. We have to have a system which has got deterrents built in.  That's why we will have temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell, rigorous  offshore processing at Nauru and elsewhere, and, of course, the willingness to turn the boats around where it  is safe to do so.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So, five years as it is saying the papers this morning is not out of the question. We could have these people  on Nauru for five years. How will that differ from the average stay in detention now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it is not out of the question, Karl, although, obviously, we're not putting a specific figure on particular  cases prospectively and we would work very constructively with the Nauruan Government there…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Five years is an awful long time though. You must admit five years in a detention centre and where are you  going to put them all? They will be stacking up.

TONY ABBOTT:

…and people need to understand that if they get on a boat to Australia, Nauru may not be just a brief detour  on the way here. Look, the problem at the moment, Karl, is that we've got the flow becoming a flood.  There's something like 2,000 illegal arrivals a month. The numbers are accelerating. The situation is getting  worse. Our borders are out of control. The current Government has totally lost control of the situation.  We've got to say enough is enough…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright.

TONY ABBOTT:

… and that's what the Coalition would do.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Ok, so you are shifting directions to an extent. Did you raise all of this with the Indonesian President?

TONY ABBOTT:

I'm not going into the specific details of who said what to whom, but, yes, it was a pretty full discussion with  President Yudhoyono and then there was a much fuller, more detailed discussion between Julie Bishop and  Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Did you raise the fact that as part of your policy, these people may be on Nauru for in excess of five years or  a number of years, at least?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I'm just not going to go into the specific detail, but as you can imagine, we were talking, Karl, about  the Indonesian context; the context in the seas between Australia and Indonesia, rather than the specifics or  what might have been happening at detention centres elsewhere.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

I understand. However, central to your policy is that you will turn the boats back. Surely that was raised with  the Indonesian President?

TONY ABBOTT:

And again Karl, I'm not going to go to the specific detail, because the current Government has got it itself  into all sorts of difficulties by verballing the Indonesian authorities at different times, suffice to say that the  Indonesians very much understand what we are on about and there is going to be continuing and I am sure  constructive dialogue between the Coalition and senior people in Jakarta.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

I'm sure it was awkward. Leadership can sometimes be awkward, especially when you are trying to put your  point of view across to someone who may not agree with it, but can you just confirm that you did raise it  with the Indonesian President?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we had a very full discussion of the Coalition's position. Did we discuss every last detail? Look  certainly, at…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, it is not a last detail. To be fair, this is central to what you are doing. You are saying this is going to be  the difference between your policies.

TONY ABBOTT:

And, Karl, look, I don't conduct megaphone diplomacy. I don't verbal people. I don't have discussions with  the Indonesians for my benefit, they're for Australia's benefit. We've got to stop the boats. After the  discussions, first, between myself and President Yudhoyono, second between Scott Morrison and Julie  Bishop and Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, they know exactly what we intend, and I think they are  comfortable with what we have in mind.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So they are comfortable in most levels of government, certainly at the higher levels, for you to turn back the  boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they understand that what we need, and what we want to work towards, is much stronger cooperation  between Australia and Indonesia when it comes to establishing maritime security. You see, Indonesia has a  vast sea expanse to the north as well as to the south. It has very porous borders and I think that there's a lot  that Australia can do to be helpful to Indonesia and in so doing obviously Indonesia can be helpful to  Australia.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Finally and very, very quickly, the boat load of asylum seekers from Sri Lanka who are heading or what  looks like heading our way, who have been involved in some kind of attack on a fishing vessel, do you think  they should be granted protection?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it is very important that this matter be fully investigated and if people look to have committed very  serious criminal offences on the way to Australia, well, obviously people should be treated as those who  have committed or at least allegedly committed criminal offences.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, always good to catch up with you. Thanks again, we’ll see you next week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Karl, it is a pleasure to be with you as always. I missed you last Friday and nice to be with you today.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Good on you, Tony. Go and fix your man cold!
