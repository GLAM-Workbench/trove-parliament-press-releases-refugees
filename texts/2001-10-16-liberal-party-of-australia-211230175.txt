STRENGTH THROUGH DIVERSITY - THE COALITION GOVERNMENT’S MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS, CITIZENSHIP AND SETTLEMENT SERVICES POLICY

Strength Through Diversity promotes the values that unite us as Australians - tolerance, justice and a ‘fair go’ for all.

In order to advance these values, the Coalition Government will invest an additional $47 million over four years in multicultural, citizenship and settlement programs.

Our policy seeks to develop a coalition of the community, the corporate sector and every level of government, thereby engaging all Australians in the task of building a united Australia and reaffirming our shared commitment to its democratic institutions, laws and values.

Since 1996, we have made settlement programs more accountable and outcomes-oriented.  They are now aimed at ensuring newly arrived migrants and refugee and humanitarian program entrants become independent and active participants in Australia’s society as quickly as possible.

A great deal has been achieved but we cannot rest on our laurels.  Recent events in the United States, and the fears, doubts and prejudices that have surfaced in their wake, challenge us to redouble our efforts to engender tolerance, respect for cultural diversity, and community harmony.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Commit $1 million annually to promote Australian citizenship as the single most unifying force in our community, and to encourage eligible permanent residents to take out citizenship and participate fully in our democratic society;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work with the Council for Multicultural Australia to implement The New Agenda for Multicultural Australia as a policy for all Australians, and to focus on policies that maximise the benefits of our cultural diversity; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide annual funding of $3.5 million to the Living in Harmony initiative;

PRIME MINISTER

2

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introduce an annual Living in Harmony grants round, in recognition of the fact that communities are best placed to develop the solutions to local problems and to combat racism at the grass roots; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure our settlement programs remain the most comprehensive in the world by

maintaining, on an ongoing basis, the funding first committed in the 1997/98 budget, at a cost of $29.2 million over four years.

We have long enjoyed and celebrated the manifestations of Australia’s culturaI diversity.  I believe that the commitments I have made today will ensure that our cultural diversity continues to serve an even more important purpose - that of a unifying force.

Labor’s Alternative

The Keating Government’s policies failed to promote cohesive communities.  Under Kim Beazley, nothing has changed.

The ALP national conference last year failed to discuss multicultural policy in any defining way.  Instead, they rehashed their 1998 election proposals, which centred around returning Multicultural Affairs to a branch in the Prime Minister’s Department.  Labor’s Policy Platform, a document of over 180 pages, dedicated only five paragraphs to settlement issues, their total solution to addressing the needs of migrants.

Thirteen years of Labor saw the rise of immigration policies and practices that were open to abuse and rorts.  The Australian public lost faith in the migration program as Labor pandered to some special interest groups in an effort to build their constituencies, ignoring the broader community interest.

Labor did not advance multiculturalism as an inclusive policy for all Australians and created a fertile environment for the emergence of intolerance.

Under Labor, settlement grants were distributed on political grounds rather than community needs and allowed poor management and lack of accountability to jeopardise settlement program delivery.

Labor still has no regard for service delivery or results, demonstrating a lack of genuine commitment to multiculturalism.

Highlights of the Government’s Achievements

The Howard Government has laid the foundations for a more cohesive multicultural Australian community by restoring integrity and balance to the Migration Program.  In doing so, the Coalition has re-built community confidence in the Migration Program, which is essential if the benefits of migration and our multicultural society are to be fully realised.

The Coalition believes an important part of Australian democracy is providing an opportunity for all Australians to have their say on issues of national importance, such as the Migration Program and our annual settlement priorities.  The Coalition Government has fostered an extensive annual consultative process including public forums and formal meetings with community organisations and interest groups in every State and Territory.

Australian Citizenship Australian Citizenship Australian Citizenship Australian Citizenship

The Coalition believes that Australian Citizenship is the most significant bond that unites us as a nation and is something that should be cherished and valued by all those who hold it.

Coalition policies are designed to encourage all Australians to value their citizenship and to reflect on its meaning.  The Coalition Government:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ established the Australian Citizenship Council to report on contemporary issues in Australian Citizenship policy and law.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ established Australian Citizenship Day on 17 September as a day that all Australians can celebrate citizenship annually.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ introduced Affirmation Ceremonies so that all Australians are able to publicly affirm their loyalty to Australia and its people at ceremonies held at appropriate civic occasions.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ implemented a citizenship promotion campaign designed to highlight the importance of citizenship and to encourage eligible non-citizens to take out Australian Citizenship.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ held year-long celebrations to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Australian Citizenship, to encourage Australians to reflect on the importance of citizenship.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ appointed a number of Ambassadors for Australian Citizenship to promote citizenship widely and join the government in inviting eligible non-citizens to take out Australian Citizenship.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ introduced legislation to repeal section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act, that will enable Australians to take out another citizenship without losing their Australian Citizenship.



Australian Citizenship, Australian Multiculturalism & Settlement Services 5

This important legislative change was introduced after significant community consultation and recognises the significant hardship experienced by many Australians living overseas, who for a variety of reasons, need to acquire the citizenship of their country of residence, but out of loyalty to Australia do not wish to lose their Australian Citizenship under any circumstances.

Australian Multiculturalism

The Coalition is committed to ensuring that cultural diversity is a unifying force in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole.

The Coalition strongly supports the building of Australia as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation and its democratic institutions, laws and values.

The Coalition Government:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ launched a multicultural policy statement A New Agenda for Multicultural Australia in response to the recommendations made by the National Multicultural Advisory Council.  The New Agenda emphasises the relevance of cultural diversity for every Australian and the importance of obtaining the greatest possible gains from our diversity.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ established the Council for Multicultural Australia to implement strategies contained in the New Agenda.  Importantly, the Council reports to both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, showing the commitment that the Coalition Government has to multiculturalism.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ is leading the way in developing Productive Diversity principles and management strategies, which work to recognise the economic value of Australia’s cultural diversity.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ hosted the 21st Century Business - Delivering the Diversity Dividend conference to showcase the benefits to business of strategically managing diversity in the workplace.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ is working in partnership with specialists to develop diversity management tools to help Australian business gain a competitive advantage.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ committed $12.5 million to the Living in Harmony initiative to combat racism in our society. This campaign focuses on 'what makes us all Australians' and emphasises our common values. It is these values that unite us and strengthen our ability to resist those who want to divide Australians on racial or cultural grounds.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ established Harmony Day to be celebrated on 21 March every year. This day also marks the United Nations International Day for the



6 Building Harmony

Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This day is an opportunity for all Australians to reflect on and celebrate our success as a diverse and harmonious nation, and encourages individuals, families, community groups, businesses and government agencies to participate in this important day.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  initiated  the  Immigration: the Facts campaign to inform the public of the facts about immigration and the many benefits of our multicultural society.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  developed  the  Australia 2030: Investigating the Facts in Australian Immigration project, which encourages young Australians to learn about the contribution migration has made to the development of our nation to date, and invites them to explore the question of how migration may shape their community in the future.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ appointed a number of 'Ambassadors for Truth' in immigration to promote the benefits of a balanced and effective migration program and the benefits of our cultural diversity.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ showcased Australian Multiculturalism for the world to see by hosting a multicultural theme day - the biggest event held at the Sydney Media Centre in the lead up to the Olympic Games. International and domestic media representatives were invited to see first hand our diverse but harmonious Australian way of life.

Settlement Programs Settlement Programs Settlement Programs Settlement Programs

The Coalition Government has enhanced settlement programs so that they are outcome-oriented, accountable and focused on delivering services that ensure migrants, refugee and humanitarian program entrants become independent, active participants in Australia’s society as quickly as possible.

The Coalition Government has:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ injected an additional $37 million over four years in the 1997-98 Budget to improve settlement services.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ enhanced the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) to ensure greater flexibility for our clients.  Over $94 million will be spent on delivering the AMEP this financial year with flexible learning options including full or part-time classroom tuition, distance learning or the home tutor scheme.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ established the AMEP course in Australian Citizenship so that migrants are able to learn about important aspects of Australia, such as the values and principles of Australian society, multiculturalism and reconciliation, Australia’s system of government and law and how to become an Australian Citizen, as part of their English language tuition.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ reformed the Translating and Interpreting Service to become a world class service.  Almost $18.5 million will be spent this financial year to deliver these services which now operate with enhanced



Australian Citizenship, Australian Multiculturalism & Settlement Services 7

technology enabling the service to be faster and more accessible, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ introduced a Doctors’ Priority Line - 1300 131 450 - to provide faster telephone interpreting for private doctors treating patients from a non-English speaking background.  The service is free of charge, and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call.  It provides easy access to a national pool of interpreters, ensuring doctors can communicate effectively with their patients - a significant improvement in delivering medical services, particularly in remote and regional areas.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ developed the Settlement Website to ensure that migrants are able to access valuable settlement information in areas such as employment, education and health services in Australia ‘on-line’.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ensured funds for community grants are distributed on the basis of needs and merit, with a greater focus on accountability and outcomes.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ maintained a strong and effective system of Migrant Resource Centres (MRC) and established new Migrant Service Agencies (MSA) in the Northern suburbs of Sydney and Eastern suburbs of Melbourne.  Over $24.5 million is committed annually to deliver settlement programs through the MRC/MSA network and through the Community Settlement Services Scheme.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ reviewed the performance of MRCs and MSAs and introduced new service agreements that have ensured programs are transparent, effective and well targeted to clients' needs.

Refugee and Humanitarian Program entrants have special needs. For instance many have been subjected to torture and trauma, which if left unacknowledged and untreated, can have devastating long-term effects upon their health and well-being.  It is essential these needs are identified and addressed promptly by matching individuals with settlement services that meet particular needs. The Howard Government has worked to ensure that our settlement programs are the most comprehensive in the world and has:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ initiated the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS), providing $14.3 million annually, to deliver a national framework for a more holistic, better targetted and responsive approach to the settlement needs of eligible humanitarian entrants, and to improve service delivery integration.  The model integrates seven service outcomes that are seen as crucial to the successful initial settlement of entrants.  These are Accommodation Support; Information and Orientation Assistance; Household Formation Support; Early Health Assessment and Intervention Services; Support to Proposers of Humanitarian Entrants; Community Support for Refugees; and Service Provider Support.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ worked actively with the Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council to enhance settlement services for Refugee and Humanitarian

Program entrants.  The Howard Government is very proud of the Settlement Services Guide developed by the council, which has become a vital resource for our newest arrivals.

Access and Equity

The Coalition is committed to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and to be treated with equal respect, regardless of race, colour, creed or origin.  The Coalition Government’s New Agenda for Multicultural Australia and Productive Diversity strategies are working to highlight that access and equity in the workplace is not about quotas, but about having a diversity of staff on board that can deliver bottom-line business benefits.  Our policies aim to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ deliver Government Services in line with the Charter of a Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society (Charter) across portfolios that are responsive to our culturally diverse client base;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ seek continual improvement of Government reporting in the important area of Charter implementation.  We have worked to develop methods of annual reporting that more accurately reflect the level of Charter implementation in mainstream service planning, delivery, evaluation and outcomes reporting;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ work with the Council for Multicultural Australia to increase awareness of the Charter in the private sector, so that they are able to use it as a blueprint to enhance their own service charters that cater effectively to our multicultural society.

The Way Forward

The Coalition believes it is in the nation’s best interests for all citizens to have the opportunity to share their vision for the future in a multicultural Australia.  The Coalition is committed to consulting widely with the general public, community organisations and interest groups on an annual basis on all aspects of the portfolio.

Part 1 Australian Citizenship

Australian Citizenship is the cornerstone of our inclusive and culturally diverse society.  It represents loyalty to Australia and its people, a shared belief in the democratic process, respect for the rights and liberties of other Australians and a commitment to uphold and obey Australia’s laws.

The status of Australian Citizen has played a unique and important part in our nationhood.  It has given all Australians a unique legal identity adding to the sense of who we are, and, importantly, has provided a vehicle for welcoming over 3.1 million migrants as full participants in our society.

The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ commit $1 million annually to promote Australian Citizenship as the single most unifying force in our community and promote eligible permanent residents to take out citizenship and participate fully in our democratic society.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ build on the success of our recent inaugural Citizenship Day, so that 17 September becomes an annual day of celebration for all Australians to celebrate the meaning and importance of our citizenship.  It is important to reflect on the changes that have shaped our nation and the role both new and Australian born citizens have played in building Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ re-introduce the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment Bill. This legislation will bring about a number of changes to citizenship law, notably the repeal of section 17, that will allow Australians who acquire another citizenship to retain their Australian Citizenship.

Part 2 Australian Multiculturalism

Multiculturalism emphasises the relevance of cultural diversity for every Australian and the importance of obtaining the greatest possible gains from our diversity.



10 Building Harmony

The Coalition recognises the goals of the Living in Harmony initiative are ongoing.  Long term projects need to be in place to address racism and promote community harmony.

The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ commit $3.5 million annually to the Living in Harmony initiative demonstrating the Government’s serious commitment to promoting community harmony.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ have an annual Living in Harmony grants round to ensure that local community organisations have an opportunity to put forward local programs to meet local needs.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ enhance the Living in Harmony Website to incorporate the work programs of successful community grants projects.  This may inspire other organisations to initiate similar projects in their own communities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  build  Harmony Day on 21 March each year as a widely celebrated community day for all Australians to reflect on and celebrate our success as a diverse and harmonious nation.  This day appropriately coincides with the United Nations Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

Part 3 Settlement Services

Settlement Programs contribute enormously to the successful adjustment of migrants and humanitarian program entrants upon arrival in Australia and assist them in becoming full and active participants in Australia’s democratic society.

The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ maintain the increased level of funding to the AMEP enabling valuable Coalition initiated programs to continue, particularly:

- the Special Preparatory Program (SPP) for humanitarian and refugee clients who have special learning needs as a consequence of their pre migration experiences, including torture and trauma.  This client group is particularly disadvantaged and requires additional preparatory assistance to overcome their refugee experience and enable them to fully participate in their AMEP entitlement and provides for up to 100 hours of additional tuition.

- the AMEP Home Tutor Scheme enabling community agencies providing English language tuition to migrants to provide training and support of language tutors and curriculum planning and materials.



Australian Citizenship, Australian Multiculturalism & Settlement Services 11

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ maintain the level of funding to the IHSS to ensure comprehensive, well targeted settlement services are available to assist refugee and humanitarian entrants begin to rebuild their lives in Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ maintain the level of funding for the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) designed to strengthen and build capacity within the community to meet the settlement needs of recently arrived migrants and refugees.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ continue to develop the CSSS rural and regional network recognising the unique needs of migrants, refugee and humanitarian program entrants in regional areas.  Migrants moving into regional areas are often faced with unique hurdles to overcome and support services may be harder to access, unlike larger cities, where migrants often have family networks and friends who have migrated before them for support.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ evaluate the merit of expanding the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) to overseas markets utilising existing technology.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ further promote the Doctors Priority Line to ensure the service is fully utilised by doctors.
