BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

A vessel has been intercepted today by the Royal Australian Navy patrol boat HMAS  Albany, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, two nautical miles west  of Ashmore Island.

Initial indications are that there are 49 people on board.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, said the successful interception demonstrated the  effectiveness of Border Protection Command’s surveillance program.

“Border Protection Command’s surveillance operates every day of the year to protect  Australia’s mainland and includes aerial, sea and land patrols to detect and respond to  maritime threats.

“The group will now be transferred to Christmas Island where they will be detained and  undergo health, security and other checks to establish their identity and reasons for their  voyage.”
