DON’T TRANSFER VILLAWOOD DETAINEES -  SET THEM FREE!

Cunningham MP Michael Organ has called on the Federal  government to free asylum seekers being held in Sydney’s  Villawood detention centre.

“I have been to Villawood and met many of the people being held  there, and the last thing they need is to be shipped out to the  backblocks of South Australia where they’ll have no access to the  support networks they have been able to build up at Villawood”, Mr.  Organ said.

“I had lunch just last week with a group of temporary protection visa  holders who help provide some of those support networks and I  know just how difficult it is to provide even basic assistance to  people held in Villawood. Moving families to South Australia will  significantly affect legal moves to allow them to remain in Australia,  with those cases already being heard in Sydney, with applicants  represented by Sydney legal practitioners. The Villawood detainees  should be granted temporary protection visas now and allowed to  live in the community.”

“Transferring them to Baxter is simply piling inhumanity on  inhumanity”, Mr. Organ said.
