STATEMENT  FOR PRESS

THE MINISTER FOR THE *-V'i

CAPITAL TERRITORY

The Minister for the- Capital Territory, Mr Bob

approved community and welfare grants for 1979-

accordance with the recommendations made to him

Territory House of Assembly. (Details attached)

Ellicott, said today he had

80 totalling $726,000 in

by the Australian Capital

Mr Ellicott said that some of the grants were subject to conditions and these

wpuld be notified to the successful applicants when the amounts were paid.

He said he hoped that cheques for the amounts approved would be forwarded to

the various organisations concerned about the end of the month.

Two grants, one to Dr. M. Gore for a grant of $10,000 for establishment of a

Science Centre for Canberra, and the other to Jobless Action for a grant of

$14,000 for the. salary of a Co-ordinator for a project at Ainslie Villag'e,

had been deferred as suggested by the House of Assembly.

Mr Ellicott said he regretted that the recommendations of the House of

Assembly had been made public before he could'consider them. He had planned

to give the recommendations independent consideration and, if necessary,’

discuss them with the Assembly before they were announced. Prior publicity,

however, had made this impossible. '

Mr Ellicott said the premature announcement had created expectations in those

organisations which had been recommended for grants by the Assembly. On this

occasion he did not propose to disturb them.
