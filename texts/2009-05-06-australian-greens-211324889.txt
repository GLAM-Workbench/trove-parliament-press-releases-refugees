Immigration Budget dollars should have humanitarian  focus





Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says money allocated within the upcoming Federal Budget to  manage the arrival of asylum seekers in Australia must be focussed on increasing humanitarian  efforts, rather than punitive measures.

It has been reported today that border security will receive a boost of up to $500 million in next  Tuesday Ã¯Â¿Â½s Federal Budget to combat people smuggling. The reports follow the interception of a boat  carrying presumed asylum seekers on Tuesday, the 11th this year.

Ã¯Â¿Â½The recent arrivals of people seeking asylum in Australia points to humanitarian problems in the  global community and increased refugee movement around the world, Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Senator Hanson-Young.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Australia has an important role to play, but we must make sure that we play the right role.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Australia should not be spending millions of dollars on just pushing people in need back from our  borders. Rather, Australia should work on creating safer, more humane pathways for people to seek  asylum. Ã¯Â¿Â½

Senator Hanson-Young also pointed to the detention facilities on Christmas Island, 1600km from the  Australian mainland, as an expensive, inefficient and inhumane place to process claims and carry  out checks on asylum seekers.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Christmas Island should not be a permanent solution to fulfilling our international obligations to  asylum seekers, Ã¯Â¿Â½ she said.†

Ã¯Â¿Â½Its far-flung location - further away from the mainland than the areas where asylum seekers  generally are intercepted - makes detaining asylum seekers there a costly, laborious policy.

Ã¯Â¿Â½More now than ever in these tight financial times, the Christmas Island detention facilities should be  closed and all asylum seekers brought to the Australian mainland for their checks to be carried out  and claims processed."
