A Global New Deal:

Australia and the UN Millennium Development Goals





Speech to the Australia Institute of International Affairs  9 August 2005 , Canberra

Bob Sercombe MP,  Shadow Minister for Overseas Aid and Pacific Islands





Introduction - the New Deal

When Franklin Roosevelt assumed the US Presidency in 1933, America was facing one  of its gravest crises.

The Great Depression had devastated large parts of the country.

Economic growth had ground to halt, bank liquidity had dried up, and many citizens had  to queue up for bread hand-outs.

In his Inaugural Address, Roosevelt said

Our  ability  to  pay  has  fallen;  government  of  all  kinds  is  faced  by  serious   curtailment  of  income;  the  withered  leaves  of  industrial  enterprise  lie  on  every   side; farmers find no markets for their produce; a host of unemployed citizens face  the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return.

In  this  nation  I  see  millions  of  citizens  who  at  this  very  moment  are  denied  the   necessities of life.

I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meagre that the pall of family  disaster hangs over them every day.

I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot  and the lot of their children.

I  see  millions  lacking  the  means  to  buy  the  products  of  farm  and  factory  and  by   their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions.

To respond to this crisis, Roosevelt created the New Deal program.

Roosevelt recognised that government intervention, that effective public policy, was  needed to protect the livelihood and dignity of individual citizens.

It wasn’t enough to leave the solutions just to the market, or to rely on individual  American states to solve the crisis on their own.

A major, coordinated response was required - a New Deal between the federal  government and its citizens.

A Global New Deal

Today, many leaders of developing countries could make a similar speech to Roosevelt’s  Inaugural Address.

Their farmers cannot find markets for their produce because of massive first world  subsidies; their citizens are unemployed, or toil with little return; and their government’s  ability to pay has fallen because of unsustainable debt levels.

There are so many in the world who face the same desperate circumstances which  American citizens faced in those dark years of the Great Depression.  Only today’s  citizens living in extreme poverty are much worse off again.

Third world poverty is the great moral and economic challenge of our times.

Tony Blair has said, ‘There can be no new consensus, no new order, no stability, without  tackling the appalling poverty that afflicts nearly a half of the world’s population.’

And yet, for all the devastation, for all the appalling waste of lives, there is still hope.

There is now a Global New Deal, between the governments of the world and the citizens  of developing countries.

The UN Millennium Development Goals are the Global New Deal.

Together, developed and developing countries have committed to the following Goals:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ eradicating extreme poverty and hunger;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ achieving universal primary education;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ promoting gender equality and empowering women;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ reducing child mortality;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ improving maternal health;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ combating HIV/AIDs, malaria and other diseases;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ensuring environmental sustainability; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ developing a global partnership for development.

Aid has been criticised in the past because of the lack of clear targets by which  effectiveness can be measured, and a failure to grapple with the responsibilities of both  developed and developing countries to improve outcomes.

As Roosevelt recognised in the American New Deal, there are responsibilities on both  sides of the equation.

The Millennium Development Goals answer this challenge.

As part of the Global New Deal, there is a commitment to good governance on the  developing country side.



On the developed country side there is a commitment to meeting the necessary aid  commitments, reducing developing country debt, tackling the trade barriers preventing  developing country exports and addressing climate change.

Jeffrey Sachs is Kofi Annan’s adviser on the implementation of the Millennium  Development Goals.

In his book, Ending Global Poverty, he writes that the development relationship between  richer and poorer countries to this point has often been reminiscent of the old joke from  Soviet workers - the government pretends to pay us, and we pretend to work.



By this, he means that the first world has pretended to pay the right amount of aid, and  developing countries have pretended to implement the reforms needed to promote  growth.

The Global New Deal means we can finally move beyond this flawed development  relationship.

Together, we have a clear vision to work towards - using these Goals as a framework, to  halve extreme poverty by 2015, and to make extreme poverty history by 2025.





What’s the Howard government doing?

What’s the Howard Government doing to meet our part of the Global New Deal?

In short, not very much.

Unlike most countries, Australia has not set out a plan for assisting to realise the  Millennium Development Goals.

In 2002, at a UN conference at Monterrey, Australia was one of only two developed  countries which failed to provide a national action plan.

Nor has Australia committed to the necessary amount of assistance needed to realise this  Global New Deal.

With leaders around the world busy committing to the right amount of aid, and proposing  innovative new ways of delivering aid, where is Australia?

John Howard has been silent.

Alexander Downer has promised to provide a report on the eighth Millennium  Development Goal, of developing a global partnership for development. I look forward to  the report - but what about Goals one through to seven?

What’s the Howard Government’s fundamental objection to these Goals, of eradicating  extreme poverty, of achieving universal primary education, of reducing child mortality?

I’ve been extremely disappointed, too, that Mr Howard hasn’t yet committed to going to  the UN Millennium Plus Five Development Summit in September.

At this summit, leaders from around the world will discuss progress towards achieving  the Global New Deal, and next steps. Will Australia be missing in action?

The Howard government is out of touch with community sentiment on third world  poverty, and incompetent in the execution of the aid that it does provide.

We see this with the collapse of the one billion dollar Enhanced Cooperation Program  with Papua New Guinea.

The Enhanced Cooperation Program was vital for helping Papua New Guinea to improve  its policing programs, and, in doing so, helping to protect Australia’s security.

But the program collapsed because the Howard government didn’t lay the necessary  groundwork, and didn’t approach our neighbour in a spirit of partnership.

We have a clear choice as Australians, and as a global community.

We can say a world where a child dies from malnutrition every two seconds is  acceptable, that that’s just the way of the world.

Or we can say we’re better than that.

The Howard government doesn’t seem to think we are.

But, based on Australians’ generosity following the tsunami, I believe we are better than  that.

For example, following the tsunami, 200 000 Australians donated to World Vision who  had not had contact with the organisation previously.

I now want to tell you how a Labor Government would ensure Australia’s aid was used to  help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.





How Labor would do better



One overriding objective - the reduction of poverty.

The one, overriding objective of Australia’s aid program should be reducing poverty in  developing countries.

This may seem obvious, and it is, but it’s not so obvious to the Howard government.

If it was obvious to the Howard government, they wouldn’t be using the aid budget to  house asylum seekers on Nauru.

To keep up our part of the Global New Deal, we should be using the Millennium  Development Goals as a framework for our development assistance.

The Goals would bring clarity to our aid program, and keep it focused on basic poverty  reduction.

We need a comprehensive, integrated approach for implementing the Millennium  Development Goals in our immediate region, where we are the primary aid donor.

We also need a coordinated approach with other donors to realising these Goals in the  rest of the world.

Good governance programs will continue to be an important part of the aid program  under a Labor government. But, at 36% of the aid program in this year’s budget, we  believe spending on good governance has been at the expense of basic poverty reduction.



For example, only 9% of the aid budget is devoted to rural development, but in Papua  New Guinea, our major aid recipient, 85% of the population live in rural areas.

In tackling this great challenge, of seemingly intractable extreme poverty in some  countries, we must be prepared to try new and innovative ways to secure better  development outcomes.

But not every aid project will be successful. There are some critics that look for failure,  and, finding it, dismiss all aid in all circumstances.

Roosevelt faced similar criticisms when he was implementing the American New Deal.  He said,  It  must  be  recognised  that  when  an  enterprise  of  this  character  is  extended  over   more than three thousand counties throughout the Nation, there may be occasional

instances of inefficiency, bad management or misuse of funds. When cases of this  kind occur, there will be those who will try to tell you that the exceptional failure  is characteristic of the entire endeavour. It should be remembered that in every big  job there are some imperfections.

Would it have been better not to attempt the American New Deal because not every  project would be successful? As Roosevelt said, ‘it is common sense to take a method  and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.’



The biggest job of all is the quest to end extreme global poverty. Should we not join the  quest to realise the Millennium Development Goals because the journey ahead will at  times be difficult?

Of course, together, we must work to root out the cancer of corruption and poor  governance, and strive to make every aid project successful.

But we must not let the excuse of fear of failure stand in the way of the attempt.



Partnership

We also need to establish a better sense of partnership with developing countries.

The Millennium Development Goals are a compact - it’s not about developed countries  dictating priorities and projects to developing countries. It’s about a partnership, with  developed and developing countries working together to achieve mutually agreed  priorities.

But the Howard government’s arrogant, heavy-handed approach reduces the chances of  establishing a genuine partnership, which is essential to achieving better development  outcomes.

So, I commit a future Labor government to working with developing countries in a  greater spirit of partnership.

We need to approach developing countries with a degree of humility, that we might  actually learn something from them, that not all the wisdom and knowledge will flow in  one direction.

We need a more organic flow of ideas and people in both directions.

Let me give an example of how this might work in practice.

Looking at the Enhanced Cooperation Program with Papua New Guinea, my criticism all  along was not with the basic idea of the program.

But I always argued that rather than just sending Australian police to Papua New Guinea,  we should also have Papua New Guinean police come to Australia to work.

They could have been sent to Australia as a reward for high performance, and  participated in our community policing programs.



I believe such an initiative would have removed a lot of the angst from the Enhanced  Cooperation Program, and it may still be operating today if such an initiative had been  implemented.



A more strategic approach

As part of the Global New Deal, we also need a more strategic approach to our aid  program.

Roosevelt knew the problems of the Great Depression couldn’t be solved in a year. The  Millennium Development Goals appropriately set ten and twenty year targets for what the  international community needs to achieve.

There are areas where developing countries must do better by themselves and their  citizens to realise these Goals, in adopting market-oriented policies, and rooting out  corruption.



But if Australia wants to facilitate this reform, we need to commit to multi-year aid  programs to support countries through the reform process.

We also need a more integrated approach to our aid program.

Earlier this year, I was able to visit Daru, in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea.

AusAID built the police station there. Unfortunately, the police station is now at risk of  crumbling because of water running under the foundations, and the police boat doesn’t  have a functioning engine.

It’s no good building a police station if there’s no petrol for the cars, or an engine for the  boat. It’s no good building a school if there’s no money for chalk, or for text books.

We need to take a more holistic approach to our aid projects.



Focus on the Asia Pacific

The current focus on Africa is welcome, and well overdue.

However, there is still a great deal of work to be done in the Asia Pacific.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Asia Pacific has fourteen of the world’s least developed countries.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Two million children under 5 years will die in these least developed countries by  2015.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Less than 50% of the population in Bangladesh are literate.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The infant mortality rate in Cambodia is 96 per 1000 births.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A male born in Papua New Guinea in 2000 can only expect to live 55 years.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Unemployment in Nauru is 80%.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Around 40 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, and 60  million do not have access to adequate sanitation.

Australia is a global player with global interests, and this should be reflected in our  development assistance.

Nonetheless, the Asia Pacific is our neighbourhood.

Australia must play, and be seen to play, a leading role in development assistance to the  region if we expect like-minded countries to also donate aid to the Asia Pacific.



A broad approach to countering terrorism

We also need a broader approach to countering terrorism in our region.

To  this  end,  supporting  mainstream  Islamic  education  should  be  a  major  priority   within Australia’s aid program.

To give effect to this, Australia should lead a consortium of donors to implement grass-roots education initiatives, in collaboration with organisations such as former President  Wahid’s in Indonesia, Nahtalul Ulama.



Such initiatives would provide students with real and effective alternatives to those  Islamic schools promulgating extremist teachings - and correct the Howard government’s  short-term, reactive approach to counter-terrorism.



Transparency

Finally, the Howard government is always keen to lecture developing countries on the  need for transparency.

Of course, transparency is important in developing countries, but here’s my challenge to  the Howard government - how about introducing some transparency into the aid  program?



In this year’s budget, over $170 million of our aid is being spent on government  departments other than AusAID.  This is money that, according to the government’s own  budget papers is ‘not attributable to a particular country or region.’ What’s it being spent  on then - stationery supplies?

Why won’t the Howard government provide a complete list of all aid projects, and the  companies that are receiving all the AusAID contracts?



The Howard government in its arrogance isn’t prepared to share this information with the  Australian community.

Until the Howard government is prepared to introduce some transparency to the aid  program, it has no credibility to lecture developing countries.

And without this transparency, we can’t reliably measure the contribution Australia is  making to its part of the Global New Deal.

So I also commit a future Labor government to far greater transparency in the aid  program.





Conclusion

In late 1943, the American press began questioning the utility of the New Deal given the  grave external challenge of World War II.  It was Eleanor Roosevelt who responded, ‘the  future is going to require a New Deal not only to meet the needs of our citizens, but the

needs of the world.’

And, as Franklin Roosevelt said, freedom from want requires ‘economic understandings  which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants - everywhere  in the world.’



That is the challenge before us now.

The Labor Party has a proud tradition of reaching out to those less fortunate than  ourselves.

When Chifley gave his ‘Light on the Hill’ speech he wasn’t just talking about helping  people in Australia.

He said, ‘We have a great objective - the light on the hill - which we aim to reach by  working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping  hand.’

It is in this spirit that I commit myself to working within the Labor Party, and with the  Australian community, to realise the Global New Deal before us, and to resolve the great  challenge of our times.

Thank you.
