KAMPUCHEA CONFERENCE ;  FOREIGN MINISTER'S  STATEMENT

Following is the text of the statement by the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Tony Street M.P.,   to the International Conference on Kampuchea in New York  on 14 July:

MR CHAIRMAN

I SHOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR ELECTION TO PRESIDE  OVER THIS IMPORTANT AND HISTORIC CONFERENCE. 1 AM SURE THAT LINDER  YOLIR CHAIRMANSHIP THE CONFERENCE WILL MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION  TO THE CONTINUING SEARCH FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE  KAMPUCHEAN PROBLEM.

THE NEED FOR AN EARLY COMPREHENSIVE AND LASTING SOLUTION TO  THE KAMPUCHEAN PROBLEM IS PLAIN. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS  ALWAYS HELD THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PEACEFUL. AND NOT A MILITARY  SETTLEMENT IN KAMPUCHEA, BUT THE COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH-EAST  ASIAN REGION SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT ALONE.  MANY ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM ARE INTERNATIONAL, PARTICULAR!Y THE

PRESENCE OF MAJOR POWER RIVALRY IN THE REGION AND THEY CAN ONLY  BE RESOLVED AT THE INTERNATIONA! LEVEL. IT IS FOR THIS REASON  THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED MOVES FOR AND WELCOMES  THE CONVENING OF THIS CONFERENCE. IT IS A TIMELY AND CONSTRUCTIVE  MEANS OF CARRYING FORWARD THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.

THE BASIS FOR A SETTLEMENT WHICH WOULD MEET THE LEGITIMATE  CONCERNS OF ALL THE PARTIES CONCERNED IS CONTAINED IN THE  RESOLUTIONS ON THE SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA WHICH WERE PASSED  BY OVERWHELMING MAJORITIES AT THE 34 TH AND 35TH SESSIONS OF THE  UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THIS CONFERENCE HAS BEEN CONVENED

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF LAST YEAR'S RESOLUTION  WHICH CALLED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AT WHICH ALL.  CONFLICTING PARTIES AND OTHERS CONCERNED WOULD BE REPRESENTED. . THE AIM OF THIS CONFERENCE WAS TO NEGOTIATE A COMPREHENSIVE  SETTLEMENT IN KAMPUCHEA EMBRACING ALL THE POLITICAL., MILITARY,  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM. THE ASEAN COUNTRIES  WHO SPONSORED RESOLUTION 35/6 HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO

1 2

IMPLEMENT ITS PROVISIONS. THEY DESERVE A SPECIAL TRIBUTE FOR THE  EFFORTS THEY HAVE HADE TO HAVE THIS CONFERENCE CONVENED.

.  THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT AMONG ALL. COUNTRIES REPRESENTED  HERE. AS TO OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR KAMPUCHEA. WE ALI WISH TO SEE A  KAMPUCHEA THAT IS SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT, WHICH DOES NOT THREATEN  AND IS NOT THREATENED BY OTHERS - A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE KHMER PEOPLE

CAN LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY, FREE FROM OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE AND, OF COURSE, FREE FROM THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES IN THEIR OWN  LAND. THIS WILL. NOT HAPPEN UNTIL. THERE IS A WILLINGNESS TO SET ASIDE

DIFFERENCES AND ENGAGE IN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS. .

THE PREREQUISITES FOR AN ACCEPTABLE SETTLEMENT ARE THE WITHDRAWAL  OF FOREIGN FORCES FROM KAMPUCHEA (SEMI COLON) AN ACT OF SELFÂ­ DETERMINATION BY THE KHMER PEOPLE (SEMI COLON) THE EBTABl I SUMENT OF  CONDITIONS WHICH WILL. ALLOW KHMER REFUGEES TO RETURN (SEMI COLON)  CONTINUED HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE KHMER PEOPLE(  SEMI COLON) A GUARANTEE OF NON.INTERFERENCE IN THE INTERNAL. AFFAIRS OF KAMPUCHEA

(SEMI COLON) AND AN UNDERTAKING THAT A FULLY INDEPENDENT KAMPUCHEA  WILL NOT ACT AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF ITS NEIGHBOURS.

NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE EASILY ACHIEVED. HOWEVER WE MUST  CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS A SOLUTION BROADLY ACCEPTABLE TO ALL THE  PARTIES INVOLVED. AUSTRALIA DOES NOT DENY THAT VIETNAM HAS CERTAIN  LEGITIMATE SECURITY INTERESTS OF ITS OWN.  HOWEVER, THAT IS NO  JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR INVASION OF A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY: EVEN SO,  WE DO NOT INSIST ON AN IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS FROM  KAMPUCHEA. A PHASED WITHDRAWAL WOULD AVOID THE CREATION OF A POWER -   VACUUM WHICH COULD RESULT IN A RETURN TO POWER OF THE POL POT REG I MEÂ­

TRE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THAT THE PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA  HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN FORM OF GOVERNMENT WITHOUT  EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE OR COERCION. '

;  THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THE KHMERS CAN EXERCISE THEIR ENTITLEMENT  TO A GENUINE ACT OF SELF-DETERMINATION IS THROUGH GENUINELY FREE  ELECTIONS TO BE HELD IN KAMPUCHEA. WE DO NOT ACCEPT THAT THE GENERAL  ELECTIONS HELD IN KAMPUCHEA ON 1  MAY THIS YEAR WERE A TRUE TEST OF  THE. POLITICAL. WILL OF THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE. THERE WAS NO

INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION, CANDIDACY WAS RESTRICTED TO THOSE  ACCEPTABLE TO VIETNAM AND THE HENG 5AMR IN REGIME, AND THERE WAS NOT  WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE FORCES.  THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT  RECOGNISE THE HENG 5AMRIN REGIME,  AND OUR POSITION WILL. IN NO WAY BE  AFFECTED BY THE ELECTIONS OF 1 MAY.

MR CHAIRMAN, THE DISASTERS WHICH HAVE BEFALLEN KAMPUCHEA,  ITS  PEOPLE AND ITS CULTURE ARE POSSIBLY WITHOUT PARALLEL. IN MODERN TIMES. IN THE PAST DECADE THE KHMER PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED WAR. GENOCIDE _______ FAMINE, AND INVASION AND OCCUPATION.OF THEIR COUNTRY BY FOREIGN

FORCES. KAMPUCHEA IS A DEVASTATED COUNTRY. THE KHMER PEOPLE MUST BE  GIVEN THE CHANCE TO BEGIN AGAIN. MANY OF THEIR MORE PRESSING  HUMANITARIAN NEEDS ARE GRADUALLY BEING MET, LARGELY DUE TO THE  GENEROSITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL. COMMUNITY WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORT IN THAT COUNTRY. NEVERTHELESS, KAMPUCHEA  STILL FACES IMMENSE PROBLEMS.

ABOVE ALL, FOREIGN FORCES REMAIN IN KAMPUCHEA AND DEPRIVE THE  KHMER PEOPLE OF THEIR BASIC HUMAN RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY  IN THEIR HOMELAND WITH A GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING.

THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN KAMPUCHEA REMAINS UNRESOLVED. THERE ARE  STILL SOME 200,000 VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN KAMPUCHEA. AND A SIGNIFICANT  PROPORTION OF THESE ARE STATIONED CLOSE TO THE THAI- KAMPUCHEA  BORDER, THIS VIETNAMESE PRESENCE IN KAMPUCHEA IS CHALLENGED BY FORCES  BELONGING TO VARIOUS KHMER GROUPS. WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO BRING THESE  GROUPS TOGETHER TO FORM A UNITED FRONT. A NATIONAL COALITION  REPRESENTATIVE OF THE KHMER PEOPLE.

THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONFLICT NOT ONLY PROLONGS THE SUFFERING  OF THE KHMER PEOPLE BUT IMPEDES THE LONG SLOW PROCESS OF  RECONSTRUCTION IN KAMPUCHEA. THE MILITARY SITUATION, THOUGH  RELATIVELY QUIET AT THE MOMENT, IS UNPREDICTABLE AND UNSTABLE, AND

THERE IS THE EVER PRESENT RISK OF A SPILLOVER OF HOSTILITIES INTO  THAILAND. THIS WOULD HAVE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  THAILAND AND PEACE AND STABILITY IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA.

THE EFFECT THE TENSION AND INSECURITY HAVE HAD ON THE KHMER  PEOPLE IS VIVIDLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO  FLEE THEIR HOMELAND. AT PRESENT THERE ARE SOME 120,000 KHMER REFUGEES  IN HOLDING CAMPS IN THAILAND AND PERHAPS ANOTHER 100,000 DISPLACED  PERSONS LIVING ALONG THE THAI KAMPUCHEA BORDER. MANY WANT TO RETURN  TO THEIR HOMES AND ASSIST IN MAKING KAMPUCHEA ONCE AGAIN AN  ECONOMICALLY SELF-SUFFICIENT NATION.

ONLY THEN WILl.. IT. BE POSSIBLE TO LIFT THE BURDENS CARRIED BY  THAILAND, THE REGION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSUMES THAI THE MAJORITY'OF REFUGEES  AND DISPLACED KHHERB WILL WISH TO RETURN TO KAMPUCHEA VOLUNTARILY. IN  CONDITIONS OF PEACE AND SECURITY. HOWEVER, THE CHANCES' FOR SUCCESSFUL  REPATRIATION WILL DEPEND ON THE RESTORATION OF NORMAL LIVING  CONDITIONS IN KAMPUCHEA AND THE CONCLUSION OF A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT  ACCEPTABLE TO THE KHMER PEOPLE THEMSELVES. FOR ITS PART, MY  GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT WISH TO  RETURN TO KAMPUCHEA. WE REMAIN PREPARED TO PLAY OUR PART IN HELPING  TO RESOLVE THIS HUMAN PROBLEM.

AS I SAID EARLIER, INTERNATIONAL AND VOLUNTARY AGENCY RELIEF

ÃÂ

PROGRAMS HAVE DONE MUCH TO ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING OF THE KHMER  PEOPLE. THE INTERNATIONAL. AGENCIES HAVE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB IN  VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. NEVERTHELESS THE SITUATION REMAINS  PRECARIOUS AND IT IS IMPORTANT I  HAT THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED TO DATE BE  CONSOLIDATED TO PREVENT A RETURN TO THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS OF THE  LAST TWO YEARS.

THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE HAVE MADE MAJOR  CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL. PROGRAMS OF HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR  KHMERS WITHIN KAMPUCHEA, IN THAILAND AND ALONG THE THAI- KAMPUCHEAN  BORDER. TO DATE, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE AVAILABLE MORE  THAN DOLLARS US 20 MILLION AND, IN ADDITION, THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE  DONATED DOLL.ARB US 11 MILLION. AUSTRALIA WILl. GIVE CAREFUL.

CONSIDERATION TO ANY FURTHER REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN  ASSISTANCE TO KAMPUCHEA.

MR CHAIRMAN, I HAVE OUTLINED SOME OF THE. BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR A  SETTLEMENT IN KAMPUCHEA AND STABILITY IN THE REGION. HOWEVER. WE  MUST BE REALISTIC IN OUR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED. WE  HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE PROBLEMS OF KAMPUCHEA COULD BE EASILY  RESOLVED. FIRST OF ALL, THERE MUST BE A COMMITMENT FROM ALL. CONCERNED

TO A PEACEFUL. SETTLEMENT BASED UPON THE RIGHTS OF THE KHMER PEOPLE  THEMSELVES. IT IS THEREFORE A MATTER OF GREAT REGRET THAT VIETNAM AND  THE SOVIET UNION HAVE DECLINED TO ATTEND THIS SESSION OfÂ· THE  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KAMPUCHEA. MY GOVERNMENT HAS FULLY  SUPPORTED ATTEMPTS BY THE UN SECRETARY-GENERAL, BY ASEAN COUNTRIES  AND OTHERS TO ENCOURAGE VIETNAM AND THE SOVIET UNION TO ATTEND THIS  CONFERENCE.

OUR CHANCES OF MAKING PROGRESS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER IF THEY .   HAD PARTICIPATED. VIETNAM ITSELF IS THE GREATEST LOSER THROUGH  PROLONGING ITS SELF-IMPOSED ISOLATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL  COMMUNITY, AND BY ITS REFUSAL TO DATE TO RECOGNISE THAI FOR THEIR

PART ITS NEIGHBOURS ALSO HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS AND CONCERNS.

THE ABSENCE OF VIETNAM AND THE SOVIET UNION MEANS THAT THIS  CONFERENCE CANNOT REALISTICALLY HOPE TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT AT  THIS SESSION. BUT WE SHOULD SEEK TO ESTABLISH THE CLIMATE AND  FRAMEWORK WHICH WILL ALLOW NEGOTIATIONS TO PROCEED. IN THIS REGARD, I  NOTE THAT THE ASEAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENDORSED THE CONCEPT OF ON-GOING

CONSULTATIONS AMONG COUNTRIES OF THE REGION.

AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS A CONTINUING DIALOGUE. WITH VIETNAM, SINCE THIS  CAN PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPLORING IDEAS FOR A PEACEFUL  SETTLEMENT, AND ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE  PARTIES MOST DIRECTLY CONCERNED.

MR CHAIRMAN, I HAVE OUTLINED IN SOME DETAIL. AUSTRALIAN VIEWS ON  THE SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA. WE ARE NOT AS DIRECTLY AFFECTED AS THE

THE VISIT TO THE REGION BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL'S SPECIAL  REPRESENTATIVE, MR ES-5AAFE, ALSO PROVIDED A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR  HIM TO GAIN, AT FIRST HAND, THE VIEWS OF THOSE DIRECTLY CONCERNED.

MR CHAIRMAN, A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN MADE AS TO WHAT  THIS CONFERENCE MIGHT HOPE TO ACHIEVE. .

NONE OF US HERE EXPECTS A FINAL OUTCOME, BUT WE DO EXPECT  CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO PATIENT AND PERSISTENT WORK TOWARDS AN  EVENTUAL SETTLEMENT. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT REGARDS THE CONFERENCE  AS AN ESSENTIAL. PART OF THIS PROCESS. AFTER THIS SESSION. WE ENVISAGE  THAT THE CONFERENCE WILL ADJOURN, HAVING MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR  FURTHER WORK TO PROCEED, AND THAT THE CONFERENCE ITSELF WILL RESUME  SOMETIME AFTER THE 36TH SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. IT IS OUR  SINCERE HOPE THAT, WHEN IT DOES, ALL CONFLICTING PARTIES AND OTHERS

CONCERNED WILL BE REPRESENTED AND WILL BE PREPARED TO WORK TOWARDS A  PEACEFUL SOLUTION.
