NEW ZEALAND DEFENCE 
POLICY - AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE

Â

Â

Dr Mapp, distinguished guests, parliamentary 
colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.

Â

I kno  w that you understand that in politics, we have enormous resources 
to have speeches written for us. But these are my thoughts and I’m 
delighted to have a chance to speak to you tonight.

Â

There are some more forward comments I will make tomorrow.

Â

My particular interest in military history is the Eastern Front, WWII 
from June 1941 onwards. About Stalingrad (at Christmas 1942-43), Churchhill 
wrote “the hinge of fate turned”… That’s the case in all military 
or political endeavour - we are never quite sure when it will turn, 
but turn it will and the old saying that the price of freedom is eternal 
vigilance is as true now as ever.

Â

Defence planning gives the political leadership the options to best 
protect its people - simple. But as political leaders in periods of 
stability, we must give our defence planners the firm objectives necessary 
to provide credible options. This certainly is the debate starting point.

Â

Perhaps I might start by putting Australians current defence debate 
in context - because it puts in perspective our shared place in the 
world and the only way Australians think about your ongoing defence 
problems (and the decision you must make in preparing for government 
in two years time).

Â

In Australia, both traditionally and recently, defence issues have 
been substantially bipartisan.

Â

If you put aside our criticisms since coming to Government of quite 
legitimate issues like the purchase of two rusting 30-year-old US heavy 
landing ships (now repaired and one doing an irreplaceable job in the 
Solomans) and the Collins Class problem (both in cost overruns and combat 
systems question marks). We speak generally with one voice. A good example 
was the fact that recently Dr Mapp was able to meet with the former 
ALP Senator, Stephen Loosely - now a high profile corporate lawyer 
who served recently on Prime Minister Howard’s Defence Consultative 
Committee that has just finished its public deliberations on Australia’s 
future defence needs (copies available).

Â

This committee, set up earlier this year under the chairmanship of 
former Foreign Minister, Ambassador Andrew Peacock, held meetings right 
around Australia. It attracted its fair share of old codgers wanting 
their 303s returned to protect their womenfolk against marauding boat 
people but importantly, it did what I know all of you know needs to 
be done in the defence debate in New Zealand - and that is it helped 
give public ownership to the debate. This is a common problem to both 
Australia and New Zealand.

Â

Peacetime priorities tend not to generate much interest however it 
goes without saying that if you are going to give a higher priority 
to defence expenditure then you have to have the support of both our 
taxpayers.

Â

And when you remember that all politics is 
local, the problem for all of us in leadership  , in government, is obvious, there are always other pressing priorities 
(salinity, roads, infrastructure et cetera). Just in passing, Australia 
spends around $12 billion on defence and around $60 billion on health 
and welfare.

Â

This increasing awareness of defence could not be more timely because 
like you, we have “block obsolescence” that threatens the very existence 
of some of our defence capability.

Â

This increased awareness has been assisted by the extensive media 
coverage of:

Â

East Timor

Â

Problems in the whole Indonesian archipelago

Â

West Papua

Â

Increasing awareness of Chinese interest in the South China Sea

Â

The increasing number of boat people coming to Northern Australia

Â

And generally, the “arc of instability” that New Zealand and Australia 
share….Fiji, the Solomans, and Bougainville.

Â

Reports of New Zealand downgrading capability are also given high 
levels of publicity: -

Â

your Orion decision

Â

Helen Clark’s comments on your East Timor commitment

Â

On sustainability

Â

Comparative pay rates

Â

And reports of purported defections to our ranks.

Â

These have been all been subject to high media 
coverage (in the same way the Lange Government decisions on nuclear 
ship visits and the ANZUS breakdown did a decade ago).

Â

In the last couple of years, not a State or 
Federal conference of our major politica  l parties (National, Liberal or even Labor) has gone past without 
a call for increased defence funding, possibly for the reintroduction 
of National Service, and certainly, more money for cadets.

Â

These matters I know are relative and I wouldn’t like you to think 
the defence debate is all sweetness and light, but Australia seems in 
addition to what I’ve said - to be on a “commemorative wave”.

Â

Anzac Day - 25  th  of April - is getting bigger every 
year (new memorials at Anzac Cove), Remembrance Day which had nearly 
withered in the 70s is now bigger every year.

Â

I think the fathers of my generation didn’t want to talk of the 
war to their children - as grandparents, sanitised perhaps by time, 
they feel much more comfortable talking of their military experience 
to their grandchildren. This has aided the current interest in military 
history and the Government’s commitment to foster that interest:-

Â

1995 - Australia Remembers

Â

1996 - “Their Service, Our Heritage”

Â

new war memorials worldwide. Much money has been spent on commemoration 
in little towns across the nation

Â

the local Light Horse Association on the 31  st  of the 10  th , 
1916 in the Battle of Beersheba

Â

I was involved in the Senate inquiry into the loss of HMAS Sydney 
in November 1940 - all hands lost x643. Fifty-nine years after the 
loss there were over 600 submissionsÂ Â Â
