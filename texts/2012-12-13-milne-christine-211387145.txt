Thursday 13 December 2012  Carr must be “friend to” Sri Lanka  The Greens are urging Foreign Minister Bob Carr to be ”a friend to” Sri Lanka on his visit there, in the same way that he has repeatedly said that to be a friend of Israel means sometimes telling them when they have “got it wrong”.  “Senator Carr is absolutely right that being a friend to another country means telling them when we believe they have got it wrong, and I urge him to apply that on his visit to Sri Lanka and raise with the leaders he meets human rights abuses and treatment of asylum seekers we have deported back to the country,” Australian Greens Leader, Senator Christine Milne, said.  Last month, Australian diplomats representing the Australian Government at the United Nations raised their concerns with the UN Human Rights Council about ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, including persistent discrimination, torture, disappearances and abductions.   “Submissions to the UN Human Rights Council from international and Sri Lankan human rights organisations have documented the continued extrajudicial killings by military operatives, suspicious deaths in police custody, disappearances by paramilitary groups, white van abductions, torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests and detention of alleged members of armed groups, their family members and colleagues, as well as outspoken critics and perceived political opponents of the Government, including journalists.   “It is time for the Government to explain how our diplomats in Geneva can condemn human rights abuses in Sri Lanka, while our bureaucrats in Canberra can send asylum seekers back to this very violence and persecution they are fleeing.”  Amidst alarming reports from refugee rights advocates that the Immigration department has not properly assessed asylum seeker claims and has not granted them due appeal as per our legal obligations, The Greens are deeply concerned about the safety of many of the people the Australian Government has deported to Sri Lanka.  “I have raised concerns with Minister Carr about these human rights abuses and have asked the Minister how the Government can guarantee the safety of returned asylum seekers. I have also raised with the Minister my concerns about the level of engagement between the Sri Lankan navy and the Australian Federal Police in the disruption and interception of asylum seeker vessels.  “In the face of this evidence I call on the Minister to address these concerns with the Sri Lankan Government, and apply the proper process for assessing asylum seeker claims in Australia.”   Contact Alexandra Lamb on 0437 587 562
