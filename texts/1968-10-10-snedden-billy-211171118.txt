FROM THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION

PRESS STATEMENT BY THE TÂ°L INISTER FOR IKMIGRATION,

THE HON. B. W. SII DDEN, Q.C., M.P.

The first Turkish workers and families to come to

Australia under the new agreement with Turkey would arrive in Sydney on October 14, the Minister for Immigration,

Mr. Snedden, said today.

A Qantas ch=,rter plane with 164 Turks would arrive from

Ankara at 5.5 p.m.

The second charter flight was due on November 14.

"The arrival of the first group of Turkish people to travel to Australia under arrangements made with the Turkish Government marks the widening scope of our drive for new settlers" said Mr. Snedden.

"I am confident that they will be good citizens and make a valuable contribution to our community.

"Unlike most of our other new settlers, the Turks

will not find here a large community of their own people

to assist them in the settlement difficulties which they will encounter.

"As the Turks become established in the Australian

community as an ethnic group many of their settlement Ã¢ÂÂ¢ problems will be solved. Individually, they must strive as quickly as possible to improve their knowledge of English.

Free tuition in English will be available to them, just as it is to all other non—English speaking migrants.

also its fullest co-operation,,.

When the first plane loud of Turks arrives in Sydney on Monday next they will be welcomed by the Minister for Housing, Dame Annabelle Rankin, the Turkish Ambassador,

Mr. B. V. Karatay, and representatives of the Good Neighbour

Movement and the R.S.L..
