M 105/86 Minister for Education

1 July 1986

NEW YOUNG HOMELESS ALLOWANCE FOR STUDENTS

The Commonwealth Government has introduced a new allowance to help young  people stay in education if they have no family home or parental support.

The Commonwealth Education Minister, Senator Susan Ryan, who announced  this today, said the Young Homeless Allowance Scheme begins on  1 July 1986 and provides up to $73.28 a week to eligible secondary and  tertiary students.

"We have introduced the Young Homeless Allowance to ensure that young  people in great need who are without parental or custodial support can  continue in education," Senator Ryan said.

"The allowance is a further plank in the Priority One Strategy to  establish a youth income support system to encourage and enable young  people to participate in education and training."  /

Strict eligibility criteria will apply to ensure that only those with  genuine needs receive the benefit, Senator Ryan said. Where appropriate,  students will be asked to provide evidence of their family circumstances  from people such as student counsellors, doctors or police officers.

Students likely to qualify for assistance are those with no parental  home; such as orphans, wards and refugees without parents in Australia;  and students whose family circumstances make it unreasonable to expect  them to live at home.

"In an ideal situation young people remain at school and live with their  parents", Senator Ryan said. "The facts are that for a variety of  reasons some young people are forced out of the family home and can end  up on the streets.

"Young people finding themselves in this unfortunate situation should not  also be denied any chance of completing their education."

The maximum Commonwealth assistance Year 11 and 12 secondary students can  get at present is $35 a week under the Secondary Allowances Scheme.

From 1 July 1986 the Commonwealth Government will introduce a Young Homeless  Allowance-to assist young people who are homeless and without parental or  custodial support. Ã¢Â‘ :  . '

. . This allowance will be paid by the Commonwealth Department of  Education to hom ~eless full-time stttdents-fr"Of'Tit~ end of'compulsory schooling. It will  be p01d by the Commonwealth Department of Social Sec ~rity to homeless  unemployed beneficiaries, aged 16 and 17 years. . . . ;: 7 >'>.l'Je~iil~ifi~fi:'[~~~,~-

The Young Homeless Allowance will equal the maxim ...... -...... ,..  tertiary education allowance of $13.28 a week. Ã¢Â‘ 'Â¢Â£~~~~&~~

YOUNG HOMELESS ALLOWANCE

FOR STUDENTS

WHO IS ELIGIBLE?

1. Wards of the Commonwealth  2. Refugees whose parents are not living in  Australia  3. Homeless students.

To qualify for this allowance students must be

able to prove that they have not been living in the  family home for at least six weeks because:

" there is no family home at which their parents  are prepared to let them live;   " it would be unreasonable to expect the student  to return home because of domestic violence,

incestuous harassment or other such exceptionÃ¢Â‘  al circumstances.  In addition:   " the parents do not, and will not contribute,

either directly or indirectly, to the student's  support;   " the student is not being supported by other  adults acting as guardians on a long-term

basis; and   " the student is not receiving, on a long-term  basis, any payment from a government  department other than an education allowance

from the Commonwealth Department of  Education.

EVIDENCE REQUIRED

A homeless student will be required to provide as  much of the following evidence as possible to  support a claim for an allowance:

" a statutory declaration outlining family  circumstances;   " statutory declarations and/or reports from at  least two persons such as a school principal,

counsellor, a social worker, a minister of  religion, a member of the police force or a  doctor who are familiar with the circumstances  and family background. Declarations should  relate to the eligibility conditions set out above .

REVIEW OF THE ALLOWANCE

Students who are granted the allowance as  refugees or homeless students will be sent a form  every twelve weeks to make sure they are still  eligible to receive payments .

PAYMENTS

The first payment will be sent as soon as possible  after the entitlement has been assessed . SubseÃ¢Â‘  quent payments will follow at four weekly interÃ¢Â‘  vals. Payments will be made to a:

" bank account;   " credit union account; or   " building society account.

Students who do not have one of these accounts  should open one .

TERTIARY STUDENTS

Tertiary students who apply for the Young  Homeless Allowance must also meet the eligibility  requirements for the Tertiary Education Allowance  Scheme.

SECONDARY STUDENTS

In general students should have been aged under  19 years at 1 January 1986.

The age limit may be extended by one year in  any case where the student's progress has been  delayed by special circumstances such as illness ,  English language difficulties, transfer from a  different education system, periods of employ " ment or training or redirection of studies. Other  special circumstances will be looked at sym " pathetically.

Secondary students, aged 19 as at 1 January  1986, must in general meet the eligibility requireÃ¢Â‘  ments for the Adult Secondary Education  As sistance Scheme.

YOUNG HOMELESS ALLOWANCE

FOR UNEMPLOYED ~

ELIGIBILITY

The allowance is designed to assist unemployed,  homeless 16 and 17 year-olds. However , if  someone is under 16 and on special benefit,  Social Security will pay them the Young Homeless  Allowance if they meet the homeless criteria .

In order to qualify for the allowance the claimant

must be able to show: he or she has not been  living in the family home for at least the previous  six weeks because :

" there is no family home or   " parents will not let the young person live with  them or   " it would be unreasonable to require the young

person to return home because of domestic  violence, incestuous harassment or other  exceptional circumstances and   " the parents do not and will not contribute to

the support of the young person and   " the young person is not being supported by an  adult or adults acting as a guardian on a long " term basis and   " the young person wou ld not be receiving any

form of Commonwealth and/or State income  support on a continuing basis.

The se points may need to be verified by police,  from medical records, from reports from counsel " lors, or from records from hostels and refuges. It  will not always be necessary to interview parents.

WHAT IS THE  YOUNG HOMELESS  ALLOWANCE?

Th is allowance is paid in add iti on to unemploy "

ment, special and sickness benefits. It is designed  to bring the benefit amount up to the maximum  rate of TEAS.

At this stage that amount is $73.28 per week .

YHA rates will increase each year from 1 January  1988 , in line with rises in TEAS.

EFFECT OF INCOME ON

THE BENEFIT AND  ALLOWANCE

The unemployment benefit income test will apply  to the benefit and allowance as a combined  amount.

A beneficiary may earn a total of $30 .00 a week  before income affects their benefit. After $30.00,  benefit will be reduced by 50Â¢ for every dollar  earned up to $70.00. After $70.00 the benefit will  be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis.

The allowa nce is taxable. Ho~ever , a person  who receives benefit plus YHA for a full financial  year would not have a tax liability unless he or  she has some other income in that year.

EXTRA INFORMATION

The allowance will be reviewed every 12 weeks  to see if the young person's circumstances have  changed in any way.

Rent assistance will not be paid.

Normal proof of identity procedures w ill apply,  i.e. the person will be required to show birth  certificate, passport or other identificatio n along  with something like driver's licence, bank book,  reference from schoo l, etc.
