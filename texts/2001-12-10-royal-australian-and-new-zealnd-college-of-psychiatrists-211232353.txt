PSYCHIATRISTS: 
CHILDREN IN DETENTION CAN'T WAIT 12 MONTHS

Â

The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 
today reiterated its call for an   urgent  assessment of the 
mental and physical health needs of detained asylum-seekers.

Â

"The announcement of an inquiry by the Human 
Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission over the next twelve months 
is a positive development but children in detention need help   now ," Dr Louise Newman, 
Chair of the Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the Royal 
Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists said.

Â

"Twelve months in the life of a child is tremendously 
significant. Without access to appropriate mental and physical health 
care, the problems experienced in childhood can only magnify in later 
life. At this point, any delay is unacceptable," Dr Newman said.

Â

"We are particularly concerned about the children, 
some of whom are born in detention, for their subsequent emotional development 
and for the effects of detention on the functioning of their families."

Â

Dr Newman said that medical professionals need to 
seriously consider the ethical implications of accepting a position 
in the detention centres run by Australasian Correctional Management 
given the inadequacy of health services available to detained asylum-seekers 
inside these centres.

Â

"As doctors, we cannot condone a system that 
is traumatising and damaging to people."

Â

"We are being placed in an extremely compromising 
position."

Â

"We are certainly not 
advocating a withdrawal of medical services to detention centres. We 
are taking this opportunity to draw attention to the seriousness of 
the situation we face."
