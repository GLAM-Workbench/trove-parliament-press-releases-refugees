AID COUNCIL WELCOMES MAINTENANCE OF OVERSEAS AID BUDGET  BUT AUSTRALIA STILL FALLING BEHIND

The  Australian  Council  for  Overseas  Aid  (ACFOA)  has  welcomed  the  maintenance  of Australia’s overseas aid  budget at the same real levels for 2002/3, but cautions that it will not be enough to prevent Australia from falling  behind in the international fight against poverty.

“In particular, ACFOA welcomes the announcement of an additional $18m in debt relief over three years under  the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Countries  (HIPC)  Initiative  to  relieve  the  world’s  poorest  countries  of  unsustainable  debt” said Mr Graham Tupper, ACFOA Executive Director.

Other  positive  outcomes  for  overseas  aid in the current budget include the allocation of an extra $40 million in  country  and  global  programs  in  the  aid  budget  to  maintain  in  real  terms  the  level  of  expenditure  on  poverty  reduction programs in Asia and the Pacific.

“By the Government’s own admission, however, in the last financial year Australia has fallen from 12 to 14 out  of  22  countries  on  the  OECD  aid  donor  list  and  unless  action  is  taken  to  reverse  this  trend  Australia  will  fall  further to near the bottom of the OECD aid donor list by 200 6.  (Refer Table 1 attached) This is part of a long -term  decline  in  Australia’s  aid  underway  for  nearly  30  years  from  its  high  point  of  0.5%  of  GNP  in  the  early  seventies. (Refer Table 2 attached).

“It is difficult to determine from the budget papers exac tly how much of the announced $90 million increase in the  level of Official Development Assistance (ODA) is for programs focussed on poverty reduction and how much is  attributable to aid related costs of other government departments,” said ACFOA Executive Director, Mr Tupper.

Of the total $1.8 billion aid budget figure for 2002/3 the aid budget papers indicate that $143m is attributable to  ODA eligible activities of other government departments and of this ACFOA understands that $116m is for the  estimated  costs  of  processing  asylum  seekers  in  the  Pacific  incurred  by  the  Department  of  Immigration  and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA).

“It would have been preferable for all of the $90m announced increase in official development assistance (ODA)  to have been allocated to poverty reduction programs instead of mixing in some of the costs for the processing of  asylum seekers as part of the so called Pacific Solution. However, the aid budget does include a new $15m special  international  refugee  allocat ion and a welcome increase in funds for emergency aid to help address the needs of  people displaced by natural disasters and conflicts.”

e graph directly above uses projections based on the commitments and statements by the US, the UK, the European  Union, Portugal, Ireland, Canada and NZ. It assumes no change in Australia’s policy.

Australia now ranks 12th our of  22 OECD donor countries.   It gives about one third of the  internationally agreed targets.

Australia is likely to rank  20th our of 22 OECD donor  countries by 2006 unless a  commitment is made to  increase our aid levels.
