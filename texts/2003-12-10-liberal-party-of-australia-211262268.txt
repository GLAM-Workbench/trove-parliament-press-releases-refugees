Item: ATTORNEY-GENERAL PHILIP RUDDOCK CONFIRMS ASIO HAS  USED ITS NEW POWERS TO INTERROGATE AUSTRALIAN  ASSOCIATES OF FRENCH TERROR SUSPECT WILLIE BRIGITTE..

INTERVIEWEES: PHILIP RUDDOCK, ATTORNEY GENERAL





ATTORNEY-GENERAL PHILIP RUDDOCK: I understand there were some  matters you wanted to talk about, so I’ll let you make  the running.

QUESTION: What’s the progress on the ASIO interrogations of the  associates of Willie Brigitte?

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Well,  I’m  not  able  to  give  a  running  commentary  in   relation  to  operational  issues  involving  security   agencies.   The  simple  point  I  have  made  -  and  it  was   made last week in the Senate, but not observed,  I think  - Chris Ellison I think in answering a question made it  clear that the agency had used the questioning powers.

It’s  part  of  the  questioning  regime,  but  it’s  the

questioning powers that have been used.  Nobody has

been detained.  And it is part of an ongoing inquiry in  which  the  issues  raised  by  the  Director-General  of   ASIO about the concern we had that Mr Brigitte came  to  Australia  with  the  intention  of  occasioning  some   harm to Australia and possibly Australians, was - was  raised.

And of course, obviously in relation to a matter of that

sort,  it’s  important  to  explore  all  of  the  -  all  of  the   potential options in terms of what he may have had in  mind, and what people he’s associated with may have  been involved in, and that’s what we’re seeking to do.   And  it’s  a  -  very  much  a  live  investigation.   It’s  a   matter  in  which  the  issues  are  of  concern.   But   regrettably I can’t give a day-to-day commentary.  Nor  should I.

QUESTION: Do we know any more about what he was planning to  do when he was here in Australia?

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Well,  obviously  we  -  agencies  may  have  information   that  they’ve  received  as  part  of  their  inquiries.   And   their  inquiries  would  not  be  ongoing  inquiries  if  we   believe  that  all  that  we  could  ascertain  had  been   ascertained.   I  mean,  the  greater  danger  in  relation  to   these - these matters is of course what you don’t know.   I  mean,  that’s  -  that’s  the  greater  concern.  What  we   have sought to do.

QUESTION: Can you tell us how many people have been questioned  at this stage?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: I’ve said the powers have been used.

QUESTION:  Have  ASIO  encountered any problems of limitations in  exercising the powers?



2

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Well,  obviously  legislation  that  was  dealt  with  last   week  arose  from  our  consideration  about  how  we   might  use  the  powers,  and  our  experience.   And  the  -   the  several  issues  were  relevant.   The  need  for   additional  time  if  you  had  to  use  interpreters  was   something  that  was  obviously  thought  about  in  the   context  of  Brigitte  that  may  or  may  not  have  been   relevant in relation to any - any other examinations that  occurred.

The  issues  in  relation  to  whether  or  not  a  prescribed

authority  might  be  able  to  give  some  direction  was   obviously an issue that we thought about in the context  of  having  to  implement  the  regime.   The  issues  about   how  operations  might  be  compromised  by  the   disclosure of information which could reveal what you  may be looking at also became very obvious, and - and  a  matter  of  concern.   And  they  arose  out  of  our   consideration  as  to  how  we  were  going  to  use  the   powers,  and  perhaps  in  some  instances  the  actual   operations.

QUESTION:  Isn’t  it  becoming  clearer,  Minister,  now,  that  these   powers  even  in  their  previous  form  should  have  been   used against Mr Brigitte himself?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: No.  The decision that was taken then was the - was the  correct  decision.   It  was  a  decision  in  the  context  of   who  would  be  privy  to  the  most  intelligence

information  that  might  need  to  be  used  in  any   discussions or questioning, and who was best placed to  be  able  to,  in  the  questioning  environment  that  they   had,  to  use  that  to  advantage,  and  the  professional   judgement  was  formed  by  ASIO  was  that  the  French   would have been better placed than we were, and that



3

was  quite  clear  in  the  initial  comments  I  made.   That   view hasn’t changed.

QUESTION: Minister, have any charges been laid so far, and do you  expect any charges to be laid from these inquiries?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Intelligence operations  are  designed  to  elicit   information  for  the  purposes  of  protecting  the   Australian  community.   There  are  separate  functions   that  are  pursued  by  the  police,  both  state  and  Federal   police, in any - in any matters that they’re involved in.   And those - those matters are with a view to obtaining  evidence  in  relation  to  the  commission  of  possible   offences.

And  again,  they’re  operational  issues.   I  think  it  -  I

think it became known from some news reports that it  was  possible  that  Australian  Federal  Police  wanted  to   question  some  people.   Their  questioning  is  in  a   different regime for a different purpose, and it follows  the  -  the  intelligence  task.   It’s  not  designed  to   compromise it.  But the procedures are very different,  because  you  have  to  look  to  obtain  evidence  about   offences where you have to meet rules of evidence.

QUESTION:  You  say  there  have  been  no  charges  laid  against

associates of Brigitte?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: I beg your pardon?

QUESTION: You’re saying there have been no charges laid against  any associates …

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  No,  I’ve  said  I’m  not  commenting  on  whether  there   have  been  charges,  and  I’m  not  going  to  comment  on



4

the  charges.   They’re  matters  about  which  -  about   which  it’s  important  to  allow  the  legal  system  to   operate,  and  people  to  be  able  to  have  certain

presumptions and so on.  It’s not a matter about which  I can give a day-to-day commentary either.

QUESTION: Have any traces of explosives … [indistinct]

QUESTION:  [inaudible]

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Excuse me, I will take the gentleman over here first.

QUESTION:  Would  you  describe  those  who’ve  been  questioned  as   members of a cell?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: No, I’ve merely said the powers have been used in the  context  of  this  investigation.   That’s  what  I’ve  said.    And I am not going to comment in any further detail. It  -  it  -  I  mean,  look,  the  more  detail  I  give,  the  more   terminology  I  use,  the  greater  the  potential  for   undermining  the  activities  in  which  the  agencies  are   involved, so I’m not going to do that, but the question  as to - as to confirmation that the powers had been used  was  a  matter  we  thought  very  seriously  about,  and  it   was  considered  last  week  appropriate  that  that  advice   should be given to the Parliament, and I’ve confirmed  it again now. But that’s really all I intend to do.  And  you had a question?

QUESTION:  Sorry,  the  -  have  any  traces  of  explosives  or  weapons   been found?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Well, again, what people are seeking to do is put to me  various  matters  of  speculation  that  have  appeared  in   some  cases  in  foreign  publications,  and  ask  me  to



5

confirm or deny those matters.  I’ve got no intention in  relation  to  ongoing  investigations  to  confirm  or  deny   any  of  the  suggestions  that  are  about,  save  to  say  that   some of it is clearly speculation.

QUESTION:  Can  you  confirm  the  report  in  The  Australian  today   that  Federal  Police  have  been  investigating  a  training   camp in the Blue Mountains for the past two years?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Look, there have …

QUESTION: Run by Jemaah Islamiyah?

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  No,  there  have  been  -  and  I  think  it’s  been  again   publicly  known  -  that  some  people  were  involved  in   activities which have been the subject of inquiries, and  those  activities  have  occurred  both  here  and  abroad.    There  may  be  some  qualitative  differences  in  relation   to  the  nature  of  the  training  that’s  occurred,  but  I’m  -   I’m  not  in  a  position  to  say  anything  more  than  that  -   that  there  are  matters  that  have  been  the  subject  of   ongoing inquiries.

QUESTION: In relation to a Blue Mountains training camp, do you  know?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: In relation to information that we have received about  allegations of training.  We have confirmed that some  people  have  trained  abroad.   We  have  not  given   particulars of the numbers of people involved, or who  those  people  are,  but  you’re  aware  from  the  ASIO   annual report that that information was included in the  report.



6

It is also a matter of knowledge that some inquiries are

undertaken in relation to activities here.  I said to you a  moment  ago  I  think  there’s  a  qualitative  difference   about what has happened here, and how you’d describe  it, really I wouldn’t like to go into, but the fact is I’m  not  in  a  position  to  confirm  or  deny  that  particular   individuals  have  participated  in  particular  activities.  I   am  in  a  position  to  say  that  there  have  been  ongoing   inquiries  in  relation  to  those  activities,  which  have   occurred here in Australia.

QUESTION:  Minister,  is  it  enough  evidence  now  to  charge  Willie   Brigitte  with  any  offence  in  Australia,  and  are  you   confident that if that evidence is there now, or emerges  later,  you’ll  be  able  to  bring  him  back  to  face  an   Australian court?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Well, I’m confident that under the mutual co-operation  in criminal matters that we have with France, that if the  charges were to be laid, extradition would be possible.   I’m confident of that.  But in relation to whether or not  there  is  evidence  sufficient  for  charges,  I  can’t   comment  on  that.  It’s  a  matter  in  which  there  are   ongoing inquiries, and I can’t say any more than that.

QUESTION: The ASIO interrogation of the Brigitte associates, was  the  timing  of  that  dictated  with  the  passage  of  the   ASIO law changes in the Parliament?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: No.   I’ll try that again.  No.

[laughter]

QUESTION: And is all questioning in Sydney, or is it spread further  afield?



7

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Look,  I  don’t  intend  to  go  into  any  more  details  than   what  I’ve  given  you  in  relation  to  that.   Look,  what  I   will  do  is  take  the  opportunity  to  discuss  some  other   matters  relating  to  border  security  and  comments  in   relation to security generally.

I  notice  the  Labor  Party  are  trying  to  at  the  moment

justify  the  decisions  that  they’ve  taken  to  add  another   further  layer  to  the  numbers  of  people  who  are   involved  in  administration  of  various  elements  of   public  policy,  which  have  security  matters  associated   with them.

You’ve  got  my  friend,  Robert  McClelland,  who  now

assumes a title, I think, of Shadow Minister for Home  Security  -  I  don’t  think  his  role  is  substantially   different  from  that  which  John  Faulkner  was   conducting  previously  when  he  had  responsibility  for   home  affairs  but  that  seems  to  have  escaped  the   attention of many who’ve commented on that issue to  date.

But  what  I  do  notice  is  that  in  addition  to  having  an

Attorney-General,  a  Minister  for  Immigration,   somebody  else  handling  customs  -  all  the  areas  in   which  there  are  linkages,  and  there  clearly  are,  where   you need to be able to work together - the Government  has appropriate arrangements in place for that to occur.   The  Opposition  has  added  to  the  number  of  layers,   including a Parliamentary Secretary in addition.

And  I  notice  that  they  are  also  continuing  with  their

confusion  about  -  about  how  you  deal  with  border   security.  I notice Mr McClelland today was saying the  terrorists  don’t  come  by  boats  and  make  asylum   claims,  but  terrorists  can  still  come  by  boats.   I  don’t



8

know  how  he  -  how  he  draws  that  distinction,  unless   he’s  saying  that  -  that  he  has  some  information  that   terrorists  have  reached  Australia  unlawfully  and  are   still here, and came by boat, and we haven’t identified  and located them.

I  would  hope  that  if  he  has  that  knowledge  he  would

bring  it  -  he  would  bring  it  forward.   But  I  notice  his   leader  continues  to  want  to  suggest  that  you  can  have   strong  border  protection  when  you’re  knocking  out   significant legs of public policy.  We’re now down to  two  of  the  four  legs  of  public  policy  having  been   removed.

He makes it very clear that excision is something that

he  doesn’t  agree  with.   He  persists  in  putting  this   mythical  argument  that  excising  areas  from  the   migration  zone  suggests  that  in  some  way  we’re   abandoning  sovereignty.   It’s  an  exercise  of

sovereignty, it’s not an abandonment of sovereignty.

And he has confirmed that - that it’s Labor’s policy to

unwind mandatory detention.  He says look, we’ll keep  it  for  limited  purposes,  but  if  people  are  presumably   able to continue using the system, and particularly the  courts,  where  the  matters  are  outside  the  hands  of  the   government  of  the  day  as  to  how  long  they  take,  he’s   saying  if  it’s  not  dealt  with  within  90  days,  we’ll   release  people.  I  mean,  that’s  essentially  what  he’s   saying.   We’ll  have  a  time  limit.   It  is  certainly  not  a   time limit in relation to processing because everybody  who is detained has been processed.  I mean, that’s the  one point I’d make.

If  it’s  a  question  of  getting  90  per  cent  of  processing

done  within  90  days,  that  happens  now.   The  reason



9

that  people  remain  in  detention  for  beyond  90  days  is   because  they  seek  to  use  the  legal  system  to  remain   there.   I  hope  that  when  we  come  forward  with  the   results  of  the  review  of  the  legal  regime  that  is   presently being undertaken by Hilary Penfold, and we  hope to have a report on that - in the early new year -  that we will get co-operation from Labor in relation to  reforms proposed, particularly in relation to the judicial  system.

I  hope  we  don’t  experience  the  same  sort  of

obstructionism  that  we  saw  before  the  last  election,   when Labor waited until - until an election was almost  due  before  they  supported  the  measures  that  we   intended to implement.

QUESTION: The other point of differentiation is the - the detention  of children.  Why is it appropriate for the Government  to hold children behind razor wire, as Labor says?

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Well,  the  one  thing  that  they’ve  actually  seemed  to   have  forgotten  about  is  the  -  is  the  principal  -  the   principal issue that was addressed in the Convention on  the Rights of the Child, and that was what is in the best  interests of children.  And the general view is that it is  in  the  best  interests  of  children  to  remain  with  their   parents.

So if you are persisting with a view that you’re going

to  release  children  and  only  children,  you  are  saying   that  it’s  your  policy  to  separate  them  from  their   families.   That’s  what  you’re  saying.   Now  I  haven’t   heard them say that.  In fact, when that proposition is  put to them, what I’ve heard them say is oh, look, we’d  release  the  whole  family.   And  of  course,  once  you   reach  that  point,  which  they  don’t  want  you  to  focus



10

on,  once  you  reach  that  point,  you’ve  essentially   abandoned mandatory detention.

QUESTION: But what’s wrong with that? Like, countries all around  the  world  -  Germany  has  a  hundred  thousand  asylum   seekers, and they don’t jail them?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Mm.  Now, that’s right, isn’t it.

QUESTION: Well tell me what is the problem-- …

PHILIP RUDDOCK: What's - what's …

QUESTION:  …with  releasing  them into the community?

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  What’s  -  because  it  feeds  the  perception  that  your   borders  are  open.   It  puts  people  on  boats  where  they   lose their lives.  And we’ve determined some time ago  that we intend to ensure that people who want to come  to Australia come the right way. They apply and seek  to  come  through  the  front  door  and  not  through  the   back door.

And yes, we could go the same way as Germany, and

have a hundred thousand …

QUESTION: And most other countries.

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Well,  most  other  countries  don’t  have  those  sorts  of   numbers.  It’s  Britain  -  Britain  has  about  ninety   thousand …

QUESTION:  No,  but  they  don’t  have  mandatory  detention  for

asylum seekers.



11

PHILIP RUDDOCK: And you know,  some  of  those  countries  that  want  to   address  those  issues  are  asking  themselves  from  time   to  time  whether  they  need  to  follow  a  range  of  the   measures that we have, in fact, implemented and if you  follow the debates in the United Kingdom closely you  would see that the main reason why they have not tried  to  implement  a  detention  regime  of  the  way  in  which   we have operated it is because the numbers are so large  that  it  would  not  be  a  practical  solution  for  them  to   pursue.

In other words, if you allow your border protection to

unravel  and  the  numbers  go  up,  mandatory  detention   becomes  a  policy  that  is  less  able  to  achieve  its   objectives  simply  because  of  the  numbers  that  you’ve   got to detain.

QUESTION:  But  how  does  punishing  the  children  for  the  sins  of   their parents …

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  It’s  not  a  question  of  punishment,  and  I  think  it’s  a   question  of  focussing  on  how  you  achieve  humane   detention  in  an  environment  in  which  your  broader   objective  is  being  pursued,  and  the  fact  is  most   children  in  -  in  detention  managed  in  the  schooling   system  where  they  were  able  to  participate  in  school   programs.  There are a range of outings in which they  participate.

We  now  have  alternative  detention  arrangements  in

place in Port Hedland, as well as Port Augusta.  And -  and if families are willing for a mother and children to  enter into the residential housing models, they can, and  we have - we now have much more accommodation for  that to occur.



12

So  I  mean,  it  is  not  an  inhumane  regime.   And  to

characterise  it  that  way  I  think  totally  misrepresents   what is happening.

QUESTION:  Attorney,  what’s  your  reaction  to  the  High  Court’s   decision  yesterday  that  could  allow  people  to  claim   asylum in Australia on the basis of sexual orientation?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Well, I’ll leave that to my colleague Amanda Vanstone  to comment on.  I mean, the - the legislation is within  her area of responsibility.  I simply observe that here in  Australia  the  High  Court  is  the  final  court  of  appeal.    We have a - we have a system in which in addition to  the  treaty,  there  is  a  capacity  for  jurisprudence,  and   what you’ve seen is how sometimes the jurisprudence  extends  the  convention  beyond  perhaps  the  way  it’s   been  interpreted  before,  and  sometimes  beyond  the   way it’s been interpreted by other countries.

QUESTION: Is this - is that some of the jurisprudence you’d like to  cut down with your review on courts and what matters  they can …

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Look,  I  don’t  have  a  view  on  those  matters.   As   Minister  -  as  Attorney-General,  it’s  a  matter  for  the  -   it’s  a  matter  for  the  Minister  for  Immigration  to   comment  on.   I  simply  say  that’s  the  way  our  system   operates.  What we’re looking at is whether there are a  range  of  issues  in  relation  to  the  very  substantial   number  of  non-meritorious  claims  that  are  brought   before  the  courts,  that  we  can  -  that  we  can  contain   that.

And  what  we’re  seeking  to  do  is  to  involve  all  of  the

practitioners,  as  well  as  some  of  those  who  have  to   operate the system, and considering the extent to which



13

our  -  our  opportunities  for  judicial  review,  which  last   year led to something like 5000 cases before the courts,  whether  they  are  being  utilised  in  ways  -  in  ways   which are not about getting a just outcome but, in fact,  are  seeking  to  have  people  remain  in  Australia  when   they  would  otherwise  have  been  removed,  and  there   are a range of issues that that inquiry is looking at, and  I  hope  we’ll  be  able  to  come  forward  with  some   positive  proposals,  and  I  hope  when  they  are  brought   forward, we’ll  have - we’ll have support for it.

I  don’t  think  we  can  go  on  with  having  more  than  50

per cent of the time of some courts totally involved in  hearing immigration appeals.

QUESTION:  Just  back  on  the  ATSIC  -  sorry  the  ASIO  laws,  has   Dennis  Richardson  briefed  you  on  how  effective  they   have  been  or  any  flaws  in  them  in  their  latest

application?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: There are a number of people who can - who can make  suggestions  as  to  the  way  in  which  the  law  might   operate.   ASIO  is  one.   And  those  urgent  matters  that   we had observed were addressed in the legislation that  was dealt with last week.  I made it clear then that we  have an open mind as to whether or not there are - are  other matters that might need to be addressed.

Some people were suggesting that because we’d acted

on  these  matters,  that  that  closed  the  door  to  any   further  reforms  that  might  emerge  from  -  from  our   experience.   I  just  simply  say  that  would  be  a  flawed   view.   There  have  been  a  number  of  sources

commenting  on  the  way  in  which  these  particular   powers  might  be  used,  as  you  would  expect,  and



14

arising from the broader consideration, I may well have  further amendments to bring forward in time.

QUESTION: Do you support Tony Abbott’s very personal attack on  Mark Latham last week?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: I think the Prime Minister had all that needed to be said  on that matter.

QUESTION: Do you intend to keep us regularly updated on the use  of  interrogation  and  detention  powers  as  you  -  as  you   and Senator Ellison are?

PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Well,  there  is  an  obligation  to  ensure  that  the   community  is  aware  of  those  matters,  and  there  are   reporting requirements.  So yes we …

QUESTION: Outside of the annual report?

PHILIP RUDDOCK: Well, let me  just  say  we  intend  to  ensure  that  people   are  informed  as  we  are  obliged  to  inform  them  in   accordance  with  law.   That’s  what  I’m  saying.    Whether  I’m  going  to  offer  a  running  commentary   depends  really  upon  the  operational  issues  and  the   advice  I  receive.   It’s  safe  to  assume  that  the  advice   I’ve  given  you  was  not  -  not  a  decision  of  my  own   making alone.  I consult in relation to whether or not,  given  the  operational  requirements,  that  information   will  hurt  or  hinder  what  we’re  doing,  and  the  advice   was it wouldn’t hurt in this instance. So - I mean, that’s  the background to it.  Okay.  Thanks very much.  And  as  I  said  before,  Happy  Christmas,  Happy  New  Year.    See you all again.
