SUBJECTS: Malaysia Solution vote

E&OE…

Christopher Pyne: Thank you very much for coming ladies and gentlemen and obviously this press conference  is about the government’s latest act of cowardice in not bringing the Migration Act to a vote today. The Prime  Minister has said on the 22nd of September, on no less than four occasions she accused the Coalition of running  scared on the Malaysia People Swap Deal and not wanting to have a vote. On the twenty second of September  on no more than three occasions this was a matter of great urgency and that they would expedite the Bill and  expedite the vote.

On the twentieth of September she said on four occasions that they would bring this legislation to the Parliament  and in fact she said in words that will ring in her ears, hopefully for which she will be held to account, Tony  Abbott and every member of the Liberal Party and every member of the National Party should walk into the  Parliament and have their vote recorded. They should record their vote name by name, person by person by  person. And yet today Anthony Albanese has gone back on his word which he said on the fourth of October. Mr  Albanese said he would proceed with the vote even though he expected it to be defeated in the Senate. So today  we have seen the latest act of cowardice from a government that lacks the courage of its conviction, a Prime  Minister that doesn’t have the integrity that a Prime Minister should have to stand by the statements that she has  made in the last few weeks.

If the Government had any integrity, if it was worth its salt it would have a vote on the Migration Bill today. They  are, the Labor Party are in the chamber right now as we speak adding speakers to the Work Health and Safety  Bill 2011 which Mr Albanese described to me yesterday as an uncontroversial Bill. They had no speakers listed on

that Bill today. It was to move quickly to a vote because Mr Albanese told me it needed to get into the Senate so  that it could be passed this year. Now apparently the Government is filibustering that vote till Question Time in  order to avoid having the Migration Bill even debated today, let alone voted on today. You look at the speakers  list for the Labor Party they had no names on it at all this morning for the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011, now  they have at least seven speakers listed to do that Bill in order to make sure there is no vote.

I’m calling on the government to have the courage of its convictions to face the Parliament, that the Parliament  judge the Malaysian people swap deal that the Prime Minister has said on so many occasions that she would.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: Well, the reason the Government is not even allowing the migration bill to be debated is because it  provides me with the opportunity to move a motion to put they are so frightened of the judgement of the  Parliament and so terrified that if they lose that vote they would need to call an election as happened in 1929  when Stanley Melbourne Bruce did the right thing and called an election.  They won’t even allow the migration  bill to come on for debate.  Now, of course there are tools at the disposal of the Opposition to act, but I won’t be  telegraphing those to the Press Gallery or the public just yet.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: We are very determined that the Government be kept to its promise that this bill would be voted on this  week and we’ll do whatever we can to ensure they keep that promise.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: We’ve talked about lots of matters.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: Not specifically on this migration bill.  I did speak to the Chief Government Whip who indicated in a very  haughty tone that the migration bill would not be voted on today.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: Well, Tony Crook has made the right decision.  He is not going to support a very bad policy which sends  asylum seekers to Malaysia without any protection when there are alternatives like the Opposition’s alternative of  opening the Nauru processing centre, reinstating temporary protection visas and turning back the votes where  possible.  He’s made the right decision.  The Government is in government.  They chose to negotiate their way  into government.  They have to have a policy on border protection.  Effectively what has now occurred that the  Government will now not have this bill voted on is that they have no policy protection whatsoever.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: This bill is sitting on the notice paper like a great dark shadow over the Government.  Like the Damocles  sword hanging over the fate of the Gillard-Rudd Government.  The reality is if they don’t vote on this today they

will not resolve this matter.  It will sit on the notice paper and can be raised at any time.  And a matter that  three weeks ago the Prime Minister said was urgent and that she wanted to make every Opposition member  come into the house and sit there and be recorded name by name is apparently non longer so important that it  can sit on the notice paper for another two weeks and may in fact never be dealt with.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: Well the government could immediately adopt the opposition’s policy of re-opening the Nauru processing  centre, bringing back Temporary Protection Visas, and turning back the boats where policy. Our policy, as in fact  Kevin Rudd said before the 2007 election, you would turn back the boats, was the quote when he was asked  about whether you could turn back boats and stop the people smuggling trade.

They could swallow their pride and do that; the Prime Minister could fess up to the fact that she and Kevin Rudd  changed the Howard Government’s policies on border protection and made a mess of it and failed the Australian  people in August 2008. The question is whether she’s big enough to do that, given the evidence so far that she’s  not even big enough to have a vote today on the migration bill, I wouldn’t be holding my breath.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: I think everybody is surprised at the government’s inept political handling on a daily basis, bringing in a  Bill and describing it as urgent, mocking the opposition, demanding we vote for it, insisting that there would be a  vote at the first opportunity, not having the numbers for that Bill, and then being too frightened to actually hold  the vote today, takes the incompetence of the government to a new level and I think the Australian public and  thoroughly sick of an incompetent, inept government that can’t get border protection right, that isn’t focussed on  cost of living pressures, interest rates, or how to ensure that they can reduce their taxes and see families,  instead they’re focussing on a carbon tax which will increase the cost of living and failed dismally to have a  border protection policy.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: Well, I’m not in the habit of talking about Coalition tactics to the press gallery so I’m not going to start  talking about them now.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: Well, you’ll have to find out.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: You’ll find out later today.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: I talk to the Clerk constantly.

Journalist: (inaudible)

Pyne: No, I’ve been around long enough to know what I have to do.
