MEDIA RELEASE



Free bridging visa E holders from limbo

Thursday June 30, 2005

It is time for the Howard Government to show compassion to asylum seekers on  bridging visas e by allowing them to support themselves while awaiting the outcomes of  their cases.

At present, most individuals on bridging visas E are unable to support themselves and  are forced to depend on various churches and charities.

The Howard Government has allowed this to go on for years.  I believe it is  fundamentally wrong for the Coalition to allow charitable organisations to subsidise its  own moral deficiencies.

The Government must lift the burden on society’s good Samaritans and overturn the 45-day rule that prevents bridging visa E holders from participating in the economy.

It seems terribly cruel to force these people into a limbo situation where they can live in  Australia but can’t work.

If they can’t work, they can’t feed or clothe themselves, or even pay for accommodation.   It’s even harder for those supporting a family.

And if anyone gets sick, an even greater strain is placed on the family because they are  denied access to Medicare.

Apart from being unjust, it is absurd to prevent people from working at a time when a  skills crisis is afflicting Australia.

If members of the Howard Government were serious about turning over a  compassionate new leaf, they would free asylum seekers on bridging visas E from this  limbo.

Background

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ There are approximately 8000 asylum seekers living in the community on bridging visas.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The rights and entitlements for asylum seekers depend on which bridging visa they hold and the  particular stage of their case. If an asylum seeker has lodged an application within 45 days from  the time of arrival and has not appealed beyond the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), he or she is  entitled to work rights and Medicare. If an initial decision has not been made within six months  and the RRT has not rejected the application, he or she may receive a federally funded Asylum  Seeker Assistance Scheme (ASAS) payment through the Australian Red Cross. However many  asylum seekers are not aware of the requirement to lodge an application within 45 days.  Consequently many fail to do so and are therefore deemed ineligible to receive work rights,  Medicare or any other welfare payments. This includes all asylum seekers awaiting a  humanitarian decision from the Immigration Minister and all asylum seekers released from  detention on a Bridging Visa E, including those released on psychological or medical grounds.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Asylum Seeker Project, Hotham Mission runs the Basic Living Assistance Program, which  provides asylum seekers with an average of $30 per person per week. It also provides assistance  for housing, medical and living emergencies and assistance with referrals to health, education,  recreation and legal services.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The project’s total emergency relief and housing budget is currently $30,000 per month, assisting  more than 200 asylum seekers in Victoria. Besides a $40,000 grant from the Ross Trust and  Sisters of Charity (for a total of 3 years) and $1,000 a month from St Marks Community Centre,  there are no regular funds going to the Basic Living Assistance Program. All remaining funds are  from community groups or individual donations.
