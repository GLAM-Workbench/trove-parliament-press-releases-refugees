DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - HILTON INTERNATIONAL, ADELAIDE

JOURNALIST:

\\That do you think of the government's health policy Mr Howard?

HOWARD:

I think it7s another exercise in catch-up politics. For 13 years we've been told that  we've had a rolled-gold, brilliant, unbelievable, unmatchable health policy, 48 hours  ago rebates for private health insurance were anathema. Something' s happened on the  road to Melbourne. He's had a DamascusNlike conversion to the cause of rebates for  private health insurance. I invite the Prime Minister to take other policies.

JOURNALIST:

Will it blunt the effect of your policy when it's announced?

HOWARD:

Nothing will blunt the effect of our policy. This is;;:~ remarkable and if the fine detail  bears out what I understand to be tbe situation, a fascinating exercise in catch-up  politics. I mean you cannot credibly denounce something as wrong and immoral and  anti the poor and gold-plated and all of those other things. And then 48 hours later  almost as a footnot~ or an afterthought after you've read some speculation in the press  about what might be in the Coalition's policy, then put as part of your policy  something that you have derided for almost a decade.

JOURNALIST;

Will it make it harder for people to choose between the two parties then?
