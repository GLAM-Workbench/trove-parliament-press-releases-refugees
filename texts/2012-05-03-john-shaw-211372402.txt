JOHN SHAW:

Good morning Tony, how are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not too bad John, but as you say, these are interesting times.

JOHN SHAW:

You’ve been in parliament for quite some time now. Have you ever gone into a budget session with a  government in so much disarray as what this one is?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the short answer is no and what’s pretty clear is that if the Treasurer announces a surplus next week it  will be based on cooked books. He’s taken a whole lot of spending off budget, such as the National  Broadband Network, and he’s engaging in a whole lot of budget fiddles - putting some spending into this  year, deferring some spending into the year after next - all a desperate attempts to produce a surplus on  paper, which I suspect will turn out not to be delivered, because this government is addicted to spending, it’s  addicted to taxing and that’s not the way to get a sustainable surplus.

JOHN SHAW:

Recent polls and I know you don’t take a lot of notice of opinion polls and, as far as you’re concerned, the  only poll that really matters is when we go to an election, but a survey conducted earlier this week by the  Daily Telegraph asking people whether or not they wanted an election, 93 percent of respondents said ‘yes’.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, that’s right John. Now I think there is a very strong national mood now for an election, because I  think people are sick of this hung parliament. I think they’re sick of the Labor/Green alliance. I think they’re

sick of a Prime Minister who says anything to secure her position and often does the opposite when it suits  her such as on the carbon tax. So, I think people are sick of this and you know the only people who are  really sustaining this Prime Minister and this government are in fact the two independents, Mr Windsor and  Mr Oakeshott, and I think that it’s high time that they did a lot more listening to their electorates.

JOHN SHAW:

Now, Tony Windsor said when he put Julia Gillard into power that he did that because he believed Labor  could deliver stability of government. Now, if this is stability of government, I’d like to see something that’s  not.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think even Tony Windsor must now accept that what he had hoped for has not eventuated, that this  has been an incompetent and untrustworthy government. Probably the most incompetent and untrustworthy  government in Australia’s history and I can understand Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor feeling  embarrassed that their judgment has turned out to be awry on this but I really think they should face facts  and just accept that they got it wrong and that it is time for this government to go.

JOHN SHAW:

People are talking about votes of no confidence in the government. Would the Opposition contemplate such  a move, knowing that I suppose it’s probably a waste of time, the fact that Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott  and firmly entrenched in the Labor camp?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think if their electorates let them know exactly what they think in no uncertain terms, robustly but politely,  it is even now possible that they might see sense but my position all along has been: I have no confidence in  the government, I’ve never had any confidence in this government, the Coalition has no confidence in this  government, but as long as Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott are welded onto Julia Gillard they’ve got to wear  the blame for this government. And as long as Mr Thomson, the member for Dobell now facing such serious  allegations, as long as he is in the parliament voting for the government, well, there’s not a lot of point  moving a no confidence motion and if the Prime Minister is fair dinkum about disassociating herself in the  stinking, wretched mess that is the Health Services Union, she wouldn’t just disown Craig Thomson, she’d  disown his vote in parliament but, oh now, we are not going to see that from this Prime Minister.

JOHN SHAW:

What have you ever done to Tony Windsor? Last week on the ABC news when asked about the schmozzle  in the government at the present time, he turned his attack on you and he called you a rabid dog and that you  had a mouth full of laxettes. How do you respond to something like that? I know you haven’t responded.  What do you think would prompt him to say something like that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think I can only respond with bemusement to something like that - I think John. I don’t know. My  dealings with Tony Windsor have always been civil. When I was a minister, if he ever asked me for some  help to the best of my ability I was ready to give it. In opposition I’ve always tried to be courteous and  constructive with him. I certainly think Mr Windsor never really had any intention of doing anything other  than keeping a Labor government in office after the last election, but, nevertheless, why he’s gone so over-the-top I just don’t know. Certainly there are some days when the only one who is out there defending the  indefensible when it comes to the conduct of this Prime Minister and this government is Tony Windsor.  JOHN SHAW:

The boats continue to arrive and now the government’s offering residents $300 to accommodate asylum  seekers. What do you think of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah. Look, I think a lot of Australians are staggered at the lengths to which the government is going to  really make people feel at home when they’ve come illegally - they haven’t been invited into the front door,  they’ve snuck in through the back window and I think people are feeling confused and angry at what this  government is doing. Now, there’s only one way to fix this and that’s to stop the boats, John, and the  Coalition stopped the boats under John Howard. There’s no secret as to the policies needed to stop the boats.  You’ve got to have temporary protection visas so that the people smugglers haven’t got a product to sell.  You’ve got to have rigorous offshore processing, preferably in a third world country, reopen Nauru in other  words, and you’ve got to be prepared to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so. John Howard did that. It  was very, very effective and the next Coalition government will do it because it’s very important to let the  people smugglers and their customers know that Australians won’t be played for mugs.

JOHN SHAW:

Talking about the next election, are you ready to go to an election?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think if the Labor Party is concerned that the Coalition is unready, well, put it to the test. Let’s have one!

JOHN SHAW:

Alright. Thanks Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

John, it’s great to talk to you, as always.

JOHN SHAW:

Thank you.
