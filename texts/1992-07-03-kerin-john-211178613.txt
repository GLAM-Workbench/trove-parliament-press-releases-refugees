Further Australian aid for victims of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia

Australia will provide an additional $200,000 to the United Nations to assist it to meet the humanitarian needs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and other areas of the former Yugoslavia, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

"Since September last year, Australia has provided $750,000 in emergency funds for the victims of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia," Mr Kerin said.

"As the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina continues, the UN plans for the reopening of Sarajevo airport gives an opportunity for the world community to help relieve the suffering.

"The UNHCR is coordinating what will be a massive airlift initially involving 175 relief flights to deliver essential supplies," he said.

Mr Kerin again stressed the Government's appeal for the parties to silence their weapons and engage in a political dialogue to end this terrible conflict.

"Australia will also play a part in international efforts to seek a peaceful solution to end the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Mr Kerin.

According to the latest UNHCR estimates there are nearly one and a half million refugees or displaced persons in the former Yugoslavia, with Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia the worst affected regions.

The assistance is provided through Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB.
