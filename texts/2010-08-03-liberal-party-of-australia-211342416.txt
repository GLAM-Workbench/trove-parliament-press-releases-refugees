Transcript: Deputy Prime Minister and  Treasurer, Geoff Hutchison, ABC720 Radio, Perth  Wayne Swan posted Tuesday, 3 August 2010

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        They are Western Australia's highest profile political leaders. One is Stephen

Smith, is the Australian Foreign Minister, the other Julie Bishop, Deputy Leader of the Federal Opposition

and the Shadow Foreign Minister. They play prominent roles on the big stage, they also represent us in

their electorates of Perth, of course, and Curtin here in WA. They have managed to find room in their

diaries to be here in the studio to talk to you and answer some questions.

1300 222 720. Make sure they're good ones. Julia Bishop, Stephen Smith, good morning to you both.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Good morning, Geoff.

JULIE BISHOP:        Good morning, Geoff.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Our first question for both of you, are you the real Julie Bishop? Are you the real

Stephen Smith?

JULIE BISHOP:        Well, I think this is an extraordinary admission on the part of Julia Gillard, that for the

last five weeks we've been seeing somebody other than the real Julia Gillard. I mean, Stephen, you're part

of the Labor machine, who on earth has been running this campaign if it hasn't been the Prime Minister

and who within Labor is so powerful that they can force a Prime Minister to mislead the Australian public

for the last five weeks of the campaign?

I just find this the most extraordinary admission on the part of Julia Gillard. But in answer to your

question, it's me. It's Julie Bishop.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        The real Stephen Smith, good morning.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, people have known me for a long time in my local constituency and nationally. But

that categorisation, of course, I reject. What Julia was saying, she enjoyed very much her campaigning

here. She wanted to make the point, she wanted to get out and about and make the campaign more

spontaneous and more real and more direct.

There's a very serious question about reality. Tony Abbott, we know is now being cloistered, ask these

questions about the real Tony Abbott. The real Tony Abbott now pretending that he doesn't want to

implement WorkChoices.

The real Tony Abbott saying that paid paternity leave would be implemented over his dead body. Now

having today another change to paid paternity leave.

The real Tony Abbott saying, no tax increase and yet we've seen tax increases including links to paid

paternity leave and what we now need is scrutiny on Tony Abbott. We know the election is tight. We know

it's tough. We'd like to have a debate on the economy…

JULIE BISHOP:        Hang on, Stephen.

STEPHEN SMITH:   … which he's walking away from.

JULIE BISHOP:        Stephen, Stephen, why did Julia Gillard present a false version of herself for the last five

weeks of this campaign? I mean, she has said to the Australian people that what you saw for the last five

weeks is not the real Julia Gillard…

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, she hasn't said that at all.

JULIE BISHOP:        … well, why did she present a false version of herself…

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, she hasn't said that at all.

JULIE BISHOP:        … and as for the debate, let me come to the debate.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        I want, in fact I want to talk about that in a few moments…

JULIE BISHOP:        Thanks, Geoff, okay.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        … so let's worked through some things first. Julie Bishop, you must have felt

among friends at Diggers and Dealers yesterday. More than 2000 miners, the Federal Government

accused of being communists, economic terrorists and there was a plea to all and sundry to vote for the

Coalition.

JULIE BISHOP:        The Western Australian mining sector is clearly very angry that a Labor Government

wants to foist an additional tax on this industry, particularly as there are fledging iron ore projects in,

particularly the mid-west of Western Australia. They are very angry that a government wants to put an

additional tax on them that will make it internationally uncompetitive. It has raised the issue of sovereign

risk, will costs jobs, will stop projects, will damage foreign investment.

And Stephen Smith should be ashamed that he stood up for the original tax. He said that that 40 per cent

tax was good. He argued for it strongly and people are wondering why is it that Stephen Smith won't

stand up for the people of Western Australia? Now a Coalition Government will, we will not burden our

mining sector with an additional tax. They pay company tax, they pay state royalties, they pay payroll tax,

a whole raft of taxes.

If Labor stopped the spending, the reckless spending, they wouldn't need to burden a section of the

economy with an additional tax to pay for…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Stephen Smith, I'll be with you in just half a second and some other people might

have also thought it was a good old fashioned 1950s battle cry from those who've earned the right to

mine Australia's resources but don't want to pay their country any more to do so.

Stephen Smith, you said yesterday, this is political.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Of course it's political.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        But why shouldn't it be political?

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, it's in the context of an election campaign, people go to a Diggers and Dealers

function and urge people to vote Liberal and support …

JULIE BISHOP:        And if I went to a union campaign launch?

STEPHEN SMITH:   … advertising… I let you go with your go, Julie.

JULIE BISHOP:        If I went to a union campaign though?

STEPHEN SMITH:   Julie, I let you go with your …

JULIE BISHOP:        Wouldn't they be screaming vote Labor?

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Stephen Smith.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Thank you, Geoff. I let you go, Julie. What we saw yesterday was essentially urging

people to vote Liberal. Advertising campaigns supporting the Liberal Party. We made substantial changes

to an original proposal and what we've seen, with the changes we've made, supported by BHP, supported

by Rio Tinto, supported by Xstrata, supported by the overwhelming majority of the minerals and

petroleum resources industry. That's the first point.

Secondly…

JULIE BISHOP:        Not true.

STEPHEN SMITH:   … the new tax only applies if you make a profit of $50 million or more a year. Only

applies if you make a profit of $50 million or more a year.

We have established under Don Argus, including representatives well known in Western Australia in the

minerals and petroleum resources industry, a committee to implement the fine details of that.

We made substantial changes and those changes were good. What we now see are people saying, if you

are in the iron ore industry, if you are in the coal industry, you are only subject to this tax if you make

$50 million or more profit a year. In the meantime, we say, the community is entitled to get a fair return

on the use of resources and we want to use those resources to substantially increase infrastructure

investment in Western Australia which will not occur under Tony Abbott.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        A lot of people would like to speak to both of you. Let's begin with Len.

Good morning, Len.

CALLER LEN:          Ah, good morning. I'd like to pose a question to Ms Bishop. Now we had through the

major companies have agreed to pay five, it comes out to 10.5 billion. Now as I understand it, that's over

two years. So my calculation is five and a quarter billion per year and assuming everything keeps going

the same it's going to be five and a quarter billion…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        So what's the question, Len?

CALLER LEN:          … every year. Now this, this tax is a payment to the owners of these resources. Once

these resources are gone, we'll be getting nothing and it belongs to the people of Australia. It doesn't

belong to Rudd, it doesn't belong to Gillard, it doesn't belong to Abbott. It's our money, every individual

Australian and yet he's prepared…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        So your question is what, Len?

CALLER LEN:          … he's prepared to - I'm coming to it - he's prepared to, if Abbott gets elected they're

prepared to throw that money away.

JULIE BISHOP:        Len, the mining companies already pay a price for access to minerals. It's a state

royalty. In this state of WA, BHP and Rio agreed to pay a higher state royalty of another $300 million and

Colin Barnett has earmarked that for a children's hospital. That's how state royalties are meant to work.

But what the government is doing, the Federal Government is doing, they're whacking a huge additional

tax on one of our most productive industries.

There are thousands of workers in Stephen Smith's electorate and across this state, who depend on a

viable profitable industry. If you're going to put a huge tax on top of a mining sector, you are going to

make projects unviable. If Labor stopped spending - I mean, they blew $8 billion on a rorted school

building program. They're going to blow $43 billion on a white elephant of a national broadband network.

The only reason Labor has grabbed this money off the mining companies, is they can't control their own

spending. Let's stop the reckless spending and let's stop taxing our most profitable industries.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Stephen Smith.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Geoff, what we did, was we ensured that the country didn't go into recession. Julie

Bishop and Tony Abbott said that they would not have done what we did. The country would have gone

into recession …

JULIE BISHOP:        We wouldn't have blown billions of dollars on useless programs…

STEPHEN SMITH:   … unemployment would have skyrocketed. We would have gone into recession. Tony

Abbott said, nearly a year ago that our model was New Zealand. He said, look, New Zealand's doing well.

He didn't even know that New Zealand had gone into recession for 12 months.

Unless we had acted in the face of the global financial crisis, we would now have high unemployment.

We've now…

JULIE BISHOP:        … Stephen, stand up for Western Australia and stop this tax.

STEPHEN SMITH:   … we've now got three per cent inflation, we've got five per cent employment and we've

got the lowest debt in modern economies. We have a debt that will peak at about six per cent, the

average debt in modern economies after the global financial crisis is 95 per cent. We're coming into

surplus in three year's time…

JULIE BISHOP:        … you've never delivered a surplus, Stephen, you have never delivered a surplus …

STEPHEN SMITH:   … three years earlier than anyone else. Now I haven't seen, I haven't seen Julie go out

to her schools in her electorate, to the Catholic schools and the state schools in her electorate, and say, I

stood on the floor of the Parliament and opposed all the building improvements that we've seen. You

haven't heard her say that.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Have you been photographed next to a new school building in your electorate?

JULIE BISHOP:        No, I haven't, and $8 billion…

STEPHEN SMITH:   So you oppose them?

JULIE BISHOP:        … $8 billion worth of waste…

STEPHEN SMITH:   So you're going to all your schools and telling all your schools you don't support the

building programs? Are you going …

JULIE BISHOP:        It's a crime against the tax payers…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        … you're telling all the Catholic schools in your electorate that you don't support

the building program?

Now I'll say it to both of you because I don't want to pull your photos down because that would be rude

and you are very polite people normally. People do not want to hear you at cross purposes when you're

answering a question. So I'd ask that you, at least, show the other a modicum of respect and also …

STEPHEN SMITH:   A call I asked for earlier, you will recall, Geoff.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        It's more points scoring - and some respect for our audience too.

Craig, good morning.

CALLER CRAIG:     Good morning, Geoff, how are you going?

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Very well. What's your question, Craig?

CALLER CRAIG:     Good morning, Minister. Good morning, Julie.

JULIE BISHOP:        Good morning.

CALLER CRAIG:     Two things. Firstly, I'd like to thank Labor for one putting my job at risk. I work in the

mining industry. Thank you very much for that and also thank you for putting my great grandkids into

debt for the rest of their lives.

The question I've actually got for Stephen Smith is, why has Labor, when we're a leader in the Pacific ring,

why has Labor snubbed its nose at the Pacific nations by not attending, initially not going to send at least

a senior minister, let alone the Prime Minister. But now sending the minister because they know they've

basically got it wrong?

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, with respect you're wrong on every count. We saved your job because, if we hadn't

acted as we did, the country would have gone into recession. That's what Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop

would have done. Firstly.

Secondly, our minerals and petroleum resources industry continues to go from strength to strength, as

the objective data showed yesterday, even at Diggers and Dealers.

What we are doing is making sure the Western Australia and the Australian community get a fair return on

a one-off use of resources, iron ore, coal and petroleum resources.

That system has worked very well for the petroleum resources industry with the petroleum resources rent

tax. We'll have a mineral resources rent tax which will enable us to put substantial infrastructure

investment, $2 billion over 10 years, into roads, ports, rail, general infrastructure in Western Australia.

Thirdly, so far as the Pacific Islands Forum is concerned, on the first day of the campaign, I said that I

would let my travel arrangements be known as they came up, in accordance with my usual practice which

I have done.

The Prime Minister and I made it clear from the outset that she wasn't able to attend the Pacific Island

Forum and that we would make sure a senior minister was there. Over the weekend, I announced that I

would attend. This is the same model that the Howard Government followed when variously Alexander

Downer and Peter Reith represented Australia.

That's what I'll be doing. I'm heading off this afternoon. We have made substantial progress in our

relationship with the Pacific. When we came to office, the Australia PNG relationship was in tatters, as was

the Australia Solomon Islands relationship. Both of those have been repaired.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Craig, thank you for your question. We'll come back to more questions in a

moment. But Julie Bishop, you just mentioned, a few moments ago, about the great waste that is the

national broadband policy. And Queensland says, so what are the Libs offering instead of a broadband

network? Or will we be left behind in the dark ages?

JULIE BISHOP:        No, we won't.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        When we see your communications policy?

JULIE BISHOP:        Well we have two weeks to go. We'll be announcing - more than two weeks - we'll be

announcing a broadband policy shortly. I'm not the shadow minister for communications so I'll leave that

to Tony Smith. It will be deliverable. It will be real and it will address the concerns that people have about

Labor's broadband policy. Now this was a…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        But you will axe that which has already begun.

JULIE BISHOP:        Well it's a $43 billion announcement that was basically done on the back of a postage

stamp. It had no business plan, no detail at all as to how Labor could deliver it. It was just a $43 billion

slug against the taxpayers.

We had a broadband plan going into the last election. In fact, we had contracts signed, ready to roll out.

Had Labor not messed up the tender for this project, people would have broadband now. So we will

announce a deliverable, realistic broadband policy that the Australian public can afford.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        We had the independent communications analyst, Paul Budde, on the program

on Friday, who said that this broadband policy represented an outstanding piece of infrastructure…

JULIE BISHOP:        Well I disagree with him. That Labor cannot be trusted to roll out a $43 billion

program. They can't be trusted to give away free pink batts without causing huge tragedies in the home

insulation scheme.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Are they responsible for the deaths of those people?

JULIE BISHOP:        Well I have never known, I have never known a federal government program that has

ended up with huge waste, 240,000 homes electrified and the tragic death of four young installers. I

mean, it is a debacle, that program.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Would you stand in the parliament and blame the government for the death of

installers?

JULIE BISHOP:        I would ask the Federal Government to apologise for what happened under that home

insulation program, just as I would expect Julia Gillard to apologise for the waste under the home - under

the school building program and Peter Garrett to apologise for the waste under the Green Loans Program.

This Government is incompetent. It cannot be trusted to manage taxpayers' money. We've seen it with

state Labor around the country. We're now seeing it with federal Labor as well.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Stephen Smith.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Investment in infrastructure is what we need to continue to take our economy forward.

Having made sure the country didn't go into a recession, having made sure we didn't have skyrocketing

unemployment, having made sure we've got lower debt than the rest of the international community, we

now need to continue to make the investments to keep our economy strong and to move forward.

Investment in infrastructure, roads, rails that I've referred to. Investment also in broadband. This has been

one of the great crimes of the lost years of Howard, when there was no investment in our broadband

infrastructure. We're now making a substantial investment into that.

And Paul Budde is one of the country's leading analysts in this area and he is absolutely correct. We need

to continue these investments, in education, in skills and training, in infrastructure. All of these things

will be cut by Tony Abbott. All of these things will be cut.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        It's 22 minutes after nine. We need to go to your calls and an area of relevance

and importance to both your portfolios. This is Scott. Good morning.

CALLER SCOTT:     Good morning to all. How are you?

JULIE BISHOP:        Very well.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Good.

CALLER SCOTT:     That's good. This is a question to you, Julie.

JULIE BISHOP:        Yes.

CALLER SCOTT:     I'd like you to just imagine a scenario where you're living in a country that was being

run by sort of extremist groups that were getting more powerful all the time. And you and your family

were under threat all the time of death or torture. And a guy comes along and says, I can get you on a

boat for a fee, to a country that respects human rights. And you'll be safe or you can get bombed. What

would you do?

JULIE BISHOP:        Well I've got to tell you that there is nothing compassionate about encouraging the

people smuggling trade to flourish. And we've now seen, under Labor's changed laws, they weakened our

border protection laws. We've seen an 800 per cent increase in the number of people flowing into

Indonesia who are going to take that really dangerous journey across the seas to Australia.

Now in the last 12 months, we've heard reports and we've actually seen instances where people have

drowned, people have died, taking that journey from Sri Lanka or Indonesia to Australia. There is nothing

compassionate about encouraging the people smuggling trade.

We must work with the United Nations, the UNHCR, to ensure that they are able to process asylum

seekers and of course we are a signatory to the Geneva Convention. We must process asylum seekers in

an orderly way. Australia is a very generous country in terms of resettlement of asylum seekers and

people under refugee and humanitarian status. And we should continue to do that.

But we cannot lose control of our borders to the people smuggling trade. And if you saw the Four Corners

program on ABC last night, you would be deeply concerned about the corruption that is going on within

this people smuggling trade. We must put a stop to that and give the United Nations the opportunity to

do its work properly.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Okay. So that means you are supportive of the UNHCR. What about Nauru?

JULIE BISHOP:        Always have been.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Nauru and the fact that UNHCR has not endorsed Nauru as a place.

JULIE BISHOP:        Well that's not right. When we built a processing centre in Nauru, when the Howard

Government built that, the UNHCR was involved in that. The detention centre, the processing centre, was

actually run under the auspices of the International Organisation for Migration.

And I note that Stephen Smith says he is going to the Pacific Islands Forum. Representatives of Nauru will

be there. I expect Stephen will be talking to these representatives because they have a ready-to-go,

purpose-built Australian taxpayer-funded processing centre on Nauru. And they are asking the Australian

Government to negotiate with them so that they will have a solution to the problem.

Now the Government says that they're going to put a processing centre on East Timor. So replicate what's

on Nauru, make the Australian taxpayers pay for it again in East Timor. And I want to know, why did

Stephen Smith advise Julia Gillard to contact the President of East Timor instead of the Prime Minister?

And why…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        I'd like Stephen Smith to be able to answer the question, just a moment please.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well there's a range of issues there. Firstly, we respect our obligations under the

Refugee Convention. If someone claims asylum, we process them under the Refugee Convention. Anyone

who comes to Australia has to satisfy the Refugee Convention test, plus our own quarantine health

security arrangements.

And if someone is accorded refugee status by the UNHCR, they still have to satisfy our test, which

includes security and criminal tests and the like.

Secondly, so far as Indonesia is concerned, respective Australian governments have worked closely with

Indonesia over a long period of time. Yes, there are difficulties in Indonesia. And I have the same

concerns that my counterpart Indonesian Foreign Minister, Marty Natalegawa, raised last night. But we

continue to work very closely with Indonesia…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        When do we get confirmation though? When do we get confirmation that these

talks with East Timor are more than just talks?

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, there's a raft of issues you let Julie go through and I'll do the same thing. We

believe that an offshore processing centre would help because it would stop people smugglers having the

capacity to encourage people to make very dangerous journeys on the waters.

Now, we've had offshore processing in the past, in Nauru and Manus Island. And Julie is not right. When

Manus Island and Nauru were used, they were used unilaterally or bilaterally. There was no regional

support. They brought Australia's reputation into disrepute. They weren't supported by the region. They

were not supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

We need to have an offshore processing centre that is supported by the United Nations High Commission

for Refugees and is supported by the region, through the Bali Process or generally. Now we're in

discussions with East Timor…

JULIE BISHOP:        Not according to East Timor.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Julie Bishop should pay more respect to President Ramos-Horta than she and Scott

Morrison have been doing lately. He made it clear, last week, that discussions continue. Our officials have

been in discussion with East Timorese officials and…

JULIE BISHOP:        Not according to the Deputy Prime Minister.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well…

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Let me ask you.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Let me finish by making this point. If you go to Nauru, which is not a signatory to the

Refugee Convention, you will not get the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

You will not get the support of the region. You will not get the support of settlement and resettlement

countries in addition to Australia and New Zealand, the United States, Canada, European countries.

You need to have endorsement and support by the UNHCR. Nauru is not a signatory to the Refugee

Convention.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Okay. Let me just ask you though. It does seem that both sides of politics are

happy enough to pursue an out of sight, out of mind policy, a little bit here. A question for Ms Bishop too,

is just how many of those asylum seekers that were held in Nauru ended up in Australia anyway.

JULIE BISHOP:        The point is once we put in place tough border protection laws, the number of asylum

seekers coming reduced dramatically. In fact, in 2002/2003 no boats arrived. The next year: one. The

year after that: two.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Can you answer my question?

JULIE BISHOP:        So the point is, we cut down dramatically the number of people seeking asylum, and

then of those who did go to Nauru and were processed, most of them came to Australia. But we cut down

the numbers. So instead of there being hundreds of boats arriving, as there are now, there were virtually

none.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Yeah, yeah. The answer is, Geoff...

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Very briefly, and then I want to move on...

STEPHEN SMITH:   People stopped coming because of changed circumstances in Afghanistan. That's the

first thing. Secondly, 96 per cent of people who were assessed as refugees in Nauru came to Australia or

New Zealand. Ninety six per cent.

That's because the way in which the Howard Government put up the Nauru off-shore detention centre did

not have the support of settlement and re-settlement countries. Ninety six per cent came to Australia and

New Zealand.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Julie Bishop, I have to tell you that we're getting many text messages saying,

could you please stop interrupting. So I am going to regain the floor to let John ask a question. John,

good morning.

CALLER JOHN:       Yes, good morning. Good morning Geoff, good morning both of you. I'm going to ask a

question or make a statement that nobody, not one politician I've spoken to, wants to address. And that

is under the British Constitution not one person, Julia Gillard included, can be a member of our

parliament, state or federal, as a declared Agnostic.

The Queen is protector of the faith. We have her flag in the top left hand corner of our flag which says

that we are also protectors of the faith, and she cannot even be a member of parliament. For God's sake,

don't put her in as Prime Minister.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        John, thank you very much. Does atheism matter, Julie Bishop?

JULIE BISHOP:        Well, I think he's raised a constitutional issue, and I'm certainly not across that side of

the constitution...

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        It's a nonsensical constitutional issue as you well know.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well, it's a nonsense, and Julie knows that, firstly. Secondly, we are a...

JULIE BISHOP:        Well I'm sorry, but he raised it.

STEPHEN SMITH:   ...secular society. What is important, the values, and the virtues and the principles that

people bring to their deliberations. Some Members of the Parliament are of a religious faith. Some

members aren't. It's the values and virtues and principles that people bring and the policies that they

support.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Have many people in your career - I'm just wondering - have many people...

JULIE BISHOP:        Can I just say I was responding to the caller. I thought he was trying to raise it as a

constitutional point. I have no idea if it's a constitutional point, but I agree with Stephen. People have

different views, different faiths, different values, and they will be judged accordingly. So I don't think it's

an issue.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Has there ever been a point of empathy between you and the Prime Minister on

the issue of being an unmarried woman in politics?

JULIE BISHOP:        Well I've been married. I'm not now, but it's not an issue I've discussed with Julia

Gillard. It's not an issue. I don't think...

STEPHEN SMITH:   And I don't think it's relevant. It's not relevant.

JULIE BISHOP:        I don't think any female Member of Parliament's ever discussed it. I mean, we want to

be judged on our merit. We want to be judged on our performance. We don't want to be judged on

gender.

We don't have a quota system in the Liberal Party that means that you have to have a particular number of

women filling particular number of seats, and I think all women in Australia want to be judged on their

merit, their performance and their ability, and not their chromosome make up.

STEPHEN SMITH:   And the policies that they support. So it's all well and good for Tony to surround

himself with women, but on paid paternity leave...

JULIE BISHOP:        Oh, come on, that's his family.

STEPHEN SMITH:   ...he said not over my dead body.

JULIE BISHOP:        That's his family, and it's this idea that we're playing a family card is just bizarre.

People want to know about the politicians. Tony happens to have three beautiful daughters. He's got

three sisters who are as feisty as all get out, and his mum, who I met the other day.  I mean he just

happens to be surrounded by women. I don't think he should have to hide that.

STEPHEN SMITH:   And...

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        [Interrupts] On behalf of the Australian electorate I hope that we do see the real

Julia Gillard. I hope we see the real Tony Abbott. I think it's sad that we are now in the situation where

we're talking about whether there is going to be a debate or not. There is much concern in the electorate.

I hate hearing people say, this has been the most listless election campaign in the memory of so many

people.

Stephen, all sides of politics have fallen short. Can you tell me, very briefly, what's the second half of this

campaign going to be like? Is it going to get murkier? Is it going to get nastier because the stakes

obviously just get higher?

STEPHEN SMITH:   Well it needs to focus on the issues. We need to focus on the economy and economic

management, and that's why I'm shocked and surprised that Tony Abbott would run away from a debate

on the economy. The real Tony Abbott would never have run away from a debate on the economy.

But we know why, because we know he has no interest in the economy. We know that he has no

understanding of economic matters. We know that Peter Costello has essentially called him an economic

illiterate. So there needs to be a focus on the economy.

All things go from the economy. Our investment into the future, the capacity to provide education and

health services and the capacity to do the things we need to do, like infrastructure.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Julia, speak in 30 seconds, or else I'll be in a lot of trouble for not getting to the

news.

JULIE BISHOP:        Labor inherited zero government debt. They inherited a $20 billion surplus. They've

now turned that $20 billion surplus into a $40 billion deficit. They've gone from zero government debt to

$90 billion in government debt. And what have we got to show for it? A failed home insulation program, a

failed school building program, a failed Green Loans program, a failed national broadband network.

Labor cannot be trusted with money. We will restore the budget to surplus, we will stop the taxes, we will

stop the waste, and we will govern for all Australians, because they're concerned about the cost of living,

and we will ease the pressure on the cost of living for all Australians.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        Ding-ding, you're time is up. Now, Julie Bishop and Stephen Smith...

JULIE BISHOP:        Thank you.

STEPHEN SMITH:   Thank you.

GEOFF HUTCHISON:        ...we very much appreciate you coming into the studio this morning.
