Australia at all levels and a firm belief in our potential  for national development," Mr MacKellar said,

"I emphasised that char immigration program was directed  to permanent settlement in Australia and not the sort of guest-  worker schemes that have applied in Europe in recent years.

"I explained that tie are seeking people who will fit  into the Australian community in present conditions - people who  wish to make a new life in Australia for themselves and their  children.

"That our whole system of immigration and ethnic affairs

is based on this Â«* from the selection and counselling stages  overseas to our intensified integration and ethnic affairs programs  in Australia. .'

"I stressed also that we attach great importance to Ã¢ÂÂ   Â· * Â£

development of those aspects of their cultural heritage which

our migrants wish to retain in Australia."

Mr MacKellar said the Ministers he had talked to had  mentioned the value of immigration in strengthening ties between  their countries and Australia.

"Australia has been enriched by the cultural diversity  migration has brought," he added. "But the links between migrants  and their former homelands have brought a much greater knowledge  of Australia and our way of life to a wide range of people overseas.

"I was pleased to see at first hand the thriving course  in Australian literature conducted at the University of Venice  by an Australian, Professor Bernard Hickey."

Mr MacKellar said that the Italian Government was  giving further emphasis to promoting cultural links with

Australia and would be sending two cultural attaches to  Australia in the very near future.

*ri was especially pleased with the results of the  discussion in theÃ¢ÂÂ Joint Commission established under the Italian -  Australian Migration and Settlement Agreement," Mr MacKellar said.

"The Joint Commission considered teacher exchanges, sending  Australian social workers and welfare officers to Italy, assessment  of Italian professional, technical and sub-professional as well

as trade qualifications for Australian recognition purposes, and  teaching of Italian language and culture in Australian schools.

"For its part, the Italian Government laid special  emphasis on the importance it attaches to early conclusion of  a social security agreement between Italy and Australia. I

shall be bringing its concern to the attention of the Minister  for Social Security,

"I was also pleased to find that His Beatitude, President

Makarios, is very hopeful of being able to visit Australia later

this year.

"During my stay in Nicosia I was able to see at first  hand our migration office handling the Lebanese migration operation

there

"The whole operation has been a large-scale one and  the Australian immigration officers there have worked long  hours under great pressure. The numbers of Lebanese people  applying to come to Australia have now dropped off and it

should be possible to scale down the task force."

.  The Cypriot authorities had paid tribute to the

work of the Australian task force and a spirit of close coÂ­ operation prevailed, he added.

Mr MacKellar said that he also had visited Thailand

to make a personal assessment of the Indo-Chinese refugee  problem there.

MTn talks with the 'Thai Minister for the Interior,

top level Thai officials and the local representatives of the  United Nations High Commissioner for refugees T was assured  that Australian action to resettle refugees was greatly appreciated  and had made a significant contribution to easing the plight of

the refugees.

"There is no doubt that the Thai authorities are  faced with a major refugee problem," Mr MacKellar said. "However,  the number of refugees to be resettled outside the immediate  region is much smaller than the total number of refugees now in  Thailand

"Most of the refugees now in Thailand belong to large

communities who see their future close to their former homelands.  The Australian contribution to the refugee resettlement operation

organised by the UNHCR must, be seen in that light."
