AUSTRALIA HELPS SOM ALI REFUGEES RETURN HOME

Australia will provide $1 million towards the repatriation of Somali refugees, the Minister for  Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney said today.

Funds from the government's overseas aid agency, AusAID, will support programs o f the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

"Although more than 1.5 million Somalis have fled the horrors o f their country over the past  five years, many are now returning," M r Bilney said. "The challenge for aid agencies is to help  re-establish these people in their homeland."

"In spite o f some progress since the height o f the civil war and famine in 1991-92, the Somalia  to which they are returning remains unstable.

"Due to current political uncertainty and insecurity, relief organisations anticipate emergency  needs escalating in some areas."

Australia will contribute $1 million towards UNHCR's Appeal for US $10.7 million to  repatriate over 500,000 Somali refugees from eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti to northwest  Somalia, and a further 45,000 Somalia/Kenya cross-border returnees.

Today's announcement brings total Australian Government aid for Somalia to around $12  million since 1991.
