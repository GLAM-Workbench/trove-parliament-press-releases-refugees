E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

JOE HOCKEY:

It is fantastic to be here at the launch of Michael Feneley’s campaign for Kingsford Smith. He is an  outstanding candidate - being a leading cardiologist working at the Victor Chang Centre - but also he  is  of  the  people  here  in  Kingsford  Smith.  After  the  experience  with  Peter  Garrett  you  would  think   that the people of Kingsford Smith would want a change. I have no doubt they will go for change.

The Labor Party has chosen as their candidate someone who is up to his armpits in Eddie Obeid. The  fact  is  that  when  you  look  carefully  at  your  Labor  candidates,  look  carefully  for  their  deep   association  with  Eddie  Obeid  and  people  that  are  part  of  the  rotten  family  of  Labor  because  Mr   Thistlethwaite is,  in  fact,  one  of  those  people,  having  spent  an  enormous  amount  of  time  working

with Eddie Obeid here in NSW. They are all fingers on the same hand. Labor pretends that with a  new campaign comes a new Labor. But it is the same  old  Labor  and  it’s  the  same  old  people  that   Eddie  Obeid  controlled.  In  fact  many  of  them  helped  to  control  Eddie  Obeid.  This  [Feneley]  is  a   candidate for real change. Labor has been running on a campaign of a change in Government before  the election is actually held. People will see through that they will see that Labor is still old Labor.  You can put lipstick on a crocodile but it’s still the same old Labor.

Speaking of lipstick on a crocodile, when it comes to waste it is the same old Labor, and I’m glad to  be  here  with  my  colleague  Jamie  Briggs  who  is  the  member  for  Mayo.  We  are  launching  another   publication  - not  funded  by  taxpayers  - which  focuses  on  the  waste  of  Kevin  Rudd.  It  is  quite  a   legendary  list  of  waste.  It  is  not  a  children’s  book  because  it  is  a  horror  story.  But  it  is   unquestionably  part  of  the  record  Kevin  Rudd  wants  to  distance  himself  from  - so  it  is  hugely   important we do that today. I’ll ask Jamie to say a few words.

JAMIE BRIGGS:

Thanks Joe. We are launching today the Big Waste and Chaos Book which is a companion that goes  with  the  Little  Book  of  Big  Labor  Waste we  launched  just  before  the  Budget.  This  focuses  on  the   record  of  Kevin  Rudd  and  the  fact  that  he  authored  many  of  the  wasteful  programs  which  saw  so   much waste, so much deficit and so much debt the Australian tax payer has been lumbered with by  this Labor Party. It is intergenerational theft when Governments waste taxpayers’ money. It is right  to  be  prudent,  it  is  right  not  to  waste  taxpayers.  It  is  right  not  to  run  full  page  ads  in  national   newspapers  daily  focused  on  vote  people  not  boat  people.  Kevin  Rudd’s  record  is  appalling  and  a   leopard  doesn’t  change  his  spots.  If  Kevin  Rudd  is  re-elected  and  Labor  get  another  go  they  will

waste more money. They will have more deficits and they will have more debt. People in Kingsford  Smith know their former local Member, Peter Garrett, was responsible for many of the examples in  here  along  with  Kevin  Rudd  and  they  know  if  they  get  Matt  Thistlethwaite,  they  will  have  Eddie   Obeid’s man in Canberra. There’s a very clear choice between the Coalition with the Real Solutions  plan  for  a  stronger  future.  We  won’t  waste  money;  we  will  treat  taxpayers’  money  with  respect.   Kevin Rudd and Labor will bring more waste, more deficit and more debt. Thank you.

JOE HOCKEY:

Do you want to say something Michael?

MICHAEL FENELEY

I’m very pleased to be representing the people of Kingsford Smith. People tell me on the street when  I am out there every day, that they are sick of the waste, deficit and debt of this Government. They  are very impatient to be able to vote. They would love to be able to express their opinion and they  ask me all the time when can we have an election. I’m very pleased to be here. I have been in this  area all my adult life, I’ve worked in the public hospital sector all that time and I am very concerned  by some of the things that Labor has done in this area. We have had terrible problems with the cuts  to university funding. The University of New South Wales is our biggest employer, and we’ve had  terrible  cuts  to  the  state  health  budget.  $100  million  since  Tanya  Plibersek  took  over  the  health   ministry. Money was given back in Victoria directly to the hospitals. That has not happened here and  if anyone is really worried - if my opponent is really worried about our local hospitals - they should  ask  Tanya  Plibersek  to  give  the  money  back.  $100  million  from  the  state  health  Budget  with  no   accountability. Thanks very much.

JOE HOCKEY:

We’ll go to questions.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Hockey, Tony Abbott has indicated that he would introduce the Paid Parental Scheme. Is that an  iron-clad commitment or is that an aspiration?

JOE HOCKEY:

We will be bringing in a fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave Scheme because it is a key productivity  measure. It is one thing to talk about productivity, it is another thing to initiate policies that improve  productivity. If we can improve the workforce participation levels of women then we will improve  productivity, there is no doubt about that. Our Paid Parental Leave Scheme has many motivations.  One of them is that it is actually about equality of opportunity for small business because while big  business can pay paid parental entitlements, small business can’t match them on the same level, they  just  can’t.  Therefore  we  are  going  to  give  small  business  the  biggest  leg  up  they  have  ever  had  in   being able to compete for labour with big business.

JOURNALIST:

Is the Coalition going to introduce it though?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

In  regards  to  the  car  industry,  we’re  waiting  for  a  car  industry  announcement  in  terms  of  more   funding. Will the Coalition support more spending?

JOE HOCKEY:

You should not have to spend more money because we would not do the damage to the car industry  that Labor is doing. This FBT change announced by Kevin Rudd is like a baseball bat to the back of  the head of the car industry - now they are offering the car industry a Panadol to get over the pain.  It’s  not  a  solution.  The  fact  is,  the  people  most  affected  by  Kevin  Rudd’s  changes  on  FBT  are   Holden, Toyota, Ford and a large chunk of those are Australian made vehicles like the Commodore.  I’d say to you, it is an enormous irony that on the one hand the Government is taking $1.8 billion out  of the car industry and on the other hand they are claiming they are doing a good thing by giving  them an extra $200 million back. The sums just don’t add up from Labor.

JOURNALIST:

So would you just sort of let it fend for itself?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. We are totally opposed to the changes to FBT. We see it as stupid policy, made on the run. The  numbers  are  dead  wrong.  The  [number  of]  people  affected  that  the  Government  has  identified  are   dead wrong. The fact is, the people most affected earn less than $100,000 a year and most of them  are driving around in Holdens, Fords and Toyotas.

JOURNALIST:

Are  you  expecting  a  further  delay  in  the  election  date  now  that  Federal  Labor  is  looking  for  more   budget savings?

JOE HOCKEY:

Kevin Rudd is running scared. Everything in Kevin Rudd’s life is benchmarked against what he has  done in his past. The fact of the matter is, if Kevin Rudd is doing so well - if celebrity Kevin is in  fact as popular as he thinks he is - he would be going to the polls. I suspect there is a lot more to this  than meets the eye.

JOURNALIST:

So will the Coalition go ahead with its plan to cut $500 million from the car industry?

JOE HOCKEY:

What  we  have  said  is  that  we  are  not  going  to  add  further  money  to  the  car  industry  because  we   would not be doing the pain to the car industry that Labor is doing. It is only under Labor that car  manufacturers are closing in Australia - it is only under Labor. It is not under us. They had record  years  under  us  in  Government.  Under  Labor  they  are  closing  -under  Labor  they  are  threatening  to   close, so same old Labor.

JOURNALIST:

But if you are going to be cutting money to the industry surely it will be worse off?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. Because you know what, no industry can rely on Government forever for handouts to survive.  You need to have a strong economy and the only way to have a strong economy is to vote for the   Coalition  because  we  are  focused  on  lifting  the  tides  so  all  boats  rise,  rather  than  going  down  the

path  of  Labor  where  you  are  trying  to  pick  winners  and  compensate  losers.   The  fact  is,  the   Government is taking a baseball bat to the car industry. I need to say it again? Just walk through the  car yards, speak to people over the weekend, and ask them what the impact of the FBT decision by  Kevin Rudd is.

JOURNALIST:

In  relation  to  a  second  Sydney  airport,  Anthony  Albanese  said  that  construction  would  start  in  the   first term of Government. Would the Coalition match that?

JOE HOCKEY:

Anthony Albanese hasn’t committed to anything yet. He has not committed any money, he has not  identified where it is going to be built. My views on a second Sydney airport are very well known.  I’ve  held  them  consistently  for  17  years,  if  not  longer.  It  is  the  Government  that  has  all  the   information before it. I want a second airport and I want it now but it’s only the Government that can  make that decision because it’s only the Government that has that information. That’s certainly not  available to the Opposition or anyone else.

JOURNALIST:

Joe, there is a story just emerging on Pixifoto, one of the iconic Australian brands going under in the  last 24 hours. They are talking dozens of job losses in Sydney and around. Are you aware of this or  know anything more or have you been aware of a decline in that industry?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. Wherever there are job losses it hurts but why is it consistently occurring under Labor and no  one is seeing the connection? Famous iconic Australian brands from Darrell Lea to the job losses at  Pacific Brands to outright closures, particularly in manufacturing. This is happening under Labor and  you have got to understand that when you keep adding costs onto businesses - whether it be changes  without warning on FBT or be it increasing the carbon price, or be it all the regulation  that is like a  ball and chain around the leg of business - all of it costs jobs. Why is it a surprise that people are  losing jobs now because the fundamentals put in place by the Labor Government make job creation  very hard, it’s so obvious!

JOURNALIST:

Can I ask you about the FBT because you keep going on about this? But what’s wrong with asking  people to keep their receipts for their deductions? Everybody else has to.

JOE HOCKEY:

It  was  Labor  that  introduced  the  statutory  20%  limit  in  response  to  the  recommendations  of  the   Henry Review. They said that they wanted to do that in order to save costs, which they did but more  importantly because the red tape burden associated with FBT comes at a huge price. By the way, if  an employee gets the FBT numbers wrong, it is the employer that ends up picking up the bill. What  we  have  seen  is  a  number  of  employers  now  are  closing  down  their  car  fleets.  They  are  saying   “Okay,  well  no  more  motor  vehicles  for  their  employees”.  What  that  means  is  that  the  Australian   vehicle  fleet  will  age,  meaning  it  is  more  dangerous  obviously,  with  having  an  older  car  fleet  in   Australia.  But  it  also  means  that  there  are  fewer  sales  and  the  motor  vehicle  industry  is  smaller.   Frankly  this  is  not  an  integrity  measure.  Bill  Shorten  says  it  is  not  an  integrity  measure,  it  is  a   sustainability measure, he said. But then Kevin Rudd and Chris Bowen say it’s an integrity measure.  They can’t even get their narrative right.

JOURNALIST:

But they can still claim those deductions, so what’s changed?

JOE HOCKEY:

What’s changed? The massive amount of red tape has changed. Also the fact that the statutory limit  was imposed to give people the opportunity who were engaged in a hell of a lot of travel associated  with work like nurses, charity workers and the like. They had the opportunity to use their cars and  take them home as part of the employment package. Now you are going to see charities come to the  Government  asking  for  a  significant  increase  in  funding  because  the  Government  has  changed  the   salary  packaging  rules.  You  are  going  to  see  nurses;  you  are  going  to  see  defence  force  personnel   and a vast range of public servants come asking for pay rises as compensation for losing their cars.  You are going to see wage claims around the place. Then unsurprisingly, the Government wouldn’t  raise its $1.8 billion which it claims its going to raise, but it ends end up with an older car fleet and it  ends up with Holden, Toyota and Ford selling fewer Australian made cars here in Australia.
