ADDITIONAL 
HELP FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUNG AUSTRALIANS

Â

11 May 1999

"Young people at risk will benefit from a $60 
million continuation of a programme that helps them to overcome barriers 
to getting stable accommodation, finding work, accessing training, or 
re-entering the education system," the Parliamentary Secretary 
for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Ms Trish Worth announced 
today.

The continuation of funding means that the Job Placement, 
Education and Training Programme (JPET) will receive Government support 
until at least 2003.

"The JPET Programme is unique because it provides 
a number of flexible, integrated services that meet the range of needs 
of young people at risk," said Ms Worth.

JPET assists young people aged 15-21 who are homeless 
or at risk of becoming homeless, are ex-offenders, or who are or have 
been wards of the state, as well as refugees.

Contracted organisations across Australia help these 
young people overcome a range of problems, including housing, family 
problems, lack of self-esteem, lack of income support, sexual or other 
abuse, substance abuse and other barriers to employment, education and 
training.

"The help JPET provides makes a significant 
difference to many thousands of disadvantaged young Australians. The 
Government’s renewed commitment to this programme will allow this 
good work to continue," said Ms Worth.
