TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   NATIONAL PRESS CLUB ADDRESS  NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………



KEN RANDALL:

Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Welcome to the National Press Club and today’s National Australia  Bank address. It’s my pleasure to welcome back Tony Abbott. He’s been here many times before, but  circumstances are rather different today. Three and a half days until polling day. We’ve already had one  closing address from the Leader of the Nationals, who’s disappeared onto what one of his predecessors used  to call the wombat track. But this week three party leaders, starting of course with today’s address by Tony  Abbott. Please welcome the Leader of the Opposition.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks very much, President Ken Randall and ladies and gentlemen. Let me say that every election is  important but this particular election is unique. This election doesn’t just pit a party of the centre right  against a party of the centre left. It pits a party that built a record surplus against a party that’s responsible  for record deficits. It pits a party which paid back $96 billion in government debt in 10 years against one  which is running up $90 billion of government debt in just five years. It pits a party which respects its leader  against one that assassinated the elected Prime Minister at the first dip in the opinion polls. It pits a party run  by its members of parliament against one that’s controlled by faceless men. It pits a party which has won  control of our borders against a party that has lost control of our borders. It pits a party that respects Cabinet  government against one who’s leaders don’t feel they should necessarily turn up at National Security  Committee meetings.

Ladies and gentlemen, this election is about values and ideas as every election is. But it’s also about proven  capacity to deliver and proven incapacity to deliver. Because ladies and gentlemen, anyone can stand up  during an election campaign and make grand promises. At this very lectern just three years ago Kevin Rudd,  the then Opposition Leader, made lots of grand promises. He promised that students would by now be  pouring from Labor’s Trades Training Centres. He promised that there would by now be almost a million  computers in Australian schools. He promised that by now homes would be linked to high-speed broadband.  He promised that hospitals would be better and if they weren’t better they would be controlled by the  Commonwealth and he promised a national emissions trading scheme. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we all  know what’s happened to Kevin Rudd and we all know what’s happened to those promises and it’s no  wonder, given that, that Labor is running such a relentlessly negative campaign. Because they have no  record to run on except record debt, record deficits, record boats, record backflips and getting rid of an  elected Prime Minister in record time.

But, there is this expectation that voters will give governments a second chance. So let me deal with that  now. It was the Rudd Government and not the Gillard Government that the people elected in 2007. It was  Kevin 07 that people were asked to vote for then and I say why should people respect the Government that  was elected in 2007 when that Government didn’t respect itself enough to keep its own leader? Let’s  consider the Labor Party and what it’s asked us to do. The Labor Party asked people to elect Mark Latham  back in 2004. They asked us to elect Kevin Rudd in 2007. We know what’s happened to both of them. Now  they want us to elect Julia Gillard as Prime Minister. But how can the public be sure that the Labor Party  knows what it’s doing this time when obviously they didn’t know what they were doing the last two times?  And how can Julia Gillard guarantee to serve a full term in the prime ministership if elected when she can’t  be sure that the faction leaders will let her? Why should people give the Government a second chance when  the Government wouldn’t give Kevin Rudd a second chance and why should people trust Julia Gillard when  even Kevin Rudd couldn’t?

Ladies and gentlemen, this election ought not turn on comparative trivia such as how people handle debates,  or how people handle community forums. This election should turn on who would be the most competent  people with the best policies to run our country for the next three years and let’s not forget that just eight  weeks ago this Government had lost its way. We have no better authority for that statement than the  Government itself. The new Prime Minister said just eight weeks ago that the government had lost its way  and of course she was right. The Government had lost its way. It had broken promises. There were 2,628  undelivered Trades Training Centres. There were 222 undelivered child care centres. There were 32 GP  super clinics that were not fully operational and there were 700,000 undelivered computers to Australian  schools. It hadn’t just broken promises it had massively squandered taxpayers’ money. The Government  spent $1.5 billion putting 240,000 dodgy or dangerous insulations into peoples’ homes. It had spent the best  part of $16 billion giving halls to schools that wanted libraries and libraries to schools that wanted halls, at  prices up to three times greater than the industry standard. Yet the interesting thing is that the Deputy Prime  Minister, who could not be trusted adequately to manage and to supervise a $16 billion spending  programme, now wants to be promoted to Prime Minister to manage a $350 billion annual budget and to  preside over a $1.3 trillion Australian economy. Finally, the Government had clobbered Australia’s most  successful industry with a proposal for the world’s highest taxes and even before Labor’s mining tax has  been implemented, it’s already done massive damage. In just one year Australia has plunged 13 places in the  world rankings as a safe place to do business in mining. We now rank, this is Australia, we now rank behind  Argentina, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Namibia and Botswana as a safe place to invest in mining thanks to  the actions of this Government and this from a Government which claims to be a good economic manager.

But ladies and gentlemen, bad as it was just eight weeks ago it’s just got worse since Julia Gillard has been  the Prime Minister. Julia Gillard was going to fix the mining tax but it would still, even in its amended form,  give Australia the highest mining tax rates in the world and even in its amended form it would still destroy  investment and jobs. Julia Gillard was going to fix the boat people problem, but somehow her solution got  lost somewhere in the Timor Sea and still the boats just keep coming. In fact, there have been more illegal  boat people arrive in this country in the course of this election campaign than arrived in the five years  between 2002 and 2007 under the former Government. And finally ladies and gentlemen, Julia Gillard was  going to fix climate change. But in fact she’s now shunted this off to a giant focus group, a kind of political  version of Big Brother where 150 people will be locked up for 12 months and lectured to and whatever  emerges from that is supposed to determine the country’s approach to climate change. She has adopted this  shameless fudge because she’s frightened to admit that putting a price on carbon, which she has repeatedly  called for since becoming Prime Minister, must mean an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax if the  Labor Party is re-elected to government.

So ladies and gentlemen, if the Government is re-elected everyone should know what this would mean.  Everyone should know what will follow if the Government is re-elected. There will be a mining tax, only it  will almost certainly be a heavier and more burdensome tax than the one that the Government is currently  proposing, because that’s what the Greens want and the Greens will control the Senate thanks to the secret  deal that the Labor Party has done with them and the Labor Party cannot afford to lose the revenue that the  mining tax will bring. There will be a carbon tax after the election because Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister,  wants a carbon price. Bob Brown says that the carbon tax will be the first item of discussion between

himself and the Prime Minister should the Government be returned. The faceless men, vindicated, will be  entrenched in the heart of the most important government in our country. Kevin Rudd will have a senior role  in a re-elected Gillard Government, but not so senior that the leaks against the Prime Minister could be  expected to stop. And ladies and gentlemen, should the Government be re-elected the Parramatta to Epping  railway line won’t be built any time in the next decade, making this the third occasion at least when this  particular railway line has been announced but not commenced and bringing to $30 billion the value of rail  projects announced but not delivered by the New South Wales Labor Government. That’s what will happen,  ladies and gentlemen, if the Government is returned.

By contrast, everyone knows what will happen if the Coalition is elected. We will end the waste. We will  end the waste by immediately suspending Building the Education Revolution payments that don’t go  directly to schools. We will repay the debt by spending less and borrowing less than Labor and more will be  announced in the next 36 hours by my colleagues Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb on this subject. We will  stop the big new taxes and we will allow our miners and our electricity generators to plan, confident that  there will be no big new taxes hanging over them and we will stop the boats by establishing within weeks a  processing centre on Nauru. On day one, ladies and gentlemen, I will make the government tighten its belt  so that the Australian public don’t so much have to tighten theirs. On day one I will pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru and I will suspend the wasteful government spending. In month one I will release all of  the modelling and associated work connected with the Henry Review and we will commence the real debate  on tax reform that Australia needs to deliver the lower, simpler, fairer taxes that Australians need. After a  term, ladies and gentlemen, of a Coalition government tax reform will be coming. Tax reform will be  coming starting with a 1.5 per cent company tax cut. Tax reform will be coming, designed to ensure that  there is always incentive to work especially for people who might otherwise become trapped in the welfare  system.

In the first term of a Coalition Government there will be real action on climate change, building up to a $1  billion a year investment in more productive soils and in more trees. There will be a standing green army,  15,000 strong, to support the efforts of farmers, National Parks workers and volunteers in preserving our  environment. There will be better hospitals with more beds and with community boards running them and  there will be better schools with better teachers teaching in them who are paid more. In three years time  there will be a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme and that will be good for women who will finally  have a real choice when it comes to family and paid work. That will be good for families, particularly when  they are at their most financially vulnerable and it will certainly be good for our economy. Because what our  economy needs is greater population, greater participation and greater productivity.

There will be, in the first term of a Coalition government, a Seniors Employment Incentive Payment so that  employers will not be discouraged by our culture from taking on people over 50 and keeping them in work  and finally, ladies and gentlemen, to complete these vital participation reforms there will be new policies to  support young people to take a job. We will pay a relocation allowance of up to $6,000 for people on benefit  who move to take a job. But, ladies and gentlemen, to get a fair go you’ve got to give a fair go. So people  who take this relocation allowance and who leave their job within six months without good reason won’t be  able to return to welfare for six months. We will pay a commitment bonus to young people who’ve been  unemployed for more than 12 months, who take a job and who stay continuously off welfare for 12 or for 24  months. In addition, we will support Andrew Forrest’s Australian Employment Covenant with the job  training packages needed to support indigenous jobseekers who take these guaranteed jobs and we will seek  to extend the Covenant to other long-term unemployed people who are not indigenous. And I have to say,  ladies and gentlemen, that the inspiration for these important participation reforms does not come so much  from my great political mentors and former colleagues John Howard and Peter Costello, important though  they are. The inspiration for this comes from Noel Pearson and the people working with Noel. Noel Pearson  who has been undoubtedly the gutsiest and the most visionary social thinker of modern Australia and the  beneficiaries of these policies, I hope, will be some of the young people that I had the chance to work with  in Cape York in 2008 at Coen School and 2009 at Aurukun School who deserve a better deal than that which  has been given to their parents.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is part of my big ambition for our country. To complete a reform journey. To  shoulder the duty of every Australian government. To build on the reforms, the successful reforms, of the  past three decades. My ambition is for us to make the journey from welfare state to opportunity society. An  opportunity society which preserves the comprehensive safety net but which eliminates the cancer of passive  welfare which has caused intergenerational welfare to become a tragic way of life for too many of our fellow  Australians. I want to have everyone to have the opportunity to step out of passive welfare and to become  participants in an opportunity society. That is part of my vision for a bigger, better Australia. Ladies and  gentlemen, my vision for Australia is not simply that my dreams will be writ large, far from it. My vision is  of an Australia where everyone’s dreams can be better realised. I don’t envisage an Australia where people  conform to a vision that government has created for them. I envisage an Australia where government helps  individuals and communities to better realise their best selves.

I say to everyone who feels disappointed and betrayed by the current Government, there is a better way. I  say to everyone who feels dismayed by the incompetence of the current Government, that it doesn’t have to  be like this. Ladies and gentlemen, my team won’t have to learn on the job because they’ve done the job  before and they’ve done it well. 15 members of my Shadow Cabinet have already been ministers in a  government. Seven members of my Shadow Cabinet were in fact Cabinet Ministers in the most effective  government in recent Australian history.

Finally, let me say to the Australian people, this election is not about the Government and the soap opera  that the Labor Party has become. This election, I say to the Australian people, is about you, your families  and our country's future. You don't owe this Government anything, so don't be taken in by the plea that  you've got to give it a second chance. That, in fact, is the real risk that Australia faces at this election, the  risk that a really bad Government might be given the second chance that it doesn't deserve and that Australia  can't afford. I say to the Australian people why should voters feel squeamish about changing the government  when the Government itself felt no compunction whatsoever about removing the Prime Minister, removing  the Prime Minister without pity or mercy?

So, let me say to my fellow Australians, this is an important election and it does offer the Australian people  a clear choice. If you want to stop the boats, you've got to change the government. If you want to stop the  big new taxes, you've got to change the government. If you want less factions, less pork-barrelling, if you  want less leadership tension, you've got to change the government and if you want to change the  government, you've got to change your local Labor member of Parliament.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are a great people and we are a great country, but we have been let down by our  Government. My mission is to give this great country the better government that it deserves. Thanks very  much. I look forward to talking to you again on many subsequent occasions.

KEN RANDALL:

Thank you very much, Tony Abbott. We still have a few occasions to exchange views today with our  question time starting today with a question from Phillip Hudson.

PHILLIP HUDSON:

Good afternoon, Mr Abbott. Phillip Hudson from the Herald Sun. You just outlined then when you spoke  about your vision for Australia's future. I'm wondering, do you expect after Queen Elizabeth's reign there  will be fresh momentum for a republic, whoever is in power, and that they will have to put the question  again to the public, and can you see Australia ever becoming a republic one day?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Phil, as you know, there has been a lot of pressure over the years for change. I think the first person  who wanted Australia become a republic was John Dunmore Lang back in the 1850s, who wrote a book  called Freedom and Independence for the Golden Lands of Australia. So this republican cause has been with

us for a long time, but the Australian people have demonstrated themselves to be remarkably attached to  institutions that work. Now, I think that our existing constitutional arrangements have worked well in the  past. I see no reason whatsoever why they can't continue to work well in the future. So while there may very  well be further episodes of republicanism in this country, I am far from certain that at least in our lifetimes  there is likely to be any significant change.

KEN RANDALL:

Thank you. The next question is from Heather Ewart.

HEATHER EWART:

Heather Ewart, 7:30 Report. You referred in your speech to what you've called trivia in terms of all the argy-bargy this week about whether there should be a debate, a community forum or both and so it goes on and  on and on. Aren't you at least partly responsible for that yourself? Will there be a debate and a community  forum or either one this week? Finally, what is your position on debates for the next election campaign,  whether you are elected this   Saturday or not?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well Heather, look, prior to the last election, the then Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd promised that  there would be a debates commission established, and that there would be three debates. Now, I think it's a  great pity that the Labor Party in government did not honour the promise that they made in Opposition. It  was one of the many broken promises that we've had from this Government. Now, I think a debates  commission should be established and I think that we should have as many debates as are appropriate, that  the debates commission, in discussion with the two parties, comes up with and I think importantly, as well  as just debates, there should be more community forums of the type that we had at the Rooty Hill RSL just  this Wednesday, because I think that was, in many ways, a much better and more authentic forum. People  inside the Canberra hothouse, whether they be politicians or journalists, are always talking to each other, but  I think it's good to have the respective party leaders giving an account of themselves to undecided voters and  that's what happened at Rooty Hill and that's what should happen in Brisbane tomorrow night.

My understanding is that the Courier-Mail has organised a community forum along identical lines to that at  the Rooty Hill RSL last week. I will be there. I will turn up to face the people of Queensland and I challenge  the Prime Minister, don't be scared of Queensland, don't be frightened of the wrath of Queenslanders. Face  up to it and deal with it as best you can. Now, I've also said that I'm more than happy to debate the economy  and I'm happy to debate the Prime Minister for half an hour on your channel, Heather, the ABC, our ABC.  I'm happy to debate the Prime Minister for half an hour tonight and if the Prime Minister is concerned that  she might be at a disadvantage because she is in a remote location, I'm happy to ensure that I am also in a  remote location so that we have a level playing field for that debate.

HEATHER EWART:

And the next election campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look I think there should be three debates, but I hope there will also be community forums and I think  they should be presided over by a debates commission as Kevin Rudd promised before the last election.

KEN RANDALL:

Phil Coorey.

PHILLIP COOREY:

Hi Mr Abbott. Phil Coorey from the Sydney Morning Herald. One of the more effective criticisms and  continuous criticisms the Coalition made of Kevin Rudd was that he travelled overseas too much as Prime  Minister. I've got to ask you, if you win the election, will you commit to spending less time in the air  internationally than Mr Rudd if you win and would you, given it was portrayed as a negative by the  Opposition, would you nominate any trips that Rudd used to do regularly that you wouldn't do, like APEC,  United Nations General Assembly. Which bilateral visits would be kicked off the agenda?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think it would be almost impossible to spend as much time out of the country as the former Prime  Minister did. He wasn't known as Kevin 747 for nothing. Having said that, having said that, it is important  for Australia to pull its weight in the world and that will mean that on a fairly regular basis the Prime  Minister will travel, but Australian Prime Ministers should not get above themselves. They are the Prime  Minister of Australia, they are not the Prime Minister of the world and I think you could be confident that I  won't get swollen-headed about my place in the world should I be entrusted by the public with the top office  on Saturday. Look, I'm not going to say what particular meetings Australian Prime Ministers should or  shouldn't go to. Obviously if we have a very substantial contribution to make, we should be there. If  something vitally affects our immediate national interests, we should be there, but I don't think there is a  need for the Prime Minister to be at every international talk fest and certainly my travel patterns will much  more closely reflect John Howard in his first term than Kevin Rudd in his first term, should I elected.

KEN RANDALL:

Question from Karen Middleton.

KAREN MIDDLETON:

Mr Abbott, Karen Middleton from SBS Television. I would like to ask you about your new plan to receive  calls directly from the Navy in the event that a boat arrives, to decide personally whether or not that boat  should be turned back. I would like to ask if you could tell us please what questions you would ask the Navy  in making that decision. If the Navy says that it's unsafe to turn that boat back, would you accept that advice  and allow the boat to continue? Or would you override that advice and turn it away? Doesn't that put a lot of  pressure on the Navy in that situation? And if you would accept the advice how can you keep telling  Australian voters that you will turn the boats back?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Karen, I make no apologies for taking a hands-on role in the problems which afflict our country and if  Prime Minister Gillard had been more hands-on in the Education Revolution programme, we may not have  had the kind of waste and mismanagement that we've seen. If Prime Minister Gillard, as Training Minister,  had been more hands-on in the pink batts programme we might not have had the disasters and the tragedies  which we've seen in that programme. So I make no apologies for wanting to bring a hands-on approach to  the really vital business of government. I wouldn't skip National Security Committee meetings, for instance,  or send my bodyguard or some junior staffer along. I would attend all of those meetings.

On the question of turning around boats, there is a clear chain of command from the naval commander to  NORCOM to the Chief of the Defence Force to the government and already in numerous situations, that  chain of command operates and it is the government's call, whether, for instance, that shots should be fired  in terms of arresting fishing vessels or a matter like that. Now, I'm envisaging exactly the same kind of chain  of command and exactly the same kinds of matters that would currently be referred to the government for  final decision in the future, as we've had in the past, certainly as we've had under the Howard Government.  It was John Howard's decision to turn around the Tampa. That was obviously a very important decision, a

very impactful decision, very important in terms of stopping the flow of boat people and decisions of equal  weight would be handled by me in much the same way.

KEN RANDALL:

Question from Patricia Karvelas.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Hi Mr Abbott. Patricia Karvelas from The Australian newspaper. Last night on the Q&A programme you  said it could take up to 10 years to remove the levy off big business, my chair is falling, the levy off big  business to fund your paid parental leave scheme. That sounds a bit different to what you have previously  said, which is that as soon as the economy is back on track, that we have a surplus, that you would seek to  remove that. Do you stand by that 10 year figure that you mentioned last night? Or was that too much? And  also, on another issue, you've said Malcolm Turnbull would take a senior role in an Abbott government. He  seems to be taking a very strong interest in internet policy and the broadband. Are you likely to appoint him  as Communications Minister if you win on Saturday? Do you think that would be a good role for him? Do  you think he has expertise in that area and is making good arguments for the Opposition and potentially the  government on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Patricia, if I could take the second part of your question first. Look, Malcolm is an extraordinary individual.  He has enormous capacities. He made a great contribution to the Howard Government in its last term. He  has been a very significant member of the Coalition over the last three years. I think he is an adornment to  public life and I'm very proud to have him as part of my team. I've got to say that Malcolm has been an  extremely effective member of our team. I think that he has behaved in an exemplary fashion at all times  since I assumed the leadership of the Party and I want to pay tribute to the great gifts of character which  Malcolm has shown over that period which must have been fairly difficult for him at times. Look, yes, he  will certainly have a senior role in an incoming Coalition government and you won't be surprised if I don't  speculate on what particular role he might have, but a bloke of his talents could play a big role in a range of  different ministries. Now, the other question, Patricia?

Paid parental leave. Look, I think this is an extremely important economic reform, as well as being a  visionary social change, but it does have to be paid for and the point I keep making is that paid parental  leave is not a welfare entitlement, it is a workplace entitlement and it's appropriate that now and for a period  at least, that it be borne by, that cost be borne by a levy on big business. Yes, we would like to eliminate that  levy in time, but the important thing is to get the Budget in good repair so I'm not going to put a time line on  it. I'm just going to say that it will go, it will go eventually, it will go at a time of the government's choosing,  when we believe that the Budget is in good repair. But I also make the point that because we are reducing  company tax from 30 per cent to 28 and a half per cent, the 1.5 per cent paid parental leave levy, except for  the first year of the operation of our scheme, will not actually add to the overall burden of tax, even on big  business. So I think this is a perfectly fair arrangement, and I am very, very proud to be the leader of the first  political party to promise a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. I think it's greatly to the credit of what  might be described as the conservative side of politics that we are prepared to move with the times on this  issue. Our values are enduring. Our values don't change, but our policies will change to reflect the modern  reality of Australian life and I'm very proud of this particular policy.

KEN RANDALL:

A question from Sandra O'Malley.

SANDRA O’MALLEY:

Hello Mr Abbott. Sandra O'Malley from Australian Associated Press. To go back to turning back the boats,  has the Coalition sought any sort of legal advice as to what their liability would be if you took the advice to  turn back, that it was safe to turn back a boat and it sunk and people lost their lives? What kind of moral  responsibility would you feel in that circumstance? Given that you've been very effusive about these public  forums, at Rooty Hill last week only one person mentioned asylum seekers as an issue and that was to take  issue that there was a lack of compassion in the debate. Isn't this just furphy being perpetrated by both the  Government and the Coalition that it is such a big issue in he community?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Sandra I think that the legal position today would be the same as the legal position back in 2001 and  2002, when boats were successfully turned around and lives weren't lost and no great fuss was made. Well,  the legal position would be the same today as it was then and I know the one thing that has substantially  changed is the position of the Prime Minister who, back then, when she was the Shadow Minister for  Immigration said that turning the boats around was an acceptable thing to do under the right circumstances,  and was an important part of actually stopping the flow. Now, on the more general situation of boat people, I  want to make it very clear. I am not critical of boat people as such. I am critical of the Government which  has changed policies to put the people smugglers back into business. My argument is not with boat people as  such. My argument is with a government which has put bad policies in place. I can fully understand why  desperate people living in wretched countries, particularly war torn countries, might think that it would be a  very good thing to come and start a new life in Australia and under the policies of this Government, there  will continue to be a very significant refugee and humanitarian component of our immigration programme,  but it is not truly compassionate to put in place policies that tempt these desperate people to risk their lives  on the open sea. It just isn't. It just isn't. There is a world of difference, Sandra, between people who arrive  safely, with papers by air, and people who arrive unsafely without papers by boat and that's why I think the  public are rightly concerned, to stop this horrible wretched, unsafe business, and let me say in conclusion,  Sandra, that after the launch that the Liberal Party had in Brisbane last Sunday, I was incredibly thrilled to  be greeted by a former refugee from one of the war torn countries of Africa, and what he said to me was,  "Congratulations on your policy because we shouldn't support queue-jumping, and we shouldn't support  people smuggling," and that's my position.

KEN RANDALL:

Next question is from Alex Hart.

ALEX HART:

Mr Abbott, Alex Hart from the Seven Network. What action will be taken against your candidate for  Robertson Darren Jameson over claims he allegedly manhandled a group of children on the campaign trail?

TONY ABBOTT:

Alex, I make two points. First of all, my understanding is that action against Darren Jameson has been  dropped and my understanding is that that all he sought to do was to try to prevent potentially unsafe  activity, namely kids throwing objects at passing cars. Now, not an unreasonable thing for a policeman or a  former policeman to do, and, as I said, my understanding is that the whole matter has been dropped by the  police. Look, just on the subject of people behaving inappropriately or appropriately as the case may be, I  note that there have been all sorts of accusations made against candidates. There was apparently a situation  where a Labor candidate in a Queensland seat actually punched out an elderly man at a race meeting. I just  want to make the point that all forms of violence and intimidation are completely unacceptable. They're  unacceptable to me, they should be unacceptable to the Prime Minister, but my understanding is that Darren  Jameson is completely in the clear. I'm not so sure about Labor's candidate in the seat of Dawson and I call  on the Prime Minister to look at that matter and to say what action she thinks is appropriate, given what  seems to have happened with that particular candidate.

KEN RANDALL:

A question from Laura Tingle.

LAURA TINGLE:

Laura Tingle from The Financial Review, Mr Abbott. I notice that some of your spokesmen, when talking  about the Labor proposal for a National Broadband Network have described it as a Rolls Royce proposal and  that you're looking at a more affordable proposal. My question to you is, why can we not afford a Rolls  Royce broadband system, but we can apparently afford a Rolls Royce paid parental leave system? In your  policy documents, you justify going to this scheme by looking at what other countries do, including Greece  and Spain which I would note are in fairly bad financial trouble, and you've just told us that you're not going  to put a time limit on removing the levy for paying for it. Doesn't that suggest that we can't actually afford  the scheme you're proposing?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, it doesn't, Laura, and the scheme that I'm proposing is not so dramatically different from schemes that  operate in many other countries. Many other countries have schemes which provide women or the principal  carer with six months or in some cases more time off with the newborn at the carer's, normally the mother's,  actually wage. Not so unusual at all. So I think that what we're talking about here is catching up with the rest  of the world, importantly catching up with the rest of the world. What I think the current government is  proposing with National Broadband Network is way in excess of anything that’s being proposed anywhere  in the world. I mean, what's being the current Government is a $43 billion investment, without even a  business plan. That's $5,000 per household. Now, this is about seven times the public investment proposed  by any other country. It's vastly in excess. It is a multiple of what's proposed what's proposed in New  Zealand, it is a multiple of what's proposed in South Korea and it is a massive multiple of what's proposed in  Singapore, and these are countries which are often cited as countries which have the ideal approach to  broadband. Look, you know, it's really a massive hit on peoples’ future, and this $5,000, that's just to build  it, that's before you've got to pay to use it. It's $5,000, which is just going to go onto our debt, which, as we  know is increasing at $100 million a day, every day. Look, I am all in favour of national broadband, but I  don't like the idea of nationalised broadband. I think that competitive markets are far more likely to give us a  good system than a government monopoly, and what we need is an affordable broadband system, not this  blue-skies proposal which the Government has given, and which if the Government's record is anything to  go by, won't be delivered on time and on budget.

KEN RANDALL:

Question from Paul Bongiorno.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

Paul Bongiorno, Ten News, Mr Abbott. Peter Costello in his memoirs at page 55 says, "Tony always saw  himself as something of a romantic figure, a Don Quixote, ready to take on lost causes and fight for great  principals, never one to be held back by the financial consequences of decisions. He had plans for public  expenditure." He also goes on to say that he was horrified when you told him that you learnt your economics  at the feet of Bob Santamaria. You say that we must judged you on your performance in government. Isn't a  fact that in government as Health Minister your Medicare safety net in 2004 was costed at $495 million over  four years, by the end of the first year, it was costing $1 billion? And the 2006 better access scheme for  mental health was costed at $538 million over five years. In three years, it’s come in at $732 million.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Paul. If I may say so, you don't fully appreciate the nature of Medicare. Medicare is a demand-driven  programme. If people need the services, the subsidy is available, and particularly when it comes to mental

health, I'm very happy to see that the Government of which I was a proud member, put in place better access  to mental health services, policies which did in fact mean that a lot more Australians got access to  psychologists' treatment under mental health care plans under Medicare than had previously been the case.  So, look, I am happy to see a greater investment in mental health, and I'm pleased that the policies that I put  in place have been responsible for better mental health care and I'm pleased to build on that with the $1.5  billion mental health package that we’ve announced shortly before this campaign started, which has been  very broadly supported by mental health experts, including the Australian of the Year, Professor Pat  McGorry, and I challenge the Government, even at this late stage, to do something similar for people with  mental health problems. Now, you know Peter, my friend, my colleague, in some respects my mentor, he  has a great turn of phrase, and one of the points that I've been making to Peter Costello is that just as he has  changed, I've changed. Once upon a time, it might have been my tendency to channel the late great BA  Santa Maria. These days when I'm not channelling Noel Pearson, I'm channelling Peter Costello.

KEN RANDALL:

Here’s Malcolm Farr.

MALCOLM FARR:

G;’day, Malcolm Farr, The Daily Telegraph. Accepting that in industrial relations you would maintain a no-disadvantage test, do you think that the Australian economy would benefit from the introduction of  individual employment contracts similar to the former Australian workplace agreements?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Malcolm, the current legislation has something called a better-off-all-round test, and as you know, I  am committed to preserving the current legislation, and let me just repeat again, not just for the benefit of  this room, but for anyone watching this broadcast, that I have spent a lot of time over the last few months  talking to people around our country, particularly small businesses around our country, and the message that  I get from them is that, sure, the current legislation might be imperfect in this small respect or that small  respect, but far more important than changing the legislation or changing the system, given all the upheaval  we've had in this area in the last two decades, is stability and certainty. So, that's what people will get in this  area from me - stability and certainty. The people who want more workplace relations change at this election  are not the Coalition, but the Labor Party.

KEN RANDALL:

Question from Michelle Grattan The Age.

MICHELLE GRATTAN:

Michelle Grattan from The Age. Mr Abbott, one of the controversial actions early in the Howard  Government was to axe from their jobs a third of the public service heads. Would you care to give a  guarantee that you will not repeat that sort of exercise if you win government? And also speaking of  channelling Noel Pearson, you have praised him very highly on a number of occasions. How would you  seek to involve him or use his skills, and what about former Prime Minister John Howard who is out there  campaigning for you, would you use his skills in any fashion if you won government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Michelle, look, I would be only too happy to continue to talk to and be inspired by both of the  gentlemen that you mentioned, and I would be only too happy to look at a appropriate ways of making the  best possible use of the talents and the inspiration and the insights of someone like Noel Pearson, but I  certainly haven't spoken to him about any particular job in government. I'm not getting ahead of myself,  Michelle. I've got an election to win, but you can be confident that I will maintain close dialogue with Noel

Pearson, in particular. I will have strong dialogue, I hope, with a number of key Indigenous leaders, but  certainly I’d want to have strong dialogue with Noel Pearson. Look, you know, I think that it's easy to be a  public servant-basher until you've actually worked with senior levels of the Australian Public Service, and I  worked very closely with the Australian Public Service throughout the life of the Howard Government, and  I've got to say that they are a remarkable group of people. Highly dedicated, highly professional, and very  effective in implementing the policy of the government of the day. We are lucky to have a highly  professional public service that still preserves most of the best aspects of the Westminster tradition. I want to  cherish that and nurture it. I don't want radically to change it. I think there could usefully be a little more  interchange between the public service and business at senior levels, but the last thing that I would want to  do is to disturb the public service to engage in public service upheaval. Let's face it, Michelle, nearly all of  the senior public servants who are working for the current government and working effectively and  professionally for the current government, worked effectively and professionally for the former government,  including for me. So, I think that people can assume that as far as humanly possible, there will be stability  and continuity in the Australian Public Service should there be a change of government.

KEN RANDALL:

Andrew Probyn.

ANDREW PROBYN:

Mr Abbott, Andrew Probyn from the West Australian. You've talked relentlessly in recent months about  government debt and deficit. I note that today you’ve raised the prospect of infrastructure bonds which is  another way of issuing taxpayer debt, I suppose. Now, the question is when is government debt good and  when is it bad? And is it good when the, say, the Government argues that debt has saved jobs? Secondly, do  you think that Chinese companies are taking too much control of Australian mining interests? And if so,  what changes would you make to the FIRB arrangements?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Andrew, the infrastructure bonds that we talked about today are certainly not government debt. What  we talked about today was providing a tax incentive for private individuals and entities that invest in  infrastructure projects that are approved by Infrastructure Australia. So, it is a tax break to make private  investment in infrastructure more advantageous and attractive. That's what we're talking about. We are  trying ensure that we get the infrastructure we need more quickly. That's what we're trying to do. We're not  talking about adding to government debt, we're talking about providing more opportunities for private  investment in the infrastructure that Australia needs, and all of this would be closely supervised by  Infrastructure Australia, and the tax rebates involved would be capped at $150 million a year. It's rebates  we're talking about, not government debt, not the guarantee, the government guarantee of private debt. Now,  on the subject Chinese investment. Look, we need to understand that China doesn't operate the way  Australia does. I'm not making value judgments, I'm just stating a fact. A Chinese business is much more an  arm of the Chinese Government than an Australian business would normally be an arm of the Australian  Government. I would not normally be in favour of Australian Government entities taking a majority position  in Australian businesses, and similarly, I would be very careful about majority ownership of Australian  assets by government-controlled entities, and I'm not singling out China here, I hasten to add, I'm just  making a general comment that I believe in the free market, I believe in private enterprise above all else, and  I don't particularly want to see nationalisation of businesses by Australia, let alone nationalisation of  Australian businesses by other countries' governments, or by entities controlled by countries' governments.  That said, we need foreign investment, we welcome Chinese foreign investment, but it does have to go  through the ordinary Foreign Investment Review Board rules. Essentially, it is a national interest test. That  national interest test is very flexibly applied, and I wouldn't envisage in this instance any changes in the  rules as they currently operate.

KEN RANDALL:

Mark Kenny.

MARK KENNY:

Mark Kenny, Mr Abbott from the Adelaide Advertiser. You spent a bit of time at the end of your speech  saying to voters that they don't owe this government anything, and ask why should voters feel squeamish  about changing government when in fact the Labor Party hasn't been squeamish about changing its leader…

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m pleased that you were paying such close attention to my speech, Mark.

MARK KENNY:

Does that tell us something about the research that you have, that the biggest hurdle you have now is a kind  of voter conservativism, ironically, that voters tend to give a give a government a second chance? Just  quickly if I may, you also said when you're not channelling Peter Costello, you're channelling Noel Pearson.  There has been a bit of talk during this election that both leaders have been very protective and cautious and  we haven't seen the real Julia Gillard all the time, and we haven't seen the real Tony Abbott. When do you  channel Tony Abbott? Is that after the election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, can I say, I'm not pretending to make impromptu speech. I have notes and here they are. Was it  the real Julia that pretended that the speech was extempera or some other Julia? Look, I think that there is a  record that we're running against. I mean, it's 79 years, Mark, since a first-term incumbent government was  defeated, and I'm very conscious of that record that we're running against. I'm very conscious of that history  that we're running against. I'm very conscious of the fact that this Government is throwing the kitchen sink  at us. I'm conscious of the extraordinary weight of advertising, not just from the Government, but from the  ACTU which is now on the airwaves, so I'm very conscious of all the hurdles that the Coalition has to leap  over in order to win this election, and I just want to make sure that the bad habit, if that's what it is, of  automatically giving governments a second chance isn't yet another one of those hurdles that we've got to  leap over. So that’s what I’m doing. I'm not reflecting research, I'm simply reflecting what I think is the  reality, that it is difficult for first-term oppositions to beat first-term governments, but having said all that, I  cannot remember a first-term government which has so little to talk about, positive, at the end of its first  term than this government, and I say again, Mark, if this government was any good, it would not have  politically executed its own Prime Minister. The ultimate indictment of this government is the fact that its  own members saw fit to politically execute its own leader.

KEN RANDALL:

Question from Danielle Cronin.

DANIELLE CRONIN:

Hi Mr Abbott. Danielle Cronin from the Canberra Times. Former Prime Minister John Howard's decision to  live in Kirribilli rather than Canberra and use the VIP to travel between left our taxpayers with about a  $200,000 annual bill. When Kevin Rudd was Opposition Leader, he vowed to stay in the Lodge to save  taxpayer money. Are you prepared to do that? Why or why not?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Danielle, I have been asked a few times this question and I've constantly said that I don't want to get  ahead of myself, and that's still my position. I've got to say that instinctively I’d probably prefer to live in  Forrestville than in The Lodge or Kirribilli House because I think that the best government is a government

which, as far as is humanly possible, shares the ordinary life of the Australian people. So, that would be my  instinct. On the other hand, I do appreciate that there are certain official duties, there are certain official  burdens, there are certain difficulties, I guess, that senior members of a government have to live with, and  that might make it impossible to continue to hang around in suburban Forrestville. Look, I'm just not going  to say any more this than that, other than that I am always very conscious of trying to avoid being a burden  on the taxpayer, and I would try not to do anything voluntarily that would add to the burdens on the  taxpayer.

KEN RANDALL:

One more question today. It's from Lenore Taylor.

LENORE TAYLOR:

The electricity generation industry says that without a carbon price it will soon start investing in stop-gap  technologies that will push up the price of power without any big cuts in emissions. Given that your climate  fund will only maybe be able to fund one replacement power plant, are you worried that you will preside  over higher electricity prices without any climate gain and could I please ask you to answer with reference to  your own policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure. Lenore, my policy is not to put any additional burdens on power generation. My policy is not to have  an emissions trading scheme. My policy is not to have a carbon tax because either an emissions trading  scheme or a carbon tax are designed to raise the price of electricity, are designed to be a burden on  consumers, and I don't want to put more burdens on consumers. So, look, if the Coalition is elected, there  will be no additional price placed on the production of electricity. We will secure our emissions reduction  targets by purchasing abatements directly from the Budget. That's how we will do it. So if the electricity  generators want certainty, they can have the certainty of a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme under  the government. That will drive up their costs. That will raise the costs to consumers. Or they can have the  certainty of no emissions trading scheme, no carbon price under us, that won't add to their burdens, and  won't add to the prices that consumers face. So, look, I can't make myself clearer than that. I think that the  best carbon price faced by consumers and generators is zero.

KEN RANDALL:

Thank you very much.
