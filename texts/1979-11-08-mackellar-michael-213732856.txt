VIETNAMESE STOWAWAYS TAKEN ASHORE

"The nine Vietnamese stowaways brought to Australia

by the Greek registered vessel the 'Dimitris LF' are being

taken from the vessel", the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

Affairs Mr. MacKellar said today. .

.  Mr. MacKellar said that the Australian Government

had acted in accordance with Australian law and international

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  practice, regarding the situation of the stowaways as being

the responsibility of— the master of the vessel and the

Government of the country where the vessel is registered.

An approach had been made to the Greek Government .

for a guarantee for the resettlement of the Vietnamese and

discussions were continuing. In making the approach the

Australian Government had noted statements by Greek

Government representatives at international meetings in March

and July this year recording the Greek Government's decision .

to issue guarantees for refugees rescued at sea enabling them

to disembark at their first port of call. To be meaningful

the guarantee must relate to resettlement underwritten by

Greece.

Mr. MacKellar said that while the situation of

the nine Vietnamese was that of stowaways and not persons

rescued at sea, the Government believed that the guarantees

given publicly this year applied in respect of stowaways.

The decision to take the stowaways from the

vessel was in keeping with Australia's recognition of the

humanitarian and international consideration in a situation

of this kind.

"For its part, the Australian Government has

accepted and met a commitment to guarantee resettlement

of persons rescued at sea by Australian registered vessels.

This has applied even where the Australian registered

vessel was not manned by an Australian crew and there was little

direct connection with Australia".

Mr. MacKellar said that further action would be

taken in accordance with Australian law and any further

obligations which might apply to the situation of the

nine Vietnamese.

Discussions with the Greek Government and UNHCR

would continue.
