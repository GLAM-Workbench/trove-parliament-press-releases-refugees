Cowper Community Survey: The final results

Residents across the Cowper electorate have sent a very clear message on  what are the important issues and what should be the focus of the Federal  Government, Federal MP Luke Hartsuyker said today.

Releasing the final results of his Cowper Community Survey Mr Hartsuyker  said North Coast residents had made their views very clear.

“I received more than 4,100 responses and they detailed their view on a range  of subjects,” Mr Hartsuyker said.

“As I have previously noted the Pacific Highway was clearly the number one  infrastructure priority with 76 per cent of respondents saying they believe it  should be the funding priority. Local roads came in second with 12 per cent.

“Only two per cent of respondents said the National Broadband Network   should be the priority. And 79 per cent said that funds be spent on the Pacific  Highway rather than the NBN.”

Mr Hartsuyker said there was also some other telling statistics including:

Carbon Tax: 64 per cent are completely opposed to the carbon tax and  another 13 per cent said it should be delayed. 90 percent expressed concern  about the increase cost of electricity

Cost of living: 93 per cent said it is costing them more to live than 12 months  ago with 70 per cent saying it is costing more than $20 per week and 28 per  cent saying it is costing more than $40 per week. 37.3 per cent blamed the  Federal Government for the rise in the cost of living, with 21.7 per cent  blaming the State Government and 14.4 per cent local government.

Health: 48 per cent said they were satisfied with the service they received  from their local hospital. 82 per cent said they were able to access a doctor.  59 per cent said they opposed the government’s cut to the private health care  rebate

Broadband: 21 per cent said their broadband speeds don’t meet their needs,  while 65 per cent said they would not be willing to pay more for increased  speeds.

Education: 75 per cent said that school principals should have more control  over their schools, including recruitment and retention of staff. 71 per cent  said more funding should be provided to young people who have to move  away from home to study.

Border Protection: 73 per cent believe the Labor Government was wrong to  change the law on asylum seekers.

Economic management: 75 per cent felt the economy was not being well  managed by the  Gillard Government. 80 per cent expressed concern about  rising Federal Government debt while 74 per cent said the government should

not continue to borrow more funds. 83 percent said they were ‘worried’ or  ‘very worried’ about the current economic circumstances

Local Government: 54 per cent opposed the removal of rate pegging to allow  councils to provide better services. Only 18 per cent supported the idea.

“I thank all those people who responded to the survey.

“What is very pleasing is that the key issues identified by constituents are the  same issues which I am focussed on.”
