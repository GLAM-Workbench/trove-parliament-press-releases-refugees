It is a pleasure to speak tonight about the future of East Timor.

East Timor has been a major preoccupation for me as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, first with the 1997 rewriting of Labor's platform in favour of East Timorese self-determination, then with the fall of Suharto in 1998, and subsequently with the tumultuous events of 1999.

Over the past eighteen months, I have visited East Timor four times. Having previously been prevented from visiting the territory by the Indonesian authorities, I first visited East Timor as a member of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation that observed the conduct of the 30 August ballot. I returned for a second visit with Kim Beazley in November last year as INTERFET worked to establish security and handle the humanitarian emergency which followed the post-ballot violence. I have visited Dili twice this year, most recently for the ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the ballot. I anticipate visiting East Timor at least once more before next year's federal election.

Nearly fourteen months have now passed since East Timor's vote for independence. Having for so long been denied their right to self-determination, the East Timorese are well on their way to independent statehood. Indeed an independent and sovereign East Timor is likely to come into being at the end of next year, little more than another fourteen months from now.

Driven by East Timorese expectations and the realities of international support for the UN administration, the rapid movement toward full independence brings with it enormous challenges.

Very few countries have suffered the level of destruction experienced last year with virtually their entire infrastructure systematically and comprehensively destroyed by the Indonesian military and pro-autonomy militias. The emergency phases of the UN's operations are now largely over. But that still leaves a very great number of East Timorese living in the most dire of circumstances. The reconstruction task is enormous. As Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Guterres observed earlier this year:

The problem is not only the physical destruction, which is impressive, more than I imagined, but the destruction of an economy and the breakdown of a society. No experience exists in rebuilding a society which has been destroyed in this manner and with such a fragile economic and educational base. This is why there is an enormous job to do.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

And on top of all this, there is the challenge of building the democratic institutions required to serve an independent state, and do so within little more than twelve months from now.

Fourteen months on from the ballot, more than 100,000 East Timorese remain in refugee camps in West Timor, subject to intimidation and denied their right to make a free choice about their future.

In September, we saw a sharp deterioration in security and an escalation of violence in West Timor, most highlighted by the murders of three UNHCR staff in Atambua on 6 September.

A month later, we have seen some Indonesian action to disarm the militias and bring them under control. A number of weapons have been seized and the notorious Enrico Guetteres has been arrested. But there is still a long way to go before a satisfactory situation is achieved.

Speaking to the UN Security Council last month, UNTAET administrator Sergio de Mello gave a less than optimistic assessment of the prospects for resolving this problem. He said, and I quote:

I must be frank and state that first of all the Indonesian authorities have to acknowledge and confront the fact that it is their responsibility alone to address this threat. We all realise that the militias are not the creation of the administration of President Wahid and that they do not act on instructions from the Government in Jakarta; we sympathise with the dreadful legacy with which the authorities have been left from previous policies towards East Timor. Nonetheless, the repercussions are likely to be more unrest and loss of innocent lives in West and East Timor unless the root of the problem is recognised and eradicated.

Regrettably, I remain skeptical that current activities will achieve this goal. Where resolution and a certain degree of ruthlessness would seem to be required, we are witnessing hesitation and prevarication. … What is required is a coordinated, integrated and comprehensive strategy on the part of the Indonesian security forces, together with the necessary will, to hunt down and break up the militias and bring their leaders to justice. And for that … we are still waiting.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

That was Sergio de Mello at the end of last month. We are still waiting today. The UN High Commission for Refugees and other international agencies and NGOs have not been able to return to West Timor.

International pressure on Indonesia has grown since the Atambua murders. In the context of the meeting of the Consultative Group on Indonesia in Tokyo today and tomorrow, the United States and United Kingdom have warned Indonesia that it risks losing foreign aid if it does not act decisively to disarm and disband the militias. But at the same time, we have also seen a hardening of Indonesian political opinion against what they see as foreign interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. Indeed we now have seen Enrico Guetteres being embraced as a patriot and hero by senior Indonesian parliamentarians.

The extent of any continuing Indonesian military support for the militias remains unclear. What is absolutely clear, however, is the absence of decisive action by the Indonesian authorities to resolve this problem.

It appears likely that the East Timor will continue to face a substantial security problem along its western border. Militia incursions into East Timor may persist for quite some time with a consequent continuing requirement for a UN peacekeeping presence.

Within East Timor the reconstruction task still has a long way to go. Although much rebuilding has taken place, a large part of Dili's central business area remains in ruins, its redevelopment hampered by ownership disputes, often involving property acquired illegally during Indonesia's administration.

The general housing situation has greatly improved, particularly in the capital where most dwellings have at least been temporarily repaired. Most power stations and other utilities are again in operation. Security, food supply and health services have improved, and the medical situation now more comprehensively monitored than ever before.

According to the World Bank East Timor's GNP per capita is now over US$500, but this is probably somewhat inflated by the considerable foreign business activities stimulated by the UN presence. The agriculture sector is reportedly recovering at a brisk pace, and with improved techniques, output should reach record levels in the next year or so. The production of rice still suffers from last year's events, which destroyed a great many irrigation systems.

Over 170,000 children are back in primary schools but serious problems constrain developing the education system, especially a drastic shortage of school staff and basic teaching equipment, the need to redesign the school syllabus, and the reintroduction of Portuguese as the official language, a change strongly resented by students educated to tertiary level in Bahasa Indonesia. The University of East Timor, comprehensively wrecked, has reopened only this month but with only a very limited range of activities.

Despite a range of job creation programs, UNTAET has failed to significantly reduce the massive level of unemployment in urban areas, which is contributing to social unrest, increased petty crime and occasional demonstrations outside UN offices. The contrast between the circumstances of the Timorese, and the incomes and life-styles of UN employees and other foreigners, the ubiquitous presence of white four-wheel drive vehicles, is inevitably cause for discontent and criticism. The new industry of restaurants and hotel accommodation is focused solely on affluent foreigners.

The UN is implementing an agreed interim political structure. Since mid-July, UNTAET has had a new Cabinet structure with eight Cabinet portfolios, four held by East Timorese and four by international UNTAET staff. The Cabinet sets policy and oversees its implementation, thus far deliberating on a wide range of policies. It has agreed a framework for taxation, a criminal procedure code, a public buildings reconstruction plan and a plan to develop legislation for the transport sector. It's working out procedures to resolve land ownership and property disputes and undertaking a comprehensive budget review.

Even more significant is the move to expand and rename the National Consultative Council which UNTAET set up as an advisory body into what will be the foundations of East Timor's parliament. Its membership will increase from 15 to 33, with new members representing districts, women, youth and the Church. In another important step towards "Timorising" the Interim Administration, Timorese District or Deputy District Administrators have been appointed in all thirteen districts of the country.

These measures are all most welcome, and have done much to improve relations between UNTAET and Timorese leaders, but tensions are evident. Speaking last week Xanana Gusmao sharply criticised UNTAET, accusing it of failing to engage the East Timorese more

fully in the transitional process to independence:

We are not interested in a legacy of cars and laws, nor are we interested in a legacy of development plans for the future designed by [people] other than East Timorese. We are not interested in inheriting an economic rationale which leaves out the social and political complexity of East Timorese reality. Nor do we wish to inherit the heavy decision-making and project implementation mechanisms in which the role of the East Timorese is to give their consent as observers rather than the active players we should start to be.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Tensions are also increasing evident between Xanana as President of the umbrella National Council of Timorese Resistance, CNRT, and its constituent parties, notably Fretilin and the Timorese Democratic Union - the UDT. With the establishment of a new Timorese party, the Social Democratic Party, and the forthcoming registration of political parties, we can expect to see a marked intensification of open political activity and discord as East Timor moves towards national elections for a Constituent Assembly in the second half of next year.

Where will East Timor be at the end of next year? Well, hopefully the foundations of a democratic state will have been well laid, but an enormous amount of work remains in developing and strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law.

East Timor's leaders and political parties will only be at the beginning of the challenges of governing an independent and sovereign state. They will have to manage both East Timor's internal development and external relationships including what may well prove to be a difficult bilateral relationship with Indonesia. They will do so at a time when the UN presence in East Timor winds down, but before alternative local sources of revenue are available. Continuing international support - financial and across every sector of government and non-government activity -- will be absolutely vital to bridge this gap and help East Timor advance on a path of sustainable and hopefully self-reliant development.

For Australia's part, we will need to be prepared to provide East Timor with considerable development assistance. East Timor's needs will remain very substantial for a long time to come and the Australian Government is duty bound to be generous in support.

At the same time, we must not neglect the value of people-to-people ties. There is an enormous reservoir of goodwill in Australia towards East Timor. We need to harness and organise this commitment of thousands of Australians in all walks of life. Foreign policy makers increasingly emphasise the importance of a "whole of government" approach to international issues. What we need here is a sustained and well-organised "whole of society" approach.

Australian NGOs are making vital contributions to reconstruction and development. Australian lawyers are committed to help develop East Timor's legal and constitutional system. Australia's local government is committed to help build local administrative structures and community-level organisations. We need to think strategically about all these diverse activities. We need to ensure that they bring the maximum possible benefit and do not peter out over time.

We also need to look at new activities including support for East Timor's political parties to encourage them at every opportunity in their commitment to democratic processes. We need to help build democratic institutions and sustained political commitment to those institutions.

What we need is a community-to-community, democratic partnership with the East Timorese people.

And all along we must constantly be mindful and respectful of East Timor's hard won sovereignty. Australia can help, but at every step East Timor's leaders and people must be completely involved in decision-making. After all East Timor must determine its own future. That is what self-determination is all about.

For the longer term, Australia also needs to adopt a forward thinking approach to the future of the oil and gas resources of the Timor Gap, an approach which takes full account of the development of international maritime law and the importance of advancing East Timor's economic viability and financial independence. Negotiated by Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas, the present 50/50 division of petroleum and gas revenue under the Timor Gap Treaty is the one remaining institutional legacy of Australia's past East Timor policies.

Regrettably it appears the Howard Government may be inclined to take a less than generous approach to East Timor's claims to either a substantially greater share of this petroleum revenue or for a permanent seabed boundary settlement based on lines of equidistance between Australia and East Timor.

In an answer to a parliamentary question last month, the Government asserted: 'Australia's position is that, under international law, Australia's and East Timor's seabed rights extend from their coastlines throughout the natural prolongation of their respective continental shelves, which meet [in the deepest part] of the Timor Trough.' In effect this amounts to a continuation of Australia's historic claim to the entirety of the oil and gas reserves in the Timor Gap. Clearly the Government is conceding nothing at beginning of negotiations. This might be a standard negotiating tactic, but it shows neither real sympathy for East Timor nor foresight about Australia and East Timor's shared interests.

For our part, Labor is prepared to support the negotiation and conclusion of a permanent maritime boundary in the Timor Gap based on lines of equidistance between Australia and East Timor. Such a settlement would place major gas and petroleum reserves within East Timor's maritime boundaries and constitute a just outcome consistent with the Law of the Sea.

Alternatively, should East Timor prefer to continue or modify the existing regime governing the Timor Gap, Labor supports the negotiation of a new agreement for the joint development of these gas and petroleum resources. Such an agreement should ensure continuity and stability for the companies presently operating in the Timor Gap and provide East Timor a substantially greater share of revenue - quite possibly the 90-10 share proposed by East Timorese leaders.

Adopted at our National Conference in Hobart on 3 August, Labor's formula on the Timor Gap is fully consistent with international law and the interests of both Australia and East Timor. It represents an honourable approach and provides a just formula for East Timor. It remains to be seen whether the Howard Government will ultimately be prepared to adopt it in the current Timor Gap negotiations with UNTAET and East Timorese leaders. Given that any settlement will ultimately require legislation which must pass the Labor-Democrat majority in the Australian Senate, they would do well to give Labor's approach positive consideration.

Success for East Timor is not guaranteed. The challenges facing the East Timorese are enormous. But we cannot contemplate failure. In partnership with East Timor's leadership and people, Australia is duty bound to do everything we can to ensure East Timor enjoys a stable and fully independent future.
