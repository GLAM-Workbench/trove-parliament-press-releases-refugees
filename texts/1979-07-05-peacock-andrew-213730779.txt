ANZUS COMMUNIQUE

The ANZUS Council held its 28th meeting in Canberra

on 4 and 5 July, 1979. The Right Hon. Brian Talboys,  Deputy

Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs,  represented

New Zealand; the Hon. Cyrus Vance,  Secretary of State,  represented

the United States; and the Hon. Andrew Peacock,  Minister for

Foreign Affairs,  and the Hon. D.J. Killen, Minister for Defence,

represented Australia.

The Australian and New Zealand Ministers commented that

it gave them added pleasure to welcome the presence of the

Secretary of State of the United States at the meeting on the

anniversary of American independence and extended to him their

warm congratulations. Ã¢ÂÂ -

The Ministers recalled that the annual Council meeting

took place against the background of regular,  extensive and

high level consultations between the partners throughout the

year on matters of mutual interest. They noted in particular

the value of the visits which the Australian and New Zealand

Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers had made to the United

States over the past year. .

The Council noted that, apart from the day to day

practical value of the ANZUS Security Treaty, the Treaty

symbolised a deeper and wider association between three societies

which embodied similar values and shared similar aspirations.

The annual ANZUS Council meetings were thus not only meetings

of allies, but of close friends of long standing. Consistent

with this relationship the Council discussions this year,

as in the past, took place in an informal atmosphere which

2

enabled Ministers to exchange views freely on a very wide

range of foreign policy and defence matters of current concern.

The Council members reaffirmed their strong commitment

to the ANZUS Treaty and the high value which they attached

to the effective military co-operation,  the flow of high

technology and the free exchange of information and strategic

intelligence which it had fostered over the years. They

observed that more than 27 years after the Treaty entered into

force it could be said that it had lost none of its vitality

and relevance to the security concerns of the partners.

The Ministers noted with satisfaction that an active

program of exchanges,  exercises and visits involving all three

services of the three partners was now a continuing feature

of the ANZUS relationship. They noted in particular the value

of combined military exercises such as 1 1  LONG EX" ,  "SANDGROPER",

"RIMPAC" and the "KANGAROO" series,  which both test and improve

the capability of the defence forces of the alliance to operate

effectively together.

The Council members exchanged views on the important

contribution that the supply and support of defence material

by the United States makes to the capacity of the Australian

and New Zealand Defence Forces for self reliant combat

capability and thus to the achievement of broad ANZUS interests

in the region. They agreed that measures should be taken to

arrive at more definitive understandings regarding the provision

of such supply and support in contingent circumstances. They

welcomed initiatives currently under way to further develop

the relevant arrangements among the ANZUS partners.

The Council members pledged their continued efforts

to strengthen the fabric of peace in the Pacific area. They

observed that the ANZUS alliance was an enduring positive

factor in that region. They welcomed the normalisation of

relations between the United States and China and the conclusion

of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship as important

contributions to the strengthening of peace and stability in

the Asia/Pacific area. The Australian and New Zealand Ministers

expressed their strong support for the increasingly close

relations between the United States and Japan, maintenance of

the Unites' States security commitment to the Republic of Â·

Korea and continuing efforts to promote dialogue and reduce

tensions in the area, particularly the joint US-ROK proposal

announced in Seoul on 1 July for an early meeting between

representatives of the South and the North of Korea and

the United States.

The Council welcomed the continuing contribution made

by the Association of South East Asian Nations to the peace

and stability of the region through its growth of political

cohesion and co-operation in regional economic and social

development. Each of the Council members had participated

in recent discussions in Bali with the Foreign Ministers of

the ASEAN countries. .  The Ministers individually reaffirmed

the value of this opportunity to consult with Governments of

the region on matters of mutual concern.

The Council members expressed the deep concern of

their Governments over the conflicts in Indochina and their

effects on the peace arjd stability of South East Asia. They

agreed with the ASEAN Foreign Ministers that there is now a

greater threat of the conflict escalating over a wider area. .

They expressed their support for the independence and territorial

integrity of all states in the region and endorsed the ASEAN

Foreign Ministers' call on Vietnam to demonstrate its positive

attitude towards Thailand and the other ASEAN states by

withdrawing its forces from the Thai/Kampuchean border. The

Council members agreed that every effort should be made to

being about an early end to the fighting and the establishment

of a lasting settlement which fully respected the independence

and territorial integrity of Kampuchea.

The Ministers expressed their sorrow and strong concern

at the vast human suffering caused by the conflicts in Indochina

and Vietnam's actions which disregard accepted norms of internatÂ­

ional behaviour. They agreed with the view expressed by the

ASEAN Foreign Ministers that Vietnam is responsible for the

tragic flood of refugees and has a decisive role to play in

resolving the problem at source. They agreed that while

priority should be placed upon efforts to resolve the refugee

problem at its source the international community, must make

urgent efforts to provide additional humanitarian assistance,

including temporary shelter and permanent resettlement to

the refugees.

Australia and New Zealand joined the United States in

strongly supporting the statement on" refugees from Indochina

issued by the Heads of State and Government at the Tokyo

Summit meeting on 28 June. In particular,  the Australian and

New Zealand Ministers endorsed the Summit call on Vietnam

and the other countries of Indochina to take urgent and

effective measures so that the present human hardship and

suffering are eliminated. The Council members welcomed the "

action of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in

convening an international conference on the refugee problem

and agreed to participate in this conference The members pledged

their Governments to play full and active parts in international

efforts to deal with the Indochina refugee problem.

Welcoming the accession to independence of the Colomon

Islands and Tuvalu since the last Council meeting, the Council

reaffirmed the importance it attached to the continued peaceful

progress of the South Pacific. The Council declared the

readiness of the ANZUS partners to co-operate with the South

Pacific States in support of a common interest in a secure and

peaceful regional environment in which the countries of the

region could most effectively pursue their national policies.

It welcomed the further development of regional co-operation

in the South Pacific community.

The Ministers took note of progress towards completion

of self determination processes in the Trust Territory of the

Pacific Islands and plans for termination of the Trusteeship

during 1981.

Council members noted that the United States and the

Soviet Union,  at the recent Vienna Summit,  had agreed to discuss

the resumption of their bilateral talks on questions concerning

arms limitation measures in the Indian Ocean. They agreed

that a military escalation between the United States and the

Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean should be avoided and expressed j

their support for mutual arms limitation measures consistent

with the security interests of the ANZUS partners.

During a wide ranging review of other political,

ÃÂ¯  Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· ’  and security i ssvrÂ»s of concern to the tr-zns pa-* r’, - .  Â·Ã¢ÂÂ *, .

the Australian and New Zealand Ministers welcomed the recent

signing of the SALT II agreement between the United States Â·  ‘

and the Soviet Union. They expressed their strong continuing

support for the SALT process and their hope that the next

phase of SALT negotiations would commence with the minimum

possible delay. The ANZUS partners agreed that continuing

progress in the SALT process was essential for the maintenance

of international stability and in minimising the possibility .

of nuclear war.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  The Council members reviewed international efforts

to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and expressed

satisfaction that the Non-Proliferation Treaty continued to

attract new adherents. They renewed their previous calls on

all states to ratify the Treaty. They agreed that the widest

possible acceptance of non-proliferation -  restraints presented

the only viable basis for the stable development of international

trade and co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear

energy. They expressed deep concern that great harm would be

done to such trade and cooperation and to international stability

if any additional state were to embark upon the development

of a nuclear explosive capability.

The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the cessation

of nuclear testing by all states in all environments.

It was agreed that a comprehensive test ban treaty would be

a further important barrier both to the spread of nuclear

weapons to additional countries and to the expansion of existing

nuclear arsenals. Such a treaty would also contribute to a greater

level ___ /7

of mutual confidence among states in all regions of the world '

ahd provide iurther reassurance to the international community

that nuclear programs in non-nuclear weapon states were directed

to peaceful uses. Australia and New Zealand underlined the

importance they attached to the earliest possible conclusion

of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and the significant

contribution such a treaty could make to a successful outcome

to the second NPT Review Conference in June 1980.

.  The Ministers reviewed developments in the north

west littoral of the Indian Ocean and in the Middle East.  ,They

welcomed the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty as a first step

towards the achievement of a comprehensive Middle East

settlement,  recognising at the same.time that difficult Ã¢ÂÂ

problems,  including that of making provision for the legitimate

rights of the Palestinians, remained to be resolved and the

importance of making rapid and substantial progress in the

negotiations relating to the West Bank and Gaza currently,

under way. .

Council members expressed their concern over continuing

conflicts in Africa,  particularly in southern Horn, and at the continuing foreign military intervention in  African disputes.  They noted that while recent developments  in Zimbabwe represented an advance on the previous situation, 8 they had not brought an end to conflict and suffering in that  country. The Ministers expressed the hope that it would  be possible to develop a new political process leading to  an early and internationally acceptable end to the conflict . They also expressed concern at the lack of progress towards  the achievement of a settlement in Namibia, and their wish  that the Western five countries* plan for such a settlement  through elections organised and supervised by the United Nations  could be implemented as soon as possible. In considering the global economic situation the  Ministers reviewed the results of the recent Tokyo economic  summit meeting, in which Secretary Vance had participated,  world energy problems, and the outlook for the North/South  dialogue in the aftermath of the UNCTAD V conference. Ministers viewed with concern the present world economic  situation which was characterised by a resurgence in  inflation and recently by sharp increases in the price of  oil accompanied by supply shortages. The developments in  this oil situation will have a disruptive effect on the economies  of the developed countries and a particularly serious impact on the  developing countries in the region. The Council accordingly noted  that there is a greatly increased urgency for countries to adopt  strong measures to reduce oil imports, including the adoption of  the world market level for domestic oil prices, and to undertake  substantially greater efforts to use and develop alternative  energy sources. Council members were pleased to note the focus  on these issues in the communique adopted at the recent Tokyo  Summit meeting. - 9 - Â· In welcoming the Tokyo Summit's call for  constructive North/South discussions the Council took the  opportunity to affirm their commitment to develop constructive,   practical and viable proposals in negotiations with developing  countries on international economic issues. Cooperation to  enhance energy and food production prospects in developing  countries,  and to enhance their technological capabilities  in these areas and others, such as health and the environment,   will be particularly important. The Ministers also affirmed  the urgent need for developed countries ahd developing countries  to cooperate to promote sustained non-inflationary.  growth,  to adopt policies consistent with sound economic management,   to develop positive adjustment policies and not-to be deflected  from the objective of the further liberalisation of international  trade. They further recognised the need for sustained  cooperation to identify long-term issues which must be  addressed in common in the coming decade and to ensure a mutually  beneficial evolution of the world economy.
