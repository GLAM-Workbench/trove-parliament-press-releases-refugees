Nation Building, Investing in our Future:  Federal Labor’s Response to the State of the Regions 2003 Report

MARTIN FERGUSON MP

Shadow Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Transport and Infrastructure

Thank you for the opportunity to address you today and to  comment on the 2003 State of the Regions Report.

In my experience with this report, a different lens has been used  each year to develop a sophisticated and clear picture of what is  happening with our regions.

In previous years the reports have focussed on housing  affordability, environmental indicators, creativity, employment and  how our regions compare internationally.

This year’s report focuses on population and ageing.

Throughout the years and different themes, a consistent message  emerges - Australia needs a more sophisticated and integrated  approach to regional policy.



This years report confirms Labor’s position that the challenge is  not just a question of increasing the population, but ensuring the  right mix of people and the associated infrastructure.

This report continues to quantify the growing disparity between  well to do regions and disadvantaged regions.  It is clear that Australia needs a different approach to urban and  regional development.

It is not acceptable that some people are denied opportunity  because of where they live.

Australia is currently at the crossroads.  While our nation is not at  crisis point, the Howard Government continues on a steady  course of complacency that pays scant regard to the legacy to be  left for our children and grandchildren.

There is a widespread sense that government is failing to plan for  and invest in the future.

What is clear is that the Howard Government is under-investing in  infrastructure, education, training and research and health, and  by doing so, failing to tap into the next stage of productivity  growth and economic prosperity.

What we need to be clear about is why this is the case. I put it to

you today that it is a direct result of the ideological approach  taken by the Howard Government to the way they govern our  nation.

There are clear and unequivocal differences between Labor and  the Liberal party.



The Liberal party and their coalition partner have set a course of  division.

It is a political strategy based on defence and security issues.

It is a strategy about looking inward, negative and defensive  rather than forward and positive.

Their’s is a course set to capitalise on fear and insecurity in our  community, banking on the negative agenda to get them over the  line.

This Government is prepared to lie, deceive, exaggerate and  inflame division for political gain.

Labor has a different view.

The need for a strong defence and national security policy is a  given in our policy.



Labor has never shirked from our need to have strong defence  and national security policy and spending.

We have never shirked from our responsibility to have a fair  immigration system.

Contrary to the line being driven by the Howard spin doctors, we  have never had an open border policy for asylum seekers, but we  had a fair system for hearing their case that did not demonise  them.

While the issues of defence and security are a given in our policy,  Labor has other messages for the election as well.

Australians expect more than that from prospective leaders.    They expect to hear what Government is prepared to do to  improve their quality of life and generate opportunities for their  children.



When family get sick, Australians expect to be able to visit a  doctor.

When a child is considering a career, Australians expect them to  have options they can afford - university, TAFE or a job.

When an aged parent can no longer provide for their own needs,  Australians expect affordable and available aged care services.

Australians also expect to have drinking water and a healthy  environment.

When they read in the paper that within 20 years, Australians in  Adelaide won’t have drinkable water 2 days out of 5, they know  that not enough is being done.

Labor will go to the next election with a positive agenda that  focuses on how to rebuild and improve our infrastructure.

Our focus will be on demonstrating that Australia needs a Labor  national government that will rebuild and grow our social and  physical infrastructure.

Labor’s policies will focus on health, education, the environment  and nation building.

We must repair the damage and neglect and lay the foundation  for the ongoing modernisation of our infrastructure.

This generation must act now to ensure we do not have a  reputation as users, who have not pulled our weight for future  generations.

Australia faces huge challenges on the infrastructure front:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We have an ageing population, growing health care and  pharmaceuticals costs.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Burgeoning freight demands, congested cities, salinity and  greenhouse problems.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Housing  affordability  and availability problems abound.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We have critical skill shortages in key trades and  professions.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Many of our regional centres are losing jobs, services and

the basic things that sustain their populations.

The Howard Government continues to put pressure on Australian  families as it is the highest taxing government in history, but has  also failed to invest in infrastructure and services.

Labor has demonstrated we can deliver better services through  repositioning Howard Government spending.

There is a view that national investment is bad and high  surpluses are a must.  This is not how we run our businesses or  households nor how we should run Australia.

As my father said when he was a councillor, “a council with no  debt is a council that does nothing.”

We are seeing the signs of this in Australia.

We have ailing infrastructure and a national government that is  not prepared to invest in fixing it.

The debate about how we pay for infrastructure is current and  critical.



Labor will be a national Government that will work with State and  Local Governments and other community leaders to focus on  plans to address these challenges.

It is time that we fronted up to the debate.  It is time we looked

beyond the next electoral cycle and set a long term path for  Australia.

John Howard and Peter Costello are stuck on the old model of  development - based on privatisation, deregulation and free  market ideology.

Labor’s Positive Agenda

Labor believes in a new agenda based on the concepts of  investment, innovation and learning.

This is the only way to a high-wage, high-skill economy, with  more rewarding and more secure jobs.

One unavoidable requirement is a substantial increase in national  investment in the drivers of growth, infrastructure, innovation,  education, training and research.

We also require a coherent agenda to create jobs and enhance  skills in the workforce.

Already with our Aim Higher policy, Labor has made a clear  commitment to the necessary investment in education and  training.

Core national infrastructure is critical to economic development,  particularly in a nation such as Australia where geography still  poses a major barrier to people and businesses accessing  markets and services.

Australia is a highly urbanised, but geographically vast nation,  with a relatively small population.  This creates unique challenges  in relation to meeting the infrastructure needs of all cities and  regions, and protecting our natural environment.

Aside from being critical to business development, but transport,  communications, water and energy services are essential for  people and communities.

As the State of the Regions Report says, it is not just getting  more numbers to places, but having the right demographic profile  and liveability.

Good physical and social infrastructure and services are the key  to liveability - regardless of the location in Australia.

Good infrastructure is fundamental to our future.

It is critical to traditional industries such as agriculture, mining  and manufacturing, as well as newer ones such as biotechnology,  renewable energy and tourism.

At present our infrastructure backlog is enormous and growing.

Independent analyses by organisations like Engineers Australia  and AusCID have estimated the backlog to be more than $20  billion.

That is a lot of money and a big bill to pass on to future

generations if we don’t act responsibly.

Roads, railways, ports, water, energy, communications are all  areas that need upgrading.

It is important to note that this backlog relates to maintenance as  well as construction.

Not only are we not building enough new infrastructure to cope  with our community’s needs, we as a nation are also failing to  look after the infrastructure that previous generations built for us.

The task cannot be achieved quickly or easily.

But the task must be tackled.  Ignoring the task will not make it  go away.

A commitment to national investment in infrastructure is clearly  required.



That investment must be in terms of how we plan, how we fund  and how we efficiently build and maintain infrastructure.

Our proposed National Infrastructure Advisory Council will  promote a smarter approach to national infrastructure planning,  prioritisation and delivery.

The Council will involve the private sector and all tiers of  government.

The key task for the Council will be to examine options to  encourage more investment in infrastructure development and  help set objective, transparent criteria for delivering the right  projects.

Already each State Government has a strategy for involving the  private sector in their infrastructure development. It is only the  Commonwealth Government that refuses to front up to the issue.

Councillors, the Federal Government must be more actively  involved in shaping the pattern of sustainable national  development and settlement, rather than leaving it to the whim of  the market.

I think it is clearly articulated in the State of the Regions report  and will also be a focus for attention over the next few days of  this conference.

Labor accepts and is taking on this challenge.

A Federal Labor Government will build a population and  settlement policy to guide our decisions and policy making.

On Friday, in Adelaide, the Howard Government refused to back a  national population policy.

Labor has released a discussion paper that explores the issues  on immigration and the regions and the characteristics of our  settlement patterns.

The State of the Regions Report released today also makes a  valuable contribution to the debate.

It is unequivocal.



Our changing demographics are affecting our regions.

Some regions are booming but some are not.

Without active government intervention, this trend will not only  continue it will get worse.

Conclusion

Today I have outlined Labor’s values on nation building and what  is needed to address this impending crisis in our communities.

It is a bold and ambitious plan to invest in our future because it is  a different approach to a complex problem.

But this is what is needed because the current national approach,  or lack of it, is not working.



Our nation building agenda can only be achieved in full  partnership with all States and Territories and local governments.

Different tiers of Government must not continue to work against  each other.

All the people in this room today will have a role in rebuilding our  nation - region by region.

We all have a role to play and every region has a contribution and  a responsibility to improve our national wealth and lifestyle and  what we leave for future generations.

I look forward to working with you all both now and as part of the  future Labor Federal Government.

Thankyou
