E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

MARTIN KING:

IÃ¢ÂÂd like to welcome to the programme federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. Tony, good afternoon.

TONY ABBOTT:

GÃ¢ÂÂday Martin.

MARTIN KING:

Tony the Newspoll today shows that clearly the Coalition is winning the battle over whether this country  needs a carbon dioxide tax. You must be pretty pleased with that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to talk about the polls and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think people need the polls to know that this  carbon tax is a very bad thing. I mean, I think on first principles they would know that it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt make any  sense to be the first in the world to embrace this tax because if you are the first in the world, not only do you  impose an unnecessary additional cost on consumers but you impose a huge hit on the competitiveness of  your own industries and IÃ¢ÂÂve been making it my business to talk to the steel industry, the cement industry,  yesterday I was at a bus making plant in Sydney and these are all industries that are going to find their costs  escalating under the carbon tax and thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to mean that itÃ¢ÂÂs very, very difficult for them to compete  and I want us to be a country that makes things.

MARTIN KING:

Well, Julia Gillard turned this poll around Tony and said it proved that most Australians believe in climate  change. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs your reaction to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Martin, look, I keep saying that climate change is real, mankind makes a contribution and itÃ¢ÂÂs important to  have a strong and effective policy to deal with it and what I am proposing is that the Government should

spend about $1 billion a year from savings in the budget to do things like plant more trees on suitable land,  not prime agricultural land, to increase the carbon content of soil and to use smart technology such as that  which we are starting to see at some power stations where they take the carbon dioxide from the  smokestacks and rather than treating that as a waste product they use it as an input into things like algae  growing and under the right conditions you can grow massive quantities of algae using carbon dioxide,  sunlight and seawater, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs very good for bio-diesel and for stock feed. So, yes, climate change  happens, no doubt about that. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got to deal with it intelligently, not stupidly and making petrol and  power more expensive, driving the steel industry and the aluminium industry and the motor industry and the  cement industry offshore to China and Indonesia and elsewhere - thatÃ¢ÂÂs a really stupid way of dealing with  climate change.

MARTIN KING:

I just reckon the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs really shot itself in the foot over drip feeding this information on how the tax  is going to work. I just think theyÃ¢ÂÂve made a mess of it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a fair point, Martin. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs sort of politics 101 not to announce something you canÃ¢ÂÂt  explain and the Prime Minister canÃ¢ÂÂt explain it. The Treasurer doesnÃ¢ÂÂt understand it. The Labor Premier of  Queensland canÃ¢ÂÂt bring herself to support it. So why would Australians vote for it? I mean, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the  challenge I think and, you know, we had Wayne Swan the other day scoffing at the impact of a carbon tax  on the steel making and then you had the head of BlueScope come out and say, Ã¢ÂÂwell, hang on a minute, you  donÃ¢ÂÂt understand steel making and you donÃ¢ÂÂt understand your own taxÃ¢ÂÂ because at the kind of figures that  have been bandied around in the past by the Government, this is up to a billion dollars over eight years hit  on BlueScope. Now, BlueScope is a good company, itÃ¢ÂÂs a strong company but we all know that it is tough to  make steel in Australia competitively with countries with lower wages costs and if we want to keep a steel  industry and pay our workers well, which we should, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to say no to a carbon tax.

MARTIN KING:

Well, Julia Gillard is meeting with business leaders at Kirribilli House tonight to talk to them about the  carbon tax, or carbon dioxide tax. What do you make of this?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that what these business leaders want is not a good feed, they want a good explanation, and, in  particular, they want guarantees not lobster mornay, they want guarantees…

MARTIN KING:

Will they swallow it Tony? ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the thing.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think any self respecting business leader will accept let alone support a carbon tax if there is no  cast iron guarantee that there will be no impact on competitiveness, if thereÃ¢ÂÂs no cast iron guarantee that  thereÃ¢ÂÂll be no impact on jobs. Now, if the Government canÃ¢ÂÂt guarantee that thereÃ¢ÂÂll be not be a single job  lost, if the Government canÃ¢ÂÂt guarantee that there will be no harm to Australian industriesÃ¢ÂÂ competitiveness,  well then itÃ¢ÂÂs an utterly toxic tax and it shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be proceeded with.

MARTIN KING:

Tony, can I just turn to the budget now? The Finance Minister Penny Wong has challenged you today to  show how you could bring the budget back to a surplus a year earlier than the Government. How would you  do it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, in the election campaign Martin, we put forward $50 billion worth of savings over the forward  estimates and as a result of our savings and as a result of not proceeding with some massive white elephant  projects, like the National Broadband Network, we thought that we could be about $3 billion better off in  2012-13. We thought we could achieve $10 to $11 billion worth of savings over the forward estimate period  vis-a-vis the Government, and we thought that we would be $30 billion lower in debt over the period than  the Government. So we demonstrated all of that at election time and in good time before the next election  weÃ¢ÂÂll do it again. But IÃ¢ÂÂm certainly not going to respond to cheeky challenges from a minister who IÃ¢ÂÂm  afraid is going to be guilty of bringing down a budget, or helping to bring down a budget, without the carbon  tax in it. Now, if they bring down a budget on Tuesday night that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt include the carbon tax, well the  budget wonÃ¢ÂÂt be worth the paper that it is printed on.

MARTIN KING:

On detention centres quickly, I know you are pressed for time. Can the Government turn this around? Can  Julia Gillard turn this around? ItÃ¢ÂÂs very damaging.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think, Martin, that the only way to fix this is to stop the boats and one of the things that the Government  does need to be prepared to do is turn around a boat because that would send the strongest possible signal to  people smugglers and their potential clients. Now, she should also pick up the phone to the President of  Nauru because Nauru has an Australian taxpayer funded centre on the island and theyÃ¢ÂÂd be very happy to  reopen it and can do it within a matter of weeks. The other thing she should do is immediately, immediately  declare that no one who comes illegally by boat will get permanent residency, if they are found to get  refugees theyÃ¢ÂÂll get temporary protection visas. Instead, what sheÃ¢ÂÂs saying is that rioters will get temporary  protection visas. Well, look, thatÃ¢ÂÂs like rolling out the welcome carpet. I mean, this is just completely  counterproductive. Unfortunately the Australian Government is being taken for mugs by these people and  itÃ¢ÂÂs just wrong.

MARTIN KING:

Was it a lie, Tony, for the Prime Minister to suggest during the election campaign that Labor was working  with the East Timorese to set up that processing centre there when it seems clear they had no idea what she  was talking about?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, I think youÃ¢ÂÂre right. I mean, she announced something without even talking to the people who could  possibly bring it about and it was just an act of political lunacy to make that claim and I think it has rightly  haunted her ever since. I think they needed to have something that could pose as an answer to the boat  people problem…

MARTIN KING:

Or an alternative.

TONY ABBOTT:

…and they plucked this out of the air. It was an utterly cynical exercise which has turned out to be a  complete sham. But, you know, the Government told a lot of lies during the election campaign and I guess  the most notorious one was the “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.”

MARTIN KING:

Correct. Now, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if you know this, Tony Abbott, but at Villawood itÃ¢ÂÂs been revealed there was a  homemade bomb found a month before last monthÃ¢ÂÂs riots. This is out of control now surely.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs very worrying and the fact that this kind of thing is happening, the fact that the Minister wasnÃ¢ÂÂt  upfront about it is a bit of a worry…

MARTIN KING:

Well, he didnÃ¢ÂÂt know, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

..and it just shows that the whole place is completely out of control. This is a Government which has not  only lost control of our borders but which is rapidly losing control of our detention centres too.

MARTIN KING:

Are you aware that when asked by my colleague Ray Hadley this morning, Immigration Minister Chris  Bowen was totally in the dark about that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen the transcript and before I got too prescriptive IÃ¢ÂÂd want to see the transcript. But I think  the interesting comparison is that it took the New South Wales police three hours to bring down off the roof  people protesting on the Immigration MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs office, but it took the federal Government 11 days and still  they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt get people off the roof of Villawood. Now, what was happening to clandestinely supply those  people with food and water and recharged mobile phone batteries and so on, who knows. What deals were  done to get them down off the roof, who knows. But plainly this is a Government which finds it impossible  to be tough in the face of unconscionable provocation.

MARTIN KING:

Tony, one final very quick question if you can give me just a couple of words as an answer. If you were a  businessman tonight going to Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs dinner what would you say to the Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂd say drop this toxic tax.

MARTIN KING:

Good answer.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much.
