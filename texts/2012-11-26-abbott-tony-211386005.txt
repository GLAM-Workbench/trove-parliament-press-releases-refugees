TONY ABBOTT:

Today, the Coalition will be introducing a private members bill to try to ensure that there is a level playing  field for officials of unions and for directors and officials of companies. It's very important that people who  commit essentially the same offence should pay essentially the same price and if you are in favour of doing  the right thing by union members, you'll vote in favour of this legislation. If you're in favour of allowing  dodgy union officials to get off more or less scot-free, you'll vote against this legislation. So, this is a real  test for the Government and for the Prime Minister. My fear is that too many members of this government  are too conflicted and too compromised by their past union associations. If we want to see a clean and  straight and honest union movement, I fear the only way to get it is to change the government.

Also, this week marks the fifth anniversary of the election of the Rudd-Gillard Government. It has been five  years of backflips and broken promises; five years of disappointments and dashed hopes. This government,  has hurt you, it’s wasted your money, it’s betrayed your trust, it has compromised your future. Again, the  only way to restore hope, reward and opportunity is to change this government and that's my mission, to  change this government as quickly as I can to give Australians back the kind of trust in their polity, the kind  of confidence in their officials that I think they want and deserve.

QUESTION:

Are you exploiting the Prime Minister's situation doing this?

TONY ABBOTT:

We have been pressing the point here for the best part of a year and I think it's very important that the  Government say exactly where it stands on this. Is it in favour of ensuring that union officials who rip off  their members are appropriately punished? Or does it want to continue to make excuses for dodgy behaviour  inside the union movement?

QUESTION:

Why didn't you introduce this, though, at the height of the Craig Thomson scandal?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a perfectly appropriate time to introduce this legislation.

QUESTION:

The Greens say the existing laws are tough enough and there's no need to toughen them even further when it  comes to this issue.

TONY ABBOTT:

What's right and proper for company officials who do the wrong thing, surely, should be right and proper for  union officials who do the wrong thing and there's a vast disparity at the moment between the penalties on  company officials and company directors and the relative taps on the wrist which union officials get.

QUESTION:

Will you be censuring the Prime Minister today over the AWU scandal?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s important that the Prime Minister be as open and candid about her conduct as a lawyer in the 1990s as  Julie Bishop has been when questions were put to her on various legal matters she handled in her past. Now,  the point I keep making is that I'm more than ready to give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt but in  order to give her the benefit of the doubt, we've got to hear her side of the story and all we've had from the  Prime Minister so far are increasingly shrill stonewallings, increasingly shrill denials. Now, there is enough  new material, enough documentary evidence, enough discrepancy between what appears to be the case  based on the documents and what the Prime Minister has said was the case, for a full explanation to be  warranted.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, why is the LNP falling apart in Queensland?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don't believe that it is.

QUESTION:

Is it going to be damaging for you to see the splits we are seeing up in Queensland?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I just don't accept the premise of the question.

QUESTION:

Well, ok, they've lost someone. Someone's effectively gone to the Katter party. How damaging is it going to  be for you if we continue to see that?

TONY ABBOTT:

If we get the kind of election result that Campbell Newman got in Queensland, I'd be a very happy man.

QUESTION:

That's the past, Tony. What about now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Very happy to give Campbell Newman all credit for exposing a bad Labor government, for winning a  magnificent victory and for tackling the entrenched problems that we find when you have had too many  years of bad Labor government.

QUESTION:

Do you think the fall-out with Clive Palmer is hurting the party, though?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a matter for the party in Queensland.

QUESTION:

There was a report in The Canberra Times on the weekend that the public service have been told to clear the  decks ahead of a possible March election. Do you think we could be heading to the polls in early 2013?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, this is a matter for the Prime Minister but I want to give Australia better government and I believe  the only way to get better government is to change the current government. I think that's the only way to get  a better government. Now, we are ready to fight an election whenever it's called - and I think the Australian  people would be happy to have an election sooner rather than later - because I think the conclusion they've  come to quite a long time ago is that minority government is an experiment that's failed.

QUESTION:

Do you think the arguments the Opposition's been putting forward on asylum seekers and now the slush  fund, we haven't really seen much change in the polls. They seem to have stagnated even though the  Coalition is just now marginally in front of Labor.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, every day my job is the same - regardless of polls, regardless of the static surrounding the  Government or any particular day - my job is to point out the failings in the current government, to present a  credible alternative. The point I keep making to people is we can have stronger borders, we can have  stronger budgetary situation, we can have better services but we need a better government to bring that  about.

QUESTION:

Will you be working extra hard over the Christmas break, though, to improve your polling numbers and sell  your message better to the electorate?

TONY ABBOTT:

I'll be having the same sort of Christmas break that I normally have; that’s to say I’ll take a week down the  coast with my family and some other families we've always been holidaying with. It will be an opportunity  to get out on the surfboard a bit. That's the way I've always spent a week in January and that's the way I'll be  spending it this year, too.

QUESTION:

Tony, on the slush fund, the Government is saying that the Opposition needs to put specific allegations to  the Prime Minister. Do you have specific questions or allegations that you'd like Julia Gillard to answer?

TONY ABBOTT:

Let's never forget that all of this was first put to the public's attention by Robert McClelland. It wasn't put to  the public by us. So, Robert McClelland started this. We've got one of Julia Gillard's former law partners,  Nick Styant-Browne who obviously doesn't believe the Prime Minister's story and is presumably in a  position to make judgments about her conduct as a lawyer in those days and just recently we've had no less a  person than Bill Shorten, the Minister for Workplace Relations, say that the establishment of the slush fund  by the Prime Minister was “inappropriate”, “unauthorised” and “out of bounds.” So, when this is…

QUESTION:

What are the questions you want to put to Julia Gillard?

TONY ABBOTT:

…well, as I said, when Bill Shorten thinks that the Prime Minister's conduct was “unauthorised”,  “inappropriate” and “out of bounds” I think there are obviously matters that need to be cleared up.

Thank you.
