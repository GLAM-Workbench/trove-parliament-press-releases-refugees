Interview with Stuart Bocking, 2UE  08:20 AM  Monday, 19 December 2011



STUART BOCKING:            ...But to some bleaker news to our North and this  situation which has unfolded off the coastline of Java.  The more details that  come through, the worst it seems.

It’s feared up to 185 of the 250 people on board this overcrowded vessel may  have drowned, up to 40 of those believed to have been children.  Survivors  saying the captain and six crew abandoned them immediately the boat began  to sink.

And now of course we hear about this case where the asylum seekers are  thought to be from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey apparently paid up  to five-thousand dollars each to make the trip to Australia.  And you think  about that, for the people smugglers, that is more than a million dollars from  this tragedy alone.

He’s only been in the job a handful of days.  Jason Clare is the new Minister  for Homeland Security and Affairs.  He is also the Minister for Justice.  He is  the local MP for the seat of Blaxland in Sydney’s south west.  He is a good  man.  He’s on the line.  Jason, good morning.

JASON CLARE:       Good morning Stuart.  Good to talk to you.

STUART BOCKING:            Thank you very much and congratulations on  your new appointment although a baptism of fire of sorts.  Just bring us up to  date officially with what you know is the circumstance surrounding this boat  and the death toll with it.

JASON CLARE:       Sure.  As you know, we understand the boat capsized at  seven AM on Saturday morning, Indonesia time.  The search has been  continuing for survivors ever since then.  In the press this morning there’s  some confusion over how many people have been rescued.

Indonesian authorities are still telling me eighty-six, but in the press you will  see numbers much lower than that.  All I can say there is I’m hopeful that the  number is higher rather than lower and that they rescue more people.

They will continue the search and rescue effort this morning.  It’s dark over  Java now, but as sun comes up, the Indonesian Navy and police will continue  their search.  And this morning they will be aided by Australian assistance.

You will know Stuart that yesterday I offered a P-3 aircraft as well as an  Armidale Class Patrol Boat.  And in the early hours of this morning the  Indonesians accepted that offer.  So a boat and a plane are on their way.  In  addition to a customs plane, a Dash 8, which will also help with surveillance  and assistance.

STUART BOCKING:            I know obviously our relationship with Indonesia  has improved dramatically in recent years.  They do a lot of work in relation to  anti-terrorism efforts which again is at the forefront of your efforts now in the  new portfolio. But we learnt today that a number of these people had flown  from Dubai to Jakarta where Indonesian officials are said to be ready for the  migrants to arrive, charging them each five-hundred US dollars to pass  through the airport without visas.  It does make it difficult if in the one hand  Indonesia gives us one message, in another they’re taking money to allow  these people to pass through airports without visas.

JASON CLARE:       It’s very concerning.  I do have to say, in the short time  I’ve been in this job I’ve seen plenty of evidence of Indonesian National Police  and Australian Federal Police working very closely and very effectively  together.  I don’t think we can pretend that the work our police do together is  going to stop every boat…

STUART BOCKING:            Yes.

JASON CLARE:       But they do very effective work.  One example that  comes to mind is the people smuggler responsible for that boat that crashed  on Christmas Island a year ago was arrested because of the work that the two  police forces did together.  A bloke called Haydar Khani - and there is plenty  of examples of that.

But one way to try and make a difference, stop people getting on boats and  drowning in the middle of the sea, is to have the Indonesian police, the  Australian police and for that matter Malaysian police and others working  closely together to identify these people before they get on a boat.



STUART BOCKING:            Given there is so much focus on Indonesia with  these sorts of things and we’ve seen umpteen boats tragically perish off the  coastline in and around Java particularly.  We know that obviously the  Opposition it’s tied to is Nauru.  The preferred option for the Government is

Malaysia. If you both agree in relation to offshore processing, is there not  some argument to say have a closer look at Indonesia and see whether  working with the Indonesians we could set up some type of facility there that

would enable us to process those people before they even take the risk of  getting on board one of these boats which increasingly are getting bigger and  are also hopelessly overloaded Jason?

JASON CLARE:       Yes.  Yes, that’s right.  And the more people that are on  them, the greater risk that the boat is going to capsize and you’re going to see  a repeat of what’s happened over the course of the last forty-eight hours.   We’ve got a big problem here.  We’ve got the monsoon season that has  returned.  The weather out there is atrocious Stuart. I’m told five to six metre  waves, which makes me very worried about the prospects of finding anyone  else alive.

And you’ve got people smugglers that have become more brazen and back in  business trying to find people to put onto boats.  You’re right that the  Government supports offshore processing.  The Opposition supports offshore  processing as well.

The people listening to this program would expect us to get together and work  together on this to implement it.  There are people of goodwill on the Labor  side, on the Liberal side.  We’ve got to work maturely and sensibly through  this and implement offshore processing.

STUART BOCKING:            Do you think this will heighten it?  I mean I know  everyone was saying yesterday we’ve got to keep the politics out of it.  It’s  almost impossible to keep the politics out of it.  It is a tragedy no doubt about  that.  But I mean given you don’t like the idea of Nauru; the Opposition doesn’t  like the idea of Malaysia.  Perhaps there is now the option for a third  alternative that does tick the box in terms of offshore processing, does seem  to tick the box in terms of what is the main transit point for these vessels.   That being some sort of facility in Indonesia to ensure that these types of  tragedy don’t have to happen.  And by doing that we might put the people  smugglers out of business bang just like that.

JASON CLARE:       Well think back thirty-five, thirty-six years ago Stuart to  the fall of Saigon and those Vietnamese refugees who got on boats.

STUART BOCKING:            Yes.

JASON CLARE:       When that happened, something like half a million people  died, drowned at sea.  And the solution there - and Malcolm Fraser was  involved in it - was regional refugee centres in places like Malaysia, in the  Philippines and in Thailand.

The UN, they got involved.  They ended up winning a Nobel Peace Prize in  1981 for the work they did.  It helped to stop people from making that  dangerous journey all the way to Australia.  And it meant that Australians took

more refugees, more than they would have if they went by boat.

I think if you ask most Australians, they will say they want to stop people  getting on a boat and drowning at sea.  But they also want to help refugees.

And the story of Vietnam tells us that the way to do that is through offshore  processing, wherever that might be, and through all the countries of the  regions - of the region working together.

STUART BOCKING:            So could Indonesia therefore be an option?

JASON CLARE:       Well this is more Chris Bowen’s patch in terms of the  work he’s doing with Indonesia and Malaysia and so forth.  So I won’t  anticipate any of the work that he’s doing other than to say that the  Government supports offshore processing.

We think that the work we’re doing with Malaysia holds the best hope of  stopping people getting on a boat because why would you pay someone four,  five, ten-thousand dollars if you are going to be sent to Malaysia rather than  Australia?

STUART BOCKING:            The other point being as well it seems  increasingly we’ve done a very good job of confiscating these vessels,  burning them in Darwin and elsewhere.  And now obviously they’ve read the  tea leaves and realised well no point sending our best vessels and so the  boats are getting increasingly unseaworthy because they know it’s basically a  one way trip.  The boats won’t be coming back.

JASON CLARE:       That’s true.  It’s true.  But I don’t think that you reduce the  risk of people getting on a boat and drowning at sea by sending the boats  back to the people smugglers.  So it’s as simple as that.

STUART BOCKING:            Yes, no.  There’s no question about that.  But it  highlights I suppose yet again just how vexed, how difficult this issue is  because there are a range of different factors all working in different ways at  the same time aren’t there?

JASON CLARE:       That’s right and the consequence of that is that people  are getting on boats.  Boats are capsizing or sinking and people are dying.   There’s a real prospect over the next few days that we’ll find out that more  than a hundred people have died at sea.  Just think about that.

STUART BOCKING:            Look…

JASON CLARE:       People have died and there are other people potentially  still alive out there right now.  That’s obviously why I am focussed on working  with Customs and Border [Protection] Command today to see what we can do  to help.

STUART BOCKING:            Well good on you.  Look I appreciate your time.  I  know you are only very new to the job and thrown straight in literally at the  deep end.  But I appreciate your time and being available this morning.   Minister, thank you.

JASON CLARE:       Not at all Stuart.  Thanks mate.



STUART BOCKING:            All the best to you.  Bye bye.  Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare.  He’s a good man and MP for Blaxland, Paul Keating’s  old seat in Sydney’s south west in and around Bankstown.  So that is a  baptism of fire there as the new Minister for Homeland Affairs.  It’s a big job.  And obviously the news coming through not good.  Australia now doing what  they can to assist Indonesia with what rescue efforts remain in that part of the  world.
