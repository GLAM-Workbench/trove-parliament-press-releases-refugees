Selection of new UN Secretary-General



I welcome the appointment of Mr AntÃÂ³nio Guterres as the next UN Secretary-General from January  2017.

Mr Guterres brings a wealth of experience to the role. He served with distinction as UN High  Commissioner for Refugees from 2005-2015 and as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995-2002. He is a  seasoned and accomplished diplomat with decades of leadership experience in his native Portugal and  on the international stage.

Australia is a longstanding supporter of the UN. The Government looks forward to working  constructively with Mr Guterres on global challenges such as refugees, terrorism, conflict prevention  and sustainable development.

Australia is committed to supporting ongoing reform of the UN to make it a stronger, more agile  organisation that can tackle priority issues effectively and efficiently.
