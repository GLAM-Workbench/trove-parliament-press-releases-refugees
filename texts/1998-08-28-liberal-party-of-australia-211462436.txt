MINISTER ANNOUNCES COMMUNITY GRANTS TO ASSIST 
MIGRANT SETTLEMENT

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today anno unced a $19.3 million package of funding to assist 
migrants and refugees to settle quickly and effectively into the Australian 
community.

Â

“The funding package includes $14.8 million for 
the Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme to extend worker grants 
awarded in the 1997-98 round for a further 12 months and $2.4 million 
for new project grants, as well as $2.1 million for the National Forum 
of Services for Survivors of Torture and Trauma,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“Priority groups for funding this year include refugees 
and humanitarian entrants, women, youth and the elderly, new and emerging 
communities, and refugees and migrants settling in rural and remote 
areas.

Â

“This funding reflects the Government’s recognition 
of the importance of ensuring that humanitarian entrants and migrants 
are able to settle quickly in their new country and contribute effectively 
to the Australian community.

Â

“We need to ensure that new settlers, particularly 
people that may have been tortured or traumatised, can access services 
that are currently available to other members of the community”.

Â

Nearly 400 applications were received for new projects 
following the announcement of funding in March this year, of which 119 
were successful. The selection involved a three-month assessment process 
by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and inter-departmental 
committees in each State and Territory.

Â

Mr Ruddock said all funded organisations are required 
to work to service and funding agreements to ensure high levels of accountability.

Â

“The funding comprises $14.5 million for the provision 
of migrant settlement services and $4.8 million provided under the Integrated 
Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS),” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“This confirms the Government’s commitment to 
providing specialised settlement services for humanitarian entrants 
who are in need of immediate assistance on arrival because of their 
particular circumstances.

Â

“Our responsibility to refugees is not limited to 
offering them protection by resettling in Australia. On arrival they 
are a top priority for delivery of settlement services.

Â

‘This is part of the 1997-98 Budget commitment of 
an additional $20.8 million over 4 years for a new strategy to provide 
a national framework for the delivery of humanitarian settlement services.”

Â

The National Forum of Services for Survivors of Torture 
and Trauma will receive $2.1 million to continue providing an early 
intervention program for refugee and humanitarian entrants.

Â

Mr Ruddock said other agencies such as Anglicare in 
Sydney and the Red Cross in Brisbane will be funded to provide case 
management services for refugee and humanitarian entrants.

Â

“This funding will help ensure that clients are 
provided with assistance in accessing health services, English language 
training, employment, specialist youth and other services as required”.

Â

Letters will be sent to all successful and unsuccessful 
Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme applicants.
