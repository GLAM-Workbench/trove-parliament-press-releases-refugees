TONY ABBOTT:

It is great to be here at the Sydney Markets. I want to thank Bill Chalk and everyone associated with the markets for  making myself and Craig Laundy, the Liberal Party candidate for Reid, so welcome here. The Sydney Markets are an  essential part of the life of our city. These markets are awake while the rest of our city is asleep. They are providing us  with the food, without which this great city of Sydney simply couldn’t function but at every step of the way, these great  markets are going to be hit by the carbon tax. There’s 200,000 cubic metres of cool room in these markets, critically  dependent upon electricity. There are 500 trucks that come into these markets every day. There are thousands of trucks  and vans that leave these markets every day. The carbon tax will hit them when the fridges go on. The carbon tax will hit  them when the trucks turn up. The carbon tax will hit them when the trucks go out. So, the carbon tax is a real threat to  these markets. It’s going to put all their costs up and because they are in a very fiercely competitive sector, many of those  costs aren’t going to be passed on. Some of them will. It’s going to mean higher prices for consumers, squeezed profits for the businesses, less secure employment for the workers. That's why this is such an absolutely toxic tax. My clear lesson  to the Government is this tax is just going to do the families of Australia, the businesses of Australia, the life of Australia,  untold damage and it will just get worse and worse as the tax goes up and up and up.

There is a solution. The solution is to change this government because the first act of an incoming Coalition Government  will be to scrap this toxic tax. Now, Craig Laundy understands this because he has been in business all his life. He  understands that the task of business is to get on with its job and the task of government is to try to make it easier for  people in Australia to create wealth. The trouble with this government is they are more interested in redistribution than  they are in wealth creation. That's one of the many reasons why we need to change them and change them quickly.

So, Craig, you might like to say a few words in support of these markets.

CRAIG LAUNDY:

Thank you, Tony. To follow on from what Tony said, as you make your way around the electorate of Reid be it every  shopfront here today, there’s a small business and those people are putting their homes on the line to open the doors  every morning to provide food to the people of Reid. As you talk to people in the streets of Reid, their concern is cost of  living. The real threat we run from what Tony has said with the carbon tax is that the cost of that tax is passed on directly  to consumers. They are battling to buy fresh fruit and produce as it is and I look forward to being a part of any team with  Tony that repeals this and lowers the cost of living for my fellow constituents in Reid.

Thank you, Tony.

Tony Abbott Federal Member for Warringah | Leader of the Opposition

Bill, do you want to say anything mate?

BILL CHALK:

I’m not just a wholesaler, I’m a producer. The carbon tax will kill farmers in this country. Freight alone, on the 1st of July,  goes up ten per cent. Fertiliser goes up. Cartons go up. We can’t recoup it. We’re a supply and demand situation. This tax  is going to really hurt the people you don’t want to hurt as a public. You can get a little bit of money for sending the kids to  school if you’re in that bracket but if you happen to be a household that has two working, you’re not going to get anything.

All you’re going to do is pay a hell of a lot more for no reason. Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you make of the allegations being levelled against Senators Carr and Joyce from James Ashby?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that sexual harassment is an extremely serious matter. I think that the Government should never have made  light of it. I think that the Government should never have been in the business of accusing Mr Ashby of being some kind of  a political conspirator. It’s a very serious matter and I think the matter should now be dealt with in the courts, without  further commentary from politicians.

QUESTION:

But Barnaby Joyce questioned Mr Ashby’s character as well.

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I’ve made is that people should be allowed to bring these sorts of actions if they feel that that’s what’s happened  to them and they should be able to do it without fear of any character assassination from politicians.

QUESTION:

Do you think seriousness of the allegations has been lost in the political debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, no. I think the public understand just how serious these allegations are. I think the public are shocked that someone  who is supposed to be a custodian of parliamentary standards should be subject to this kind of court proceeding. I think  the public are very, very, very angry about potential misuse of entitlements and I think the public are deeply questioning  the judgement of the Prime Minister in putting Mr Slipper into the top job. Let’s remember why Mr Slipper is the Speaker of  the Parliament. He is the Speaker of the Parliament because Prime Minister Gillard engineered the demise of the former  Speaker Harry Jenkins precisely to put Peter Slipper in there. So, Peter Slipper is entirely a product of this Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

What do you think about asylum seekers double dipping?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what we’ve got to do is stop the boats and if we stop the boats we don’t have this problem. Now, the former

government, which I was part, found a problem and created a solution. The current government lead by the Prime Minister  found a solution and turned it into a problem again. There were next to no boats coming under the former government.  Now a trickle has become a flood because this government has put the people smugglers back in business. The only way  to stop this is to get the people smugglers out of business and that means changing the government as quickly as we can.

QUESTION:

And Greg Combet, he says you’ve over-egged the pudding when it comes to climate change and the public will see that.  What’s your response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the more people see of the carbon tax the less they’ll like it. I think the public understand that compensation is for  today but the tax is forever and it’s just going to go up and up and up as time goes by. This is going to be a reverse tariff  on Australian business. This is going to be a constant drag on families' cost of living and it’s going to be a wrecking ball  just smashing through our economy. The only way to stop it is to change the government and change the government  quickly.

QUESTION:

But on those claims, are you hyping it up too much?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is gratuitous act of economic self-harm. There are sensible ways of protecting our environment. That’s what the  Coalition wants to see in place. What we don’t want is a great big new tax on everything which will do nothing for the  environment but will do an enormous amount of damage to Australian families and Australian businesses. The carbon tax  is socialism masquerading as environmentalism. The public understand that. They understand that it’s a bad tax based on

a lie. They know that it is an act of betrayal by the Prime Minister. That’s why they’re so angry.

Thank you.
