RESUMPTION OF ETHNIC GROUPS' DIRECTORY

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West,   has announced that publication of the Directory of Ethnic  Community Organisations will be resumed in the New Year.

The Directory, which listed over 3 000 organisations from some  110 ethnic groups around Australia, was last printed in 1981. The decision to cease its publication was made on the recommendation  of the Review Of Commonwealth Functions, set up by the previous  government.  .

"My Department has continued to receive requests for updated copies,"  Mr West said. "The Directory was widely used by government  authorities,  voluntary community organisations and private . enterprise." .

The Directory listings covered clubs and organisations with welfare,  educational, cultural,  religious, social and sporting interests. -   The data provided a valuable resource tool especially for social  and welfare workers, researchers,  government and voluntary

agencies and newly-arrived migrants and refugees eager to find  help or a familiar environment.

"The Government will provide free copies of the Directory to  ethnic community organisations and voluntary agencies," Mr West  said. "I see this as an important tool in helping to ensure that  there is effective communication with and between ethnic commÂ­ unities, and that their members enjoy equality of representation

in public institutions."

The announcement was welcomed by the Federation of Ethnic  Communities' Councils of Australia. The Federation held its  fifth national conference in Hobart from 9-11 December, and  Mr West announced his decision in a speech at the opening

ceremony.  1  ,,
