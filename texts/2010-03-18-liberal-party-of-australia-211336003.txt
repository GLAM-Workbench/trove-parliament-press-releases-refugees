ALAN JONES:

Leader, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Something must be happening in Canberra with the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs polling. Every single attempt in the  Parliament seems to be to bash you up. How are you standing up to it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to develop a pretty thick skin in this business but Alan, yeah, it was interesting in the  Parliament yesterday. SomethingÃ¢ÂÂs upset them because they were getting very nasty and personal and the  Prime Minister was doing a lot of sledging across the table. I think it really demeans politicians when this  kind of thing happens but nevertheless IÃ¢ÂÂve always regarded as pretty axiomatic that the side that gets nasty  in the Parliament is the side that basically is running scared.

ALAN JONES:

And now Peter Costello.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, PeterÃ¢ÂÂs entitled to a view. I think his view is always worth listening to. I wish he was still in the  Parliament, Alan, but I respectfully disagree with him when it comes to paid parental leave.

ALAN JONES:

Well, let me just take this point. Robert Menzies in 1945. You are supposed to be betraying the Liberal  Party. I should point out to my listeners IÃ¢ÂÂm not a member of the Liberal Party but Robert Menzies talked  about “forgotten people” in 1945. You are saying, I presume, that the forgotten people today in 2010 are  mothers and fathers who want to have a child but canÃ¢ÂÂt afford to unless theyÃ¢ÂÂve got paid parental leave?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right and donÃ¢ÂÂt forget it was Bob Menzies back in 1941 in his first stint as Prime Minister who  introduced child endowment. It was the first time that government was radically concerned with the family  and I think that my paid parental leave scheme is entirely in keeping with the spirit and philosophy of Bob  Menzies. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs good for families, itÃ¢ÂÂs good for mothers and women and children and most of all, Alan,  itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be good for the economy because if you go back to Peter CostelloÃ¢ÂÂs Intergenerational Report it  talked about the 3 Ps, population, participation and productivity, and paid parental leave, it should boost the  birth rate, it should certainly boost womenÃ¢ÂÂs participation in the workforce and by keeping experienced  workers in their jobs it should boost productivity as well, so…

ALAN JONES:

People seem to have short memories, donÃ¢ÂÂt they? I mean, I remember, and I made this point on my  programme, 20 years ago I was in the vanguard of this argument with employers about superannuation.  They didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to buy that argument and Paul Keating forced everyone to save for their retirement. It was  a concept that had never been thought of before and hence compulsory superannuation. Big business  squealed then. Now youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about taxing some of the big business at a different rate. Now, there is  nothing new about taxing businesses at a different rate. In the UK companies earning less than Â£300,000 pay  25 per cent company tax; those with profits above Â£300,000 pay 29 per cent company tax. HowÃ¢ÂÂs any of this  new?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a fair point, Alan, and in the United States thereÃ¢ÂÂs also a differential rate of company tax and  much as the Coalition historically hates increasing taxes or charges, under the former government we  increased the Medicare levy temporarily to fund the guns buyback, we flagged an increased levy to fund the  Timor operation, there was a…

ALAN JONES:

And Peter Costello introduced a GST, didnÃ¢ÂÂt he?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yep, and there was the temporary surcharge on super to help fill Mr BeazleyÃ¢ÂÂs Budget black hole, so for  good reasons we sometimes increase levies, we sometimes increase charges, and I would much prefer, Alan,  to be able to fund a paid parental leave scheme without taxes and charges increasing anywhere, but the point  is everythingÃ¢ÂÂs got to be paid for. If it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt for LaborÃ¢ÂÂs shocking debt and deficit we would be able to do  this without this measure, but nevertheless if we want it any time soon I think the best way to get it is this  levy on the profits of larger businesses.

ALAN JONES:

So basically some companies will pay 30 cents in the dollar, some will pay 31.7. Peter Costello seems to  have forgotten in what he said yesterday that when he was in government he reduced the rate of company  tax from 36 to 30 per cent. Did Woolworths and Coles and other companies lower prices when the company

3

tax rate was reduced by six per cent? Indeed, since the reduction in taxes that was granted, Woolworths and  Coles increased supermarket prices faster than anywhere else in the world.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a fair point, Alan, and look, obviously itÃ¢ÂÂs much better to have a climate where taxes and charges are  going down and certainly the record of the Howard government overwhelmingly was that of a tax cutting  government, but as I said for very important purposes sometimes we have to face reality and say that this has  got to be funded and…

ALAN JONES:

Well, the public service offers, Mr RuddÃ¢ÂÂs own public service, paid maternity leave, that is, funded by taxes  on the private sector. So youÃ¢ÂÂve got small businesses, many run by women who are unable to afford to pay  their own staff or themselves maternity leave are actually being taxed to fund the maternity leave of the  public servants.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very good point and public servants get, I think, 12 weeks on full pay…

ALAN JONES:

Twelve weeks on full pay, quite.

TONY ABBOTT:

And they can get 24 weeks on half pay. Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a vastly better system than Mr Rudd is proposing for the  other mothers, working mothers of Australia, and what IÃ¢ÂÂm saying is that every person deserves real time at  real money and I canÃ¢ÂÂt understand why Mr Rudd, who hasnÃ¢ÂÂt even introduced his own paid parental leave  scheme into the Parliament, is arcing up about this. I think basically he feels gazumped.

ALAN JONES:

Just on that, he hasnÃ¢ÂÂt introduced it but he says it will definitely be in place by January 1.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right and he was complaining in the Parliament last week that we are obstructing his scheme and he  hasnÃ¢ÂÂt even put the legislation into the Parliament yet. So I think again, Alan, itÃ¢ÂÂs a sign that the Prime  Minister and the government are rattled and panicked that they are so hysterically reacting and often making  entirely false claims.

ALAN JONES:

Kristina Keneally has said that - this is on this health care thing - that if weÃ¢ÂÂve got a funding model thatÃ¢ÂÂs  solely focused on paying hospitals for each service they perform we run the risk of incentivising hospitals to  perform more procedures, then the focus of reform should be to keep people out of hospital. How is it  reform, because thereÃ¢ÂÂs a problem here of propaganda out there trying to persuade the electorate are they  aware of this grand reform programme but thereÃ¢ÂÂs nothing that anyone has said yet in the government that  provides another bed, another doctor, another nurse or another dollar at least before 2014.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, thatÃ¢ÂÂs right, Alan, I mean, Mr RuddÃ¢ÂÂs proposal wonÃ¢ÂÂt end the blame game and at least until 2014  thereÃ¢ÂÂs no extra money. Now, I think there is something to be said for giving hospitals more if they do more

4

but Mr RuddÃ¢ÂÂs scheme hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been properly thought through and one of the interesting features of the way  heÃ¢ÂÂs gone about this is that he didnÃ¢ÂÂt take anyone into his confidence. My understanding from inside the  public service, Alan, is that when it comes to negotiations between the Feds and the States here, the Feds are  basically shoving papers under their State counterpartsÃ¢ÂÂ doors at midnight and expecting the State people to  be able to give reasoned responses at eight oÃ¢ÂÂclock the next morning. Well, this is no way to conduct  discussions and negotiations over something as important as public hospitals and they should not be subject  to amateur hour experimentation which seems to be whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on at the moment with Mr Rudd.

ALAN JONES:

You asked the Prime Minister in Parliament this week to release reports that were made to Peter Garrett and  the Minister for Government Service Delivery, Mark Arbib, relating to the process of the insulation  programme from July to December last year. Mr Rudd is refusing, as I understand it, to release the briefings  that were provided to him and his Cabinet. Now, these were briefings given between November and  December. By that stage several insulation installers had died and there were growing safety concerns. Why,  I wonder, will Mr Rudd not release these reports?

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very good question. Why wonÃ¢ÂÂt he apologise to all the people whoÃ¢ÂÂve been affected, in some cases  tragically, by all of this? I think the sad thing is, Alan, that heÃ¢ÂÂs essentially a do-nothing Prime Minister but  what he does do he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do well and I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs this tremendous embarrassment throughout the  government at the way so many of these programmes but particularly the home insulation programme have  just gone so terribly, terribly wrong and I guess the first instinct of governments under these circumstances  is to cover up but invariably that makes a bad situation worse.

ALAN JONES:

YouÃ¢ÂÂre saying, are you not, that Mr Rudd would have received letters from the Environment Minister Peter  Garrett raising concerns about the programme? Mr Rudd is now saying he wonÃ¢ÂÂt release that correspondence  and you, Tony Abbott, should make Freedom of Information requests if you want the documents.

TONY ABBOTT:

My suspicion is that the reason why Peter Garrett hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been completely sacked is he is not nearly as  responsible as Mr Rudd is responsible and I think, in the end, it wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt surprise me if it comes out that  Peter Garrett did provide warnings to the Prime Minister and his office and the Prime Minister and his office  and Senator Arbib said Ã¢ÂÂlook, forget that, just get crackingÃ¢ÂÂ. Now, I suspect that is the real reason why Mr  Garrett remains in the Cabinet because they know that the person who is really responsible for all this is the  Prime Minister himself.

ALAN JONES:

1.1 million homes were insulated under this scheme. The governmentÃ¢ÂÂs only going to inspect 200,000. What  is going to happen to people who arenÃ¢ÂÂt given insurance on their homes because they havenÃ¢ÂÂt been inspected  and they may be carrying a risk that prevents them from being able to be offered insurance?







TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a very serious problem. We had a very senior Victorian fire chief yesterday saying that these roofs are  ticking time bombs. Now, thereÃ¢ÂÂs 1.1 million of them around Australia. Every single one of them really

5

should be inspected because thereÃ¢ÂÂs not just a problem of potential electrification of the foil roofs, thereÃ¢ÂÂs the  fire risk associated with improperly installed pink batts and other forms of insulation and unless this  checking is carried out, Alan, and until itÃ¢ÂÂs carried out, I think a lot of homes are going to be full of very  worried people.

ALAN JONES:

And the cost is monumental. I mean, the government has committed to inspecting 50,000 homes with  potentially lethal foil insulation - thatÃ¢ÂÂll be $50 million. ItÃ¢ÂÂs committed to spending another $50 million -  these are big lumps of money - to inspect 150,000 homes with potentially dodgy non-foil insulation. But the  governmentÃ¢ÂÂs conceding that at least 240,000 homes, not 150,000, have potentially had dodgy non-foil  insulation installed. I mean, are there people out there at risk because the government is doing nothing?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think a lot of people would be very anxious. I visited a home in Lyneham in Canberra yesterday, Alan,  where there was a ceiling fire as a result of the badly installed insulation. Now, this home has not been  officially inspected. The lady in question, she had to pay to get the thing rectified, she was $500 out of  pocket, sheÃ¢ÂÂs lost her insurance no-claim bonus and there still hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been an inspection of her home by the  government which was responsible for this mess in the first place.

ALAN JONES:

But at the rate of inspections at the moment, theyÃ¢ÂÂll be 30 years before these houses are inspected.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. I mean, this is the most monumental administrative disaster in Australian history. It really is  incompetence beyond belief. They put the insulation in at great expense and now theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to rip  much of it out at great expense. I mean, what an appalling waste of money and I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs every chance  this is going to be regarded as the Rudd governmentÃ¢ÂÂs real monument - monumental, colossal waste and  incompetence.

ALAN JONES:

Now, the thing is itÃ¢ÂÂs taking other people down with it. What are and what can you do for businesses by  exerting pressure, that have got a whole heap of stock sitting on the wharves. One business has written to me  telling me that in six more days, the total value of his stock of about half a million dollars will be reached in  detention charges which are accumulating at a rate of $50,000 a day. I mean, since the government made the  decision on Friday the 12th of March these businesses have been charged nearly a quarter of a million dollars  in detention charges. ShouldnÃ¢ÂÂt the government immediately step in and buy the stock and recompense these  people for the charges?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well certainly, Alan, governments have got to realise that…







ALAN JONES:

…excuse me for interrupting, IÃ¢ÂÂm with Tony Abbott the Leader of the Opposition. I will just stay with this.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs 7.30. Opposition Leader, go on.

TONY ABBOTT:

People make decisions in good faith based on the commitments that government makes or seems to make.  Now, if a government puts a programme in place and people legitimately say Ã¢ÂÂwell ok, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make  the most of this programme and provide services under this programmeÃ¢ÂÂ and they borrow money and invest  it, if government then changes the programme itÃ¢ÂÂs got to be conscious of the incredible loss it inflicts on  people and I think this is one of the difficulties with this government. Because no one in this government has  any experience much of being in business, they donÃ¢ÂÂt understand the consequences of their actions for  people in the real world.

ALAN JONES:

There must be people ringing you, there must be businesses in touch with you. I mean, is this the subject of a  matter of public importance whereby you have to alert the nation to the great default of the government in  burying people whoÃ¢ÂÂve often mortgaged their homes, their assets and whatever and now are left destitute.

TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a government whose word canÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem Alan. You do things based on the  commitment or the apparent commitment of this government and then when it suits the political purpose of  the government to do things differently, it lightly changes what happens and it leaves people suffering and  broken in its wake, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem weÃ¢ÂÂve got.

ALAN JONES:

So what can you do as the alternative Prime Minister for these people? What powers of persuasion do you  have to seek government intervention to save these peoplesÃ¢ÂÂ lives?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we can expose the problem, we can put pressure on the government to rectify the problem and we can  seek on behalf of the Australian people, justice from a government which doesnÃ¢ÂÂt always seem very  interested in that. Now, we canÃ¢ÂÂt undo the past and we have no magic wand but we can try to ensure that  people arenÃ¢ÂÂt left high and dry and look, Alan, to its credit the government has said that there will be  assistance packages for the people in business who have been impacted by this…

ALAN JONES:

But no one seems to be able to access that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well thatÃ¢ÂÂs the other problem, I mean actually making contact…

ALAN JONES:

…yeah. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve got no one to contact.



TONY ABBOTT:

…with the public service and getting decisions made is almost impossible. There are so many businesses  that havenÃ¢ÂÂt been paid for all sorts of things, that canÃ¢ÂÂt get on to people. I mean, it is a shambles but again,

7

this is a government which is all announcement and no follow-through, itÃ¢ÂÂs a government which seems to  lack the capacity to get things done. Mr Rudd is a Prime Minister who thinks that if you analyse the problem  and announce a solution, game over, problem solved. Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs the implementation which is the difference  between good government and very bad government and Mr Rudd has no capacity to implement the ideas  that he has.

ALAN JONES:

Just on migration policy, refugee policy, population policy. Are you aware of the deep concern that is  growing in the electorate about all of this? I mean, newspapers and websites and radio bulletins and the  government proclaim that authorities have intercepted another boat, or a boat has been intercepted. These  boats arenÃ¢ÂÂt being intercepted. I mean the smugglers and their customers know there are new rules and the  whole aim of their exercise is theyÃ¢ÂÂre seeking out Australian vessels. Their aim and their reason for  travelling is to get to Christmas Island and get a visa to live in Australia. Now, what on earth can you do to  prevent this whole catastrophe taking root to even a greater extent than it is?

TONY ABBOTT:

Alan, the most important thing is to say to the people smugglers and their customers that you donÃ¢ÂÂt get the  great prize of permanent residency just because you make it to Christmas Island.

ALAN JONES:

But you do under this government.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the point. Now, the Howard government brought in these temporary protection visas so if you get to  Christmas Island, are found to be a refugee, you still donÃ¢ÂÂt get permanent residency as a matter of course.

ALAN JONES:

And after the visa expired they had to apply for another one.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly, and some of them ended up going back and if the people smugglers havenÃ¢ÂÂt got a product they  wonÃ¢ÂÂt get the customers but Mr Rudd has given them a product by abolishing the temporary protection visas.  Now, we will put the temporary protection visas back in place. As well as that, thereÃ¢ÂÂll be rigorous  mandatory offshore processing. Mr RuddÃ¢ÂÂs watering that down by bringing people to Darwin now for  processing. We wonÃ¢ÂÂt conduct megaphone diplomacy with host and transit countries, we will try to do it  quietly behind the scenes and look, Mr Rudd promised before the election that he would turn boats around if  that was possible. He hasnÃ¢ÂÂt turned boats around and frankly, you need to have that in reserve as another  form of deterrence.

ALAN JONES:

Refugees will not undertake journeys at sea having paid people smugglers if they know there may be  rejection when they arrive. Now, how do you get that, as the alternative Prime Minister, into the heads of  these people to stop this whole…I mean, 1,200 of these people have arrived in 2010 alone and itÃ¢ÂÂs only  March.

TONY ABBOTT:

8

Exactly right. WeÃ¢ÂÂre on track, Alan, for a sad record, a record number of illegal arrivals and this all started  because the Prime Minister was incapable of leaving well enough alone. I mean John Howard, he was  heavily criticised at the time, the so-called Ã¢ÂÂdoctorsÃ¢ÂÂ wivesÃ¢ÂÂ abandoned him in droves because he had the  guts to do what was needed. He stopped the flow. Mr Rudd said Ã¢ÂÂoh look IÃ¢ÂÂm better than that. I can be  compassionate and keep the boat people awayÃ¢ÂÂ. Wrong, wrong, Mr Rudd. I mean, he made a big fellow of  himself in certain electorates but as a result of this, the boats have started coming again and sadly, people are  dying on the high seas because of this so-called compassion.

ALAN JONES:

Thanks for your time. WeÃ¢ÂÂll talk again soon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Alan.
