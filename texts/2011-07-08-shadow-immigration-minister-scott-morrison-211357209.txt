CHANNEL 10 MORNING NEWS WITH NATARSHA BELLING - PENNY WONG AND  SCOTT MORRISON

SUBJECT:  CLIMATE CHANGE; IMMIGRATION; LIVE EXPORTS.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



BELLING: Our weekly political debate this morning, Finance Minister Penny Wong and  shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison. Thanks to both of you for joining us this  morning.

WONG: Great to be here again.

BELLING: Let’s start with the carbon tax. Now I have a bit of a cartoon, which I’ll show to  the camera there. Now, it’s a bit of an analogy of exactly what’s going on with the carbon  tax. It was in yesterday’s Sydney Morning Herald, you can probably see it there. Basically  alluding to the fact that no Australian understands exactly what the carbon price is about.  Julia Gillard is set to set the record straight. Penny Wong, what is the carbon tax?

WONG: I think at its most simple, it is putting a price on pollution. And I think that people  understand intuitively that as long as something is free, we don’t tend to worry about it. If  we have to pay for it, or if a business has to pay for it, they do worry about it and they do try  and limit it.

And that, fundamentally, is what pricing carbon is about. And look I know it’s complicated;  it’s a whole of economy reform. It has been talked about for a long time. It’s actually been  talked about since 2006 - that’s when John Howard first started looking at this. And you  might recall he previously had a policy to put in place a price on carbon.

But we’re looking forward on Sunday to getting the detail out. And we will have the  opportunity to speak to the Australian people over the coming weeks and months about  what’s in the package. We do know it is complex, but it’s a policy that will work, and it’s an  important policy for the future of the country.

BELLING: Scott, your response?

MORRISON: This is a tax on the cost of living. This is a tax that’s going to impact on every  Australian. It’s a tax that the Prime Minister said she wouldn’t introduce before the last  election, and I think that’s one of the most significant points that Australians are angry  about. It’s a tax that literally goes on everything that moves, and the Government may seek  to try and say differently to that, but Penny is right, she’s right when she says that this is  designed to send a price signal to people to change their behaviour. I mean, that’s the point  of a carbon tax, and as a result, it means it will cost people more. And if the Government  says differently then there is no point to this tax whatsoever. So it is designed to make you  pay more in order to change your behaviour. That’s its purpose, that’s why costs will go up.

BELLING: There’s speculation, Penny, that this carbon announcement will be made on  Sunday, and then details of the ‘Malaysia solution’ will be slipped through. Is that correct?

WONG: All I know -

BELLING: Is that going to happen though?

WONG: I do know that the Prime Minister will be making an announcement on Sunday  about the carbon price. And if there’s an announcement in the near future about the  Malaysia deal that’s not something I’m in a position to indicate, that’s something Chris  Bowen will need to speak about.

But can I just respond to something Scott’s just said? And you saw what we’re going to get  a lot of in the coming weeks and months in these debates. This is going to be a very tough  debate, and we’re going to get Scott, Tony Abbott, everyone else from the Opposition out  there saying ‘the sky will fall in, this is a dreadful thing’. Fundamentally, what I’d say to  people is, have a look at the detail, have a look at what this means for you.

And understand climate change isn’t going to go away. We can keep saying we shouldn’t  do this. We can kick this can down the track. But I reckon in 5 or 10 or 20 years time, if we  look back, we’ll say ‘that was the right thing to do’, because we actually took some  responsibility for contributing less to climate change, for our children and our grandchildren.  And that’s what this is about.

BELLING: Scott, if I can mention to you, there’s even details in today’s Herald that actually  a $23 carbon tax will only cost the average household less than $10 a week. Surely that is  not too much to help save the climate and our planet.

MORRISON: Well I think that the second point that you’ve made is not established. I mean  the Government is going around and saying, and the Greens are going around saying, ‘this  carbon tax is going to save the Great Barrier Reef’. Now, we all know that’s nonsense,  that’s not going to happen as a result of this carbon tax -

WONG: Well why did you previously support it?

MORRISON: What we’re going to see is cost of living-

WONG: You’ve previously supported this.

MORRISON: The cost of living is going to go up, that is the purpose of the Government’s  carbon tax, to drive up the cost of living, to change people’s behaviour. I mean, that’s why  they’re going to do it, and if they think this is going to change the world’s temperatures. I  think that Barnaby Joyce put it best, I mean, if taxes actually cooled the globe, then we’d be  living in an icebox.

And I don’t think that the Government can go out there and automatically claim that the  world’s temperature is going to change simply because Australia puts on a carbon tax  which is going to hit small business, it’s going to hit families. And people need to  understand the detail, and when they do, they don’t like it now, and the more they know  about it, the more they’re not going to like it.

WONG: Can I just respond to that? First, John Howard used to support this and he  supported it because it was sensible policy. The Coalition used to support this, they used to  support it when they were led by people who actually cared about sensible policy, now they  just want to say no and run scare campaigns.

In terms of what the assistance will be. We’ve said nine out of ten households in Australia  will get assistance - nine out of ten, that’s some 7 million Australian households. What  we’ve also said is that lower income households, around 3 million of them, will get more  than the average cost impact. Because we’re a Labor Government and we want to make  sure this is implemented fairly.  Now we can continue to say simply this is a bad thing, we  don’t want to do this. Or we can say, climate change is real, we need to put our fair share  towards dealing with it, because we do care what happens in the future.

BELLING: Can I just quickly move on, unfortunately -

MORRISON: Let me just respond to that point. Both parties have policies to deal with  climate change.

WONG:  Yours cost more.

MORRISON: This isn’t about climate change

WONG: Yes it is -

MORRISON: It’s about the Government’s carbon tax. And what we’ve seen with the carbon  tax, even this week they couldn’t tell us because they’re going to take it off petrol, how  much they’re going to put in other areas. They couldn’t even tell us whether it applies to  petrol going in a bus and what’s it going to cost on public transport fares. And other costs of  transport logistics that take the food to the grocery shops where you buy it.

WONG: Scott -

MORRISON: Now these are all questions the Government are going to have to explain and  we look forward to having that discussion.

WONG: Barnaby Joyce has described your policy as a ‘meaningless gesture’, a  ‘meaningless gesture’ which - let me finish.

MORRISON: (Inaudible) Well -

WONG:  I let you finish, barely, but I did eventually. (laughter)  Barnaby Joyce has  described your policy as a meaningless gesture, it cost $30 billion. You’re either going to  have to get that either out of the budget or via more taxes.

MORRISON: It’s not going to cost $30 billion Penny, you know that.

WONG: That’s what the advice is.

BELLING: We are going to have to move on because I think it’s going to be clear as mud  on Sunday.

WONG: Absolutely.

MORRISON: I think that’s true.

BELLING: In regards to the other big political issue, the situation with animal cruelty,  alleged animal cruelty, re-establishing the trade with Indonesia. Penny we’ve seen a  number of Labor backbenchers come out and criticise the Government’s stance. Is it too  early to move on or re-establish trade and what guarantees have you got that animal cruelty  won’t continue?

WONG: I think anybody who watched that Four Corners program was appalled. And I think  what it did do, as Australians we said we don’t want, whatever our views on the live export  trade, and there are many different views in the community. But people said look we don’t  want that kind of cruelty to simply to occur, we want something done about it.

We know this is an important industry but we do think you have to deal with the standards  issue. And what Joseph Ludwig has announced is agreement to international standards  being applied, independent auditing of abattoirs where these animals go, traceability, so we  know where animals go and all of this to be enforced through regulations via the export  permit system. None of those things were in place before.

Now I know, not just some Labor MPs but many people in the community have different  views about this, and what I’d say to them is these are the things the Government has  done. That’s a very significant advance on where we were.

BELLING: Quickly, we’ve got a minute left, Scott go.

MORRISON: This is another example of where the Government completely overreacted.  They didn’t act, I think, soberly on this issue. There are issues to address but they didn’t  have to suspend the trade immediately. The trade could have continued.

They may have recommenced and lifted the ban, but restoring that trade will be very  difficult. Cattle farmers across Northern Australia have been devastated by this because  this Government acted in a knee jerk reaction just like we’ve seen on so many issues, and  that’s why we say they’re the most incompetent government since Scullin can’t be trusted  with the biggest change through the carbon tax.

And that’s what it’s going to mean. This Government is going to introduce the carbon tax  and implement it. And what they’ve done on pink batts and school halls and asylum  seekers.

WONG: Why don’t you debate the policy? This is just a political line.

MORRISON: This is what we’re going to see. They won’t be trusted. This is what people  are looking at.

WONG: This is typical Tony Abbott - you just do negativity, negativity - no, no, no, no.  Argue the policy. I’ll come back here any day and argue the policy here with you.

BELLING: You’re both very eager for a break, the parliamentary break. We won’t see you  for a couple of weeks. I’m so sorry, we’ve run out of time once again.

WONG: Good to speak with you.

BELLING: Have a lovely weekend, look forward to the big announcement next Saturday  and we’ll see you next time in a couple of weeks.

WONG: Next time.

MORRISON: Thanks so much.
