TRANSCRIPT THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

CAPITAL HILL - LYNDAL CURTIS ABC 24 WEDNESDAY 24 JULY 2013

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Joe Hockey, welcome to Capital Hill. If I can go first to a statement from the Papua New Guinean  High Commissioner who has warned Australian politicians “to observe international protocols and  courtesies when discussing relations with other friendly sovereign nations and not impugn the  dignity of our leaders who are attempting to assist Australia in solving the complex issue of asylum  seekers”. Do you believe that statement is directed at comments by Opposition MPs, including Tony  Abbott, on foreign aid?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think the Coalition and all Australian politicians have been very respectful of the relationships we  have with Papua New Guinea and other jurisdictions as well. But let me say this - under the  Coalition there will be no blank cheques from Australian taxpayers to any other country, let alone  citizens here within Australia. There are no blank cheques and whether it be on foreign aid or be it  any other area, Australian taxpayers deserve to have proper accountability in the expenditure of  taxpayers' money.

PRESENTER:

But that will not, presumably, exclude discussing with the foreign nation to which Australia's aid is  going, what their priorities are and where they would like to see the money spent?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think it is important to have those discussions. But it is also important that there be a level of  accountability to the Australian taxpayers that are writing out the cheques in foreign aid. We need to  ensure - and the Coalition will ensure - that foreign aid is not used improperly, nor should foreign aid

be used for the political whim of any one Australian Government. Frankly there will be no blank  cheques from the Coalition on foreign aid or anything else because we have more respect for  taxpayers than the current Government does.

PRESENTER:

But the Federal Government hasn't been talking, has it, about sending blank cheques? The Papua  New Guinea Prime Minister was simply saying that they will have a greater role in setting the  priorities and the Australian Government says these are two-way discussions.

JOE HOCKEY:

Obviously this is a trade-off for part of the deal with refugees that Mr Rudd has announced. The fact  with Mr Rudd is that when he makes the grand announcements, there is always a hell of a lot behind  it and I think as each day passes, like peeling an onion, we are discovering more about Mr Rudd's  secret deals.

PRESENTER:

We might go to the economy.  The figures out on inflation show inflation is pretty well contained.  Do you think that will give scope for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it certainly does give the Reserve Bank room to move. The fact is if the Reserve Bank does cut  interest rates, it is not because the economy is doing well, it is because the economy is under-performing. Certainly it is not helped by the Government, which is just behaving in such a reckless  manner at the moment. The fact that the Government is leaking out a deteriorating Budget position  to individual media outlets is reprehensible because it is undermining business and consumer  confidence and creates the view that the Government doesn't know what it is doing.

PRESENTER:

I did check with the Treasurer's office about that figure that was in this morning's newspapers about  a $6 billion write down. They say it didn't come from them. They will be releasing an economic  statement before the election is called. What do you think that statement should say?

JOE HOCKEY:

First of all they should release the economic statement now - right now. If the Treasurer's office says  these figures did not come from them, why is the Treasury leaking on the Government? Why is the  Prime Minister’s office leaking on the Government? Because these figures are coming from  somewhere. It is not one isolated incident. It is in a number of media outlets. The deterioration in  revenue has been background briefed to a number of media outlets. You see, they don't get it. Kevin  Rudd said he's governing but what he is doing is selectively leaking, which is further undermining  business and consumer confidence. If the Government can't properly run the Budget, they certainly  can't properly run the economy.

PRESENTER:

If another interest rate fall is a sign of a deteriorating economy, does that mean any interest rate falls  under a Coalition Government could be read the same way?

JOE HOCKEY:

It depends on what the economic growth is. If - as we did have under the Coalition - consistent  economic growth of trend or higher and interest rates are coming down then that would reflect, in  part, competition. On average, under the Coalition interest rates have been lower than, on average,  under Labor. But the fact is that we have got a deteriorating economy. Economic growth is much  slower than what the Government originally forecast and it is slower than what they forecast just a  few weeks ago in the Budget. What we are getting is a very clear picture that every time the  Government produces numbers about the state of the Budget they are wrong, and they are wrong in  the wrong direction. They are always worse than what the Government forecast.

PRESENTER:

If the economic statement, as the Government says it will be, is produced before the election,  presumably that would be pretty close to what the Treasury itself will release in the election and will  it be a statement that you could start producing your numbers on, start producing your costings  against?

JOE HOCKEY:

We have always consistently said we will wait for the Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook which is produced  by the Secretaries of the Treasury and the Department of Finance. This is all pre-election spin from  Labor, it is just typical. They are trying to play political games of boxing the Secretary of the  Treasury into a position during the course of the election campaign. I just treat it as more spin and  more smoke from Labor.

PRESENTER:

You have been critical of the Government's decision to change the FBT rules on cars. Isn't it simply  asking those who are claiming the tax deduction to say for three months out of every five years to  prove that they have a right to that money?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is not that simple. The Government is spinning a line that is inconsistent. At first they said there  was rorting and that is what Mr Bowen said. Then Bill Shorten said that there is no rorting and then  today Kevin Rudd said there is rorting and there are loopholes. The fact is the Government had a  process. They had a Henry Tax Review that identified that FBT on motor vehicles needed to be  changed so that you wouldn't rely on the number of kilometres travelled in order to work out your  FBT liability. They said they would come in with a statutory 20%, which would make it much  simpler for people that were having it claimed as part of their package. They introduced that and now  they say there is widespread rorting. That has come out of left field. They have given no proof - no  proof whatsoever - that there is rorting. By the way, quite obviously it is the case that the

Government has got its figures wrong because the Government claimed, as the Deputy Prime  Minister did the other day, the people benefiting are driving Audis and Mercedes Benz where in fact  only 5% of the people driving those sort of cars. 75% of the people that are claiming it - salary  packaging a motor vehicle are, in fact, earning less than $100,000 a year and most of them are  driving cars of $30,000 to $40,000 of value. They have got figures wrong, how can you trust Labor  on anything?

PRESENTER:

If I can ask you one final question. Labor is running an ad from tonight using a graph that it has used  before showing Australia's net debt compared to other economies including a couple in our region - Korea and Japan - showing Australia's net debt is low. That is not inaccurate, is it?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is misguided spin from Kevin Rudd. He is so desperate on the issue of debt and deficit that he is  running these sorts of ads which don't tell the full story. The fact is that under Kevin Rudd we had  the fastest growth in Government debt in modern Australia history.

PRESENTER:

But it grew much faster in a lot of other countries?

JOE HOCKEY:

Under Kevin Rudd - who inherited $70 billion of net assets - we are now facing debt that will exceed  $300 billion. I say to Kevin Rudd, if you are not concerned about the level of debt of Australia, come  clean with the Australian people and tell us exactly when you plan to increase the self-imposed $300  billion debt limit that Labor imposed and what you are going to increase the Government debt to?  Because you know one thing about Kevin Rudd, he knows how to use the nation's credit card. He's  done it before, he'll do it again. He knows how to smoke the taxpayers' credit card. Kevin Rudd is  seeking now a blank cheque to go on a spending spree before the election just as he is seeking blank  cheque in relation to foreign aid.

PRESENTER:

On that note Joe Hockey we will have to leave it. Thank you very much for your time.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thank you, Lyndal.
