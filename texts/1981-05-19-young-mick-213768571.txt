PRESS RELEASE FROM MR MICK YOUNG, MP, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS Ã¢ÂÂ

"The newly appointed Australian Council on Population and Ethnic  Affairs is lacking in people with expertise specifically on ethnic  affairs", Mr Mick Young, the Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs said today.

The new Council was appointed following the recomendations of the  "Razor Gang" to abolish the Australian Population and Immigration  Council, the Australian Refugee Advisory Council and the Australian  Ethnic Affairs Council.

Members of the Council seem to have been selected on the basis of  their support for the Government's immigration policies rather than  on their past performance, expertise and the capability to provide  sound advice to the Minister.

The vast majority of the appointees will no doubt support higher  levels of skilled immigration.

"Seven of the 18 members are either company executives or representatives  of various industries and employer groups", Mr Young said.

'There are another 6 academics mainly with an economic background.

Only two people on the Council have a trade union background, and only  one - the representative of the Jewish Community - was selected on the  basis of her association with the community". Mr Young said.
