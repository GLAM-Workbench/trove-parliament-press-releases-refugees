LEBANON

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Tony Street MP, said

today that the Australian Government was appalled at the  massacre of Palestinian civilians in refugee camps in West  Beirut at the weekend.

Mr Street said that Australians were aware of the tragic

burden of death and destruction which the people of Lebanon  had been forced to endure in recent months. He said, "The

assassination of the President-elect of Lebanon Mr Gemayel,  and the shocking massacre of the wee k e n d  are serious setbacks  to the cause of peace in Lebanon. Those responsible must be

condemned."

The Minister noted that the re-entry of Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) into Beirut had been explained in terms of the need to

maintain peace. "By re-entering Beirut the IDF took on itself

the responsibility for the protection of the civilian population.  It is a matter of grave concern that the massacre of Palestinian

civilians occurred while Israeli forces were in the immediate  area," Mr Street said.

Mr Street recalled that in his statement of 9 August the

Prime Minister had made clear Australia's grave concern at the  continued fighting and destruction in Lebanon and the need for  a political solution that w o u l d  enable the people of that war-torn  country to live their lives in peace. The Mini s t e r  said that the

Government believed that all foreign forces should withdraw from  L e b a n o n .
