Abstract

Â

This paper presents key findings 
from the first and second phases of the Family Responses to Youth Allowance 
survey. The survey, part of the broader evaluation of Youth Allowance, 
sought to examine the impact on the attitudes, expectations, perceptions 
and behavioural responses of young people and their parents. The survey 
found that: (1) the majority of parents support the principle of parental 
means testing, but the government was generally seen as having most 
responsibility for unsupported young people (2) the impact of the extension 
of parental means testing does not appear to be significant; (3) generally, 
the higher the parents income, the less likely they are to support parental 
means testing, but parents who have the financial capacity are more 
likely to be providing support and to be more accepting of young people 
remaining at home until they are financially independent; and (4) the 
level of support provided was greater for young people aged 16-17, still 
living at home, full-time students, and with annual parental income 
between $40,000 to $60,000.

Â

Background

Â

Youth Allowance

Â

Youth Allowance 
was introduced on 1 July 1998 in response to a number of concerns about 
income support provisions for young people, most notably: the changing 
labour market; the need for simplicity and flexibility; and the need 
to minimise financial disincentives for young people to undertake further 
education.

Â

One of the 
main changes to income support arrangements under Youth Allowance was 
the introduction of a parental means test for unemployed 18-20 year 
olds. Prior to 1 July 1998, dependent young people applying for AUSTUDY 
or Youth Training Allowance were subject to a parental means test. In 
contrast, there was no parental means test for Newstart Allowance. Unemployed 
young people aged 18 years and older received Newstart Allowance at 
levels determined by their own income/assets situation, regardless of 
the income and assets of their parents.

Â

The Youth 
Allowance parental means test aligns income support arrangements for 
students and other young people and reflected existing arrangements 
for under 18 year olds receiving Youth Training Allowance. This measure 
removed a potential disincentive to study and reinforced the Government’s 
philosophy that, where they have the means to do so, families should 
support young people until they are financially independent.

Â

Youth Allowance 
Evaluation

Â

Youth Allowance 
is being evaluated over a three-year period. One of the major evaluation 
questions seeks to assess the impact of Youth Allowance on young people 
and their families, including the extent to which Youth Allowance results 
in parents accepting greater responsibility for their children until 
they reach financial independence. The main source of data for this 
project is the   Family Responses 
to Youth Allowance Survey  .

Â

The Survey

Â

The Department 
of Family and Community Services commissioned social research consultants 
to undertake survey work to assess the impact of Youth Allowance on 
the attitudes, expectations, perceptions and behavioural responses of 
young people and their parents. The research sought to explore the perceived 
roles of family and government in financially supporting young people 
and to determine any changes in attitudes and behavioural responses 
over time.

Â

Specifically, 
the key areas examined were:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â attitudes 
to responsibility for financial support of young people;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â parental 
support;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â young 
people and financial independence; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â participation 
in education and the labour market.

Â

Â

Methodology

Â

First phase 
(1999)

Â

The research 
consisted of   qualitative   and   quantitative   components.

Â

Qualitative 
research

Â

Six group 
discussions were conducted: four with young people who were no longer 
eligible for Youth Allowance or who were on a reduced rate of Youth 
Allowance because of the parental means test and two with parents of 
young people in similar circumstances. The focus groups involved young 
people of varying ages, residency (living away from home or at home), 
gender, activity status (full-time student, job seeker, employed), and 
geographic area (Sydney’s western suburbs and regional Queensland).

Â

The main 
purpose of the focus groups was to explore attitudes, motivation and 
behaviour in order to inform the development of the survey questionnaire. 
Findings presented from Phase 1 will be generally confined to the results 
of quantitative research.

Â

Quantitative 
research

Â

While the 
qualitative phase focused on young people and parents affected by the 
extension of parental means testing to unemployed 18-20 year olds, the 
quantitative phase sought to provide the views of a broader range of 
young people and parents.

Â

For this 
phase, a large-scale telephone survey was conducted with 831 young people 
aged 15-24 and 799 parents of young people aged 16-24. The young people 
were either: Youth Allowance customers; Newstart Allowance customers 
aged 18-20 years who had been ‘grandfathered’   1   or former Youth Allowance customers.   2

Â

It should 
be noted that Centrelink does not collect contact details for parents 
of Youth Allowance recipients. For this survey, contact with parents 
was made through young people. However, in the interests of privacy 
and family harmony, no attempts were made to contact the parents of 
Youth Allowance recipients who had been assessed as "unreasonable 
to live at home"    3  . Therefore, the survey is unable to present their 
views.

Â

A small-scale 
telephone survey of 145 parents (receiving Family Allowance) whose eldest 
child was aged 13-15 years was also conducted to assess their awareness 
of Youth Allowance measures, and their reactions to, and plans for, 
the prospect of providing for their young person until the age of 21 
or 25.

Â

After a 
pilot survey of 160 interviews, the main survey was conducted nationally 
across metropolitan, rural and regional areas. Interviews lasted for 
approximately 15 minutes.

Â

Second phase 
(2000)

Â

Having gathered 
baseline data in the first phase, the second sought to test any changes 
in attitude and examine particular groups in more depth.

Â

Questionnaire 
pilots

Â

Focus groups 
were conducted with young people and parents to fine-tune the questionnaire. 
The purpose of the focus groups was to test the overall flow of the 
questionnaires and respondents’ understanding of the questions. Based 
on the outcomes of the focus groups, the questionnaire was revised and 
then pilot tested through telephone interviews with 30 young people 
and 30 parents.

Â

Telephone 
survey

Â

The main 
telephone survey was undertaken with 1,027 young people aged 15-24 and 
1,001 parents. As in the first phase, the sample comprised: Youth Allowance 
customers; grandfathered Newstart Allowance customers aged 18-20 years; 
former Youth Allowance customers; and parents of young people from these 
categories. In the second phase, the increased sample size is due to 
the inclusion of young people and parents from blended families. This 
was done to further explore issues that had been raised earlier in community 
consultations.    4   Also in the second phase, an attempt was made 
to contact parents of ‘unreasonable to live at home’ customers.

Â

As with 
Phase 1, another survey of 100 parents receiving Family Allowance whose 
eldest child was aged 13-15 years was conducted. The survey also explored 
the views of a new group who were entitled to Family Allowance as a 
result of eligibility changes from 1 October 1999.   5   Of this group, 120 parents receiving Family Allowance 
and 80 young people aged 16-24 attracting Family Allowance were interviewed.

Â

Case studies

Â

A more in-depth 
look at attitudes to financial support by particular groups was undertaken. 
These included:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Former 
Youth Allowance customers   Â This 
group includes young people previously receiving income support (Newstart 
Allowance/Youth Allowance) and have had benefits   cancelled   (or removed) on or after 1 July 1998 or cancelled 
from Youth Allowance due to the parental means test or the young person’s 
earnings. This also includes young people who lodged a claim for income 
support but were   rejected   because of high earnings or parental means test 
reasons. The purpose of these case studies was to understand the impact 
of the changed arrangements on the household/parent/young person.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Step-parent 
families

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Parents 
of young people assessed as independent on the basis of ‘unreasonable 
to live at home’   Â This 
was confined to parents of young people assessed as ‘unreasonable to 
live at home’ due to ‘extreme family breakdown’. Case studies did 
not include parents of young people assessed as ‘unreasonable to live 
at home’ due to violence or abuse.

Â

Â

Key Findings

Â

The key 
findings presented are from the main survey of young people aged 15-24 
and parents from Phases 1 and 2. The Phase 2 data on young people and 
parents receiving Family Allowance and on case studies were not available 
at the time of writing this paper.

Â

Attitudes 
to financial support of young people

Â

Financial 
responsibility

Â

There were 
differences in views between young people and parents in terms of responsibility 
for financial support of young people aged 18 years and over who are 
unable to support themselves. Views differed depending on the activity 
of the young person (see Figures 1-4).

Â

These charts 
show:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â there 
was little change in the parents’ and young people’s views on financial 
responsibility for young people Â the most notable is a slight shift 
in parental perceptions towards the   government   (rather than parents) being seen as most responsible 
for all unsupported young people;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â in both 
phases, the   government   was seen as most responsible for financially 
supporting job seekers; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â there 
were mixed views on supporting students Â in Phase 1, the majority 
of young people saw the government as most responsible for students    while   parents perceived themselves as most responsible 
for students.   In Phase 
2,   both   young people and parents perceived the   government   as most responsible for students. However, it appears parents still 
see themselves as bearing a   major   responsibility for supporting students.

Â

Both parents and young people agreed that   all three parties (government, parents and young people) have some 
responsibility   for financially supporting young people aged 18    or 
over who are unable to support themselves.

Â

The views of parents also varied slightly, depending on the level 
of their annual income. These are shown in Tables 1 to 4.

Â

Young people’s attitudes to financial support depended on parental 
income levels and expectations of parental support. Where parental income 
is low, young people’s expectations of parents were lower and those 
of government higher. On the other hand, young people with parents who 
had higher incomes placed more responsibility on their parents for support 
and less on government.

Â

Attitudes to Parental Means Test

Â

In both phases, parents were asked whether they generally agreed or 
disagreed with government payments for young people being means tested 
according to the income and assets of the young person’s parents. As 
Table 5 shows, there is overall support for the principle of parental 
means testing.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â In Phase 1,   59 per cent   of parents of those aged 16 or over   agreed   or   strongly 
agreed  .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Similarly,   60 per cent   of parents in Phase 2 either   agreed   or   strongly 
agreed  .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Those   more likely   to support parental means testing were parents of Dependent Youth 
Allowance recipients and parents receiving government payments or those 
on low incomes (ie under $23,800 per annum).

Â

In Phase 2, parents were asked to state the reasons for agreeing or 
disagreeing with the parental means test. The most frequently nominated 
reasons are listed in Table 6.

Â

payments for young people should be parentally means tested

Â

Agree with parental means test because:

Disagree 
  with parental means test because:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â It 
  is parents’ responsibility to pay

Youths 
  are independent after a certain age/ at age 18/ after they have moved 
  out

Parents 
  who can afford/wealthy parents should pay

Should 
  go on the child’s income not the parents’

Lower 
  income families can’t afford to pay

Means 
  test is unfair/ expensive to bring up kids/ high costs of living/ unfair 
  if you have large assets but small income

Stops 
  rorting/abuse of the system

Everybody 
  should get it regardless

Â

Also in Phase 2, parents were asked to nominate ways (if any) in which 
the current parental means test could be changed to suit family circumstances. 
The most frequently mentioned were:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Change the income basis   Â base it on current, not past income; should not have to predict 
income; should be based on net income, not gross;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Change the asset basis   Â base it on income but not assets; assets testing should not include 
business assets/farms; should not apply to retirement savings/investments;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Raise limits at which benefits are reduced  ;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Make testing tougher for rich people  ; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Take into account family circumstances  .

Â

In Phase 2, young people were also asked about their views of parental 
means testing. In contrast to parents, most young people (  66 per cent  ) either   disagreed   or   strongly 
disagreed   with the parental means test (see Table 7). Those who were more likely 
to   disagree   were Youth Allowance customers 
who were assessed as ‘Independent’ because of prior workforce criteria 
or other reasons (eg in State care, orphan, refugee, etc); or young 
people aged 18 and over.

Â

However, when young people aged 18 and over were asked whether the 
parental means test had been a source of tension within the family,   61 per cent   reported it had not. Where 
it was reported to have been a source of tension,   57 per cent   said it caused a ‘little’ tension, while   40 per cent   stated it caused ‘considerable’ tension.

Â

Parental support

Â

Parental willingness to provide and support provided

Â

The survey canvassed views on parental willingness to provide support 
and the level of support currently provided. In general, while parents 
who have higher incomes are less likely to support parental means testing, 
where they perceive that their young person is in need they were more 
likely to be willing to provide support, and to be actually providing 
support if government support is unavailable or limited.

Â

In general, parents who have higher incomes and who perceive that 
their young person is in need were more likely to be willing to provide, 
and to be actually providing support if government support is unavailable 
or limited.

Â

The level of support provided, in financial and other terms, was generally 
greater for those who:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â were younger (aged 16-17);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â were Youth Allowance recipients or ineligible for Youth Allowance;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â were still living at home;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â were full-time students; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â with annual parental income in the $40,000 to $60,000 range.

Â

Discrepancies in perceptions between willingness to provide support 
and actual support provided are illustrated in Figures 5-8.

Â

Financial Support

Â

Parents and young people were asked whether or not young people were 
given financial support in the form of cash.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â Most young people (  68 per cent   in Phase 1 and   52 per cent   in Phase 2) reported that their parents did   not   give 
them any money. In Phase 2, 32 per cent reported that they received 
less than $50 while 6 per cent reported they received between $50 and 
$99.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â In Phase 1, only   45 per cent   of parents reported that they gave money while in Phase 2,   60 per cent   of parents reported they 
did. Of the 60 per cent, 16 per cent gave regular payments and 80 per 
cent only gave occasionally (when urgently needed). Of those who gave 
cash   regularly  , 72 per cent gave less 
than $50 and 16 per cent gave between $50-$99. Of those who gave cash   occasionally  , 64 per cent gave under 
$50 while 21 per cent gave between $50-$99.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â In both phases, young people who were likely to receive cash from 
parents were: those aged 16-17; full-time students; and dependent young 
people.

Â

Young people and financial independence

Â

Feelings about parental support

Â

Young people reported their ‘main’ sources of income as:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â government payments;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â parents;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â casual work;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â full-time work; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â part-time work.

Â

However, a slightly larger proportion of young people in Phase 2 nominated 
‘parents’ as a ‘main’ source of income.

Â

Given that parents were either a ‘main’ or ‘other’ source of income, 
young people were asked how they felt about this parental support. Half 
were positive about this. This is detailed in Table 8.

These young people were also asked about their perception of the ‘burden’ 
this placed on their parents. Around half of the young people saw this 
support as ‘a heavy financial burden’ or ‘something of a financial 
burden’ on their parents (Table 9).

Steps towards financial independence

Â

In Phase 1, the majority (82%) of young people reported taking steps 
towards financial independence between June 1998 and 1999. The activity 
most commonly nominated by young people who did take steps towards financial 
independence was seeking casual work (28%).

Â

In Phase 2, young people were asked whether they felt ‘more’ or 
‘less’ financially independent in the last 12 months.   Fifty-two per cent   of young people reported 
that they felt ‘more’ financially independent, 8 per cent reported 
they felt ‘less’ financially independent, and 39 per cent reported 
they felt ‘about the same’.

Â

For those who reported feeling ‘more’ financially independent, the 
most frequently nominated steps taken to be more financially independent 
were:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â sought/took work;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â planned a budget;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â got Youth Allowance;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â moved out of home; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â supported myself.

Â

The most frequently cited reasons for feeling ‘less’ financially 
independent were:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â lost or reduced Youth Allowance or income support;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â lost work;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â now studying/going to colleges of technical and further education;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â have more expenses; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â moved back home.

Â

Living arrangements

Â

The survey also examined living arrangements of young people in a 
12-month period. In both phases, most young people (around 75 per cent) 
were reported to be living at home with parents. Other frequently cited 
living arrangements were: with friends; with other relatives; in a group 
house; with boyfriend/girlfriend; or in student accommodation.

Â

In the first phase, a substantial proportion of young people (  43 per cent  ) reported that they had 
moved in the 12-month period. In the second phase around   30 per cent   of young people were reported 
to have moved. Of those who moved, 25 per cent did so to live with/move 
with parents, around 25 per cent with friends, 14 per cent with other 
relatives and around 20 per cent in a group house.

Â

The main reasons for moving were varied. The most common, especially 
in Phase 2, were: to be closer to study/work; disagreement with parents; 
and to be more independent. These are detailed in Table 10.

Moving out of home

Â

Parents and young people were asked when young people should move 
out. In both phases, parents of young people   still living at home   stated that they   would like    young 
people to move    out   when they: are financially 
independent; have a full-time job/are employed; are ready/want to; can 
afford their own place; or are in a relationship/married.

Â

However, most parents realise that   young people    are 
likely to move out   when they: are financially independent; have finished their studies; 
have a full-time job; or can afford it. The average age that these young 
people were likely to leave home was   21   years.

Â

Most parents whose young person had   already moved out   of the family home would have liked their young person to move out 
when they: had finished their studies; were financially independent; 
had a full-time job; were in a relationship/married; and were ready/wanted 
to. The average age that these young people had left home was   17.6   years.

Â

The factors found to influence parental acceptance of young people 
staying at home until they reached financial independence were the   level of parental incom  e and the   age, type and level of income support received by the young person  . That is, parents who 
were more accepting were those: on higher annual incomes (ie $40,000 
- $60,000); living in urban areas; whose young person was aged 16-17 
years, assessed as "dependent" under Youth Allowance or receiving 
minimal or no income support.

Â

Young people   still living at home   perceived that their parents   would like them to move out   when they: had finished studying; were financially independent; had 
a full-time job/were employed; in a relationship/married; can afford 
their own place; and were ready/wanted to.

Â

Young people still living at home thought they would   actually move out   when they: had a full-time job/ were employed; had finished their 
studies; were financially independent; and can afford their own place. 
The average age at which this was likely to occur, according to young 
people, was   20.7   years.

Â

Young people who   had moved out of home   reported that   parents would have liked them to move   when they (the young people): wanted to; moved away to study; at 
a specific age; or at a particular time. A few young people reported 
they did not want to leave at all. The average age at which these young 
people had left home was   17.5   years.

Â

In general, young people perceived that parents were more likely to 
accept them staying at home until they achieved financial independence 
if they were Dependent Youth Allowance recipients or they were receiving 
minimal or low government payments. It also appears that the expected 
age of leaving home is increasing, consistent with ABS data which shows 
an increasing proportion of young adults in their twenties living in 
the parental home.

Summary of findings

Â

In summary:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â perceptions of financial responsibility for young people are quite 
complex and varied Â perceptions depend in part on the young person’s 
age, activity, and the financial capacity of parents;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â the majority of parents support the principle of parental means 
testing (59 per cent in Phase 1 and 60 per cent in Phase 2);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â although the Government, parents, and young people were seen as 
having   some   responsibility 
for unsupported young people, there was a shift in perceptions between 
the two phases. In the second phase the Government was generally seen 
as   most   responsible for all young 
people who are unable to support themselves;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â the impact of the extension of parental means testing does not 
appear to be significant:

Ã¢ÂÂÂ most parents supported parental means testing, particularly those 
on lower incomes. Those on higher income levels were more likely to 
disagree but were more likely to be providing support to young people 
and were more likely to accept young people staying at home until they 
achieved financial independence;

Ã¢ÂÂÂ only one in three young people supported parental means testing 
Â those more likely to strongly disagree were young people assessed 
as Independent due to workforce criteria or other reasons and young 
people aged 18 or over;

Ã¢ÂÂÂ although few young people supported parental means testing, most 
young people reported it had not been a source of family stress/tension;

Ã¢ÂÂÂ around half of the young people were ‘accepting’ or ‘happy’ 
about receiving support from their parents.

  Notes

Â

1   ‘Grandfathered’ Newstart Allowance customers are those young people 
who were receiving Newstart Allowance on 10 June 1997 (the date Youth 
Allowance was announced) and were in continuous receipt of Newstart 
Allowance as at 1 July 1998. Â   
Â  
   2   ‘Former Youth Allowance 
customers’ includes those who were no longer eligible because of the 
level ofparental income or the young person’s income. Â   
Â  
   3   ‘Unreasonable to live 
at home’ means the person cannot live at the home of either or both 
of his or her parents because: of   extreme family breakdown   or other similar circumstances; or it would be unreasonable to expect 
the person to do so as there would be   a serious risk to his or her physical or mental well-being   due to violence, sexual 
abuse or other similar unreasonable circumstances; or parents are unable 
to provide the person with a suitable home because they lack stable 
accommodation. In addition, the person is not receiving: continuous 
support from a parent or guardian; or any payments in the nature of 
income support from the Commonwealth, a State or Territory. Young people 
are independent (ie not subject to the parental means test) if they 
have been assessed as ‘unreasonable to live at home’.Â   
Â  
   4   During community consultations 
in April-June 1999, most of those consulted were of the view that the 
extension of parental means testing had a significant impact on step-parent 
or blended families. In some instances, the young person either did 
not get along with the step-parent and/or had never lived with the step-parent. 
Expecting them to financially support the young person was seen as unfair 
and exacerbating existing family conflict.Â   
Â  
   5   From 1 October 1999, Family 
Allowance was extended to eligible families with older dependent children 
aged 18-20 years and students aged 21-24 years who are ineligible for 
Youth Allowance. From 1 July 2000, Family Allowance has been replaced 
by Family Tax Benefit Part A. The October 1999 changes to Family Allowance 
now apply to Family Tax Benefit Part A.Â
