TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   SYDNEY



Subjects: Christmas Island tragedy; Labor’s mining tax

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to say that what happened at Christmas Island last week is just a terrible, terrible tragedy. It was  an unspeakable horror which has shocked everyone who has witnessed it. We grieve for the victims and we  feel for everyone who has been traumatised by this disaster. The sad truth is that as long as the people  smuggling trade exists, as long as the boats keep coming, the risk of disaster remains and that’s why it is  important that we put policies in place as quickly as humanly possible that do offer the prospect of stopping  the boats.

Now, it’s absolutely urgent that we put policies in place that deny the people smugglers a product to sell.  The Coalition for many months now has been urging the Government to adopt policies which have been  proven to work. They worked in the past and there’s no reason why they can’t work again in the future.  Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, I want to say that we stand ready to work constructively with the  Government but we’ve got to work towards policies that will actually stop the boats - the policies that we’ve  been talking about for many months now. I do want to work constructively with the Government but it’s got  to be towards policies that work, policies that will stop the boats; the sorts of policies that we’ve been  talking about now for many months.

Finally, I want to say that the Coalition is grateful to the Government for the cooperation we’ve received  over the last few days in receiving briefings. We’ve received briefings under the ordinary procedures for  giving briefings to the Opposition. I’m happy for this process to continue. I don’t think we need any new  processes and that’s why today I’ve written to the Prime Minister politely declining her suggestion of the  establishment of a new committee. There’s no reason why we can’t just continue with the well-established,  existing orthodox practices here.

Finally, I just want to say thanks to Scott Morrison for being with me this morning. I think that Scott has  done a really outstanding job as the Opposition shadow minister in this area, particularly under the pressure  of the last few days.

There is one other subject I would like to just say a few words on before throwing to questions and that’s the  mining tax, if I may. Plainly, this is yet another example of a Government that can’t be trusted and a  Government that can’t be trusted to deliver. I think it’s another case of the Prime Minister saying one thing

before the election and doing something quite different after the election. So I can understand first why the  big mining companies feel dudded and, second, why there’s considerable resentment inside the Gillard  Cabinet at the way this matter has been handled by the Treasurer and by the Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

Can you just spell out exactly what policy you would like to put in place?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Coalition has been saying for months now that in order to deny the people smugglers a product to  sell we have to first reintroduce temporary protection visas. Second we have to have a policy of rigorous  offshore processing, including [inaudible]. We have to work as closely as is humanly possible with source  and transit countries. Finally, we do need to retain the capacity, where it is safe to do so, to turn boats  around. Now, I want to stress that it has to be safe and there’ll be very many instances where it wouldn’t be,  but we can’t surrender that capacity.

QUESTION:

So that means closing Christmas Island? The detention centre?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not suggesting that. What I am saying is that we have a perfectly good detention centre that was built by  Australian tax payers at Nauru and rather than open more and more detention centres on the mainland as the  Government is now doing we should reopen the centre at Nauru. The Nauruans would be happy for that to  happen. They believe it can be reopened in a matter of weeks. That would send the strongest possible signal  to the people smugglers that things have changed.

QUESTION:

But how would that stop what happened this week, because people would still head to Christmas Island,  would they not?

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s no one change that will of itself stop the boats from coming, but there is a range of policies that have  been proven to work and we need to go back to the policies that did work in the past. We stopped the boats  before. We can stop the boats again if we put the right policies in place.

QUESTION:

Would your policy have stopped what happened this week?

TONY ABBOTT:

You’ve got to understand that in the last five years of the Howard Government’s life, we had three boats a  year, not three boats a week. In the last five years of the Howard Government’s life, we had something like  180 asylum seekers arrive. Now, obviously there is far less capacity for tragedy if there are far fewer boats  and far fewer people coming in them.

QUESTION:

Would the Coalition commit to more [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

The important thing, the absolutely critical thing is to put in place policies that deny the people smugglers a  product to sell. That’s the key to it - changing the policy so that the people smugglers no longer have a  product to sell. Now, if we can do that we then start to stop the boats and that’s what we need.

QUESTION:

Will you be going to Christmas Island?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve visited a number of detention centres. Most recently, I visited the detention centre at Curtin Air  Base in Western Australia. I’ve now paid two visits to our naval personnel in Darwin, who are manning our  border protection patrols and I will in the course of my normal activities as Opposition Leader continue  those kinds of visits.

QUESTION:

Is Labor backtracking on the mining tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think they are on the horns of a dilemma. They clearly made commitments to the big miners before the  election to get them to pull their ads, the ads that brought down a prime minister and threatened to bring  down a government. They were desperate to stop the ads and they made the promises that they felt they  needed to make to stop the ads. Now, of course, they’re desperate for the revenue and that’s why they are  breaking their promises.

Thank you.
