Curtin Detention Centre no place for children

The government’s plan to send children to the Curtin Detention Centre is unacceptable, the  Australian Greens said today.

“We know that children shouldn’t be in detention but remote, isolated detention centres are the last  place they should be sent,” the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.

“The Curtin Detention Centre was shut down because it is not an acceptable environment to house  refugees and now this government is planning on sending children there.

“Curtin was so disastrous that the Howard Government shut it down and when the Labor  Government reopened it we were promised families and children would not be sent there.

“The current plan to lock children up in the Curtin Detention Centre shows that Labor can’t be  trusted to look after and care for refugees.

“One child in detention is too many, but 1000 children behind bars in Australian detention centres is  an absolute disgrace.”
