PRESS RELEASE

TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE BY DR JOHN HEWSON MP  SHADOW TREASURER. TUESDAY 18 JULY 1989

JH: Today's balance of payments data, which give us the final data for the year to June 1989 confirms that  interest rates will stay high and that the jobs of  many Australians are now on the line. The current

account deficit for June of $1,632 billion is yet  another monthly record and brings the total for the  year to 17.7 billion which is about an 87 per cent  forecasting error on the estimate of $9.5 billion

for the year.

The thing that disturbs me most about it is that  over the last twelve to eighteen months this  deterioration has occurred at a time when world  growth has still been quite strong and when

commodity prices have generally been favourable to  Australia.

Neither of these two things can be counted on to  continue and in those terms Keating's luck has run  out. I fear the worst is yet to come. His failure  to acknowledge this problem has put us in a

situation where many Australians are now of course  living with very high interest rates and you can't  rule out the possibility that interest rates will  go higher. But to persist with what has been an

increase in Government expenditure, tax cuts and  with his wage policy at the present time, puts at  risk jobs. It raises the possibility that  unemployment will increase in the course of the

next 12 months under this Government's policy.

In our view the Government really has to stop and  take stock. It has to admit the errors of its  ways, that it has no anti-inflationary policy, that  it has no effective policy for dealing with the  balance of payments and it has to do three things.

One, it has to bring in a tough budget in August  based on cuts in Government expenditure. Secondly  I think it should rethink its current position on  wages to continue to increase across-the-board  wage increases unrelated to productivity, on top of

tax cuts and increases in Government expenditure is

a prescription for rising unemployment in the  course of the next 12 months. And finally, and I  think most importantly as a matter of urgency,

start on the process of genuine micro reform. That  is removing all the supply side impediments that  have been identified that stop us improving our  productive capacity and stop us really developing  the export potential we need in order to do the

job.

How long will it take ... (inaudible) ...

There's no short term easy solutions. It will call  for sustained policies over a period of years.

How many years?

I'm not going to put a number of years on it but  it's a medium term objective. You can get some  short term beneficial effects but it is a policy  strategy that has to be sustained over a period of  years.

So you object entirely to the Treasurer's  suggestion yesterday that low interest rates for  the next six months is a possibility?

I think you should ask the Treasurer by asking  what's his forecast for the current account deficit  next year. If it's still let's say $16 billion or  more for the year as a whole then it's very hard to

see how interest rates can come down very much from  the level that they're presently at.

What's your forecast?

I haven't made a detailed forecast yet but I think  the numbers will go higher before they come down in  terms of the fact that we have several months yet  of, I think, continuing adverse numbers of the  order of magnitude that we've seen. Somewhere

around $1.5 billion.

Do you expect that the economy has turned around?

No I don't think you can conclude that at all. I  think that there are some indications that suggest  of course that activity may be slowing and some of  the housing data starts and finance are an element  of that. I think that some of the sentiment

surveys are examples of that but we still have very  strong import growth, we still have very strong  credit growth, we still have very strong investment  growth and anticipation start is still very strong,

Q:

Q:

JH:

the best you can say is that it's mixed. I think  the most worrying statistic for the government in  recent days was the June employment data the other  day which showed that right through to the month of  June the economy was still bubbling along with  trend employment growth still up and trend  unemployment rate still down.

... (inaudible) ... the tight monetary policy is  not necessary in view of the balance of payments  and that it could even be counter-productive?

Well we've argued for some time that we think it is  counter-productive and the most obvious example of  that is the fact that over the last 15 months -  well let's say from March/April of last year until

early this year - there was a substantial increase  in interest rates which significantly appreciated  the exchange rate. I think our currency went up  about 25 per cent over that period on a trade  weighted basis and that has lowered import prices

and import prices in the year to March fell by  13.5% so that if you had an import problem as we  did flowing from strong activity you compounded  that problem by lowering import prices so  dramatically over that period. So it's totally  counter-productive.

So what's the answer then?

Take the weight off monetary policy, put it on  fiscal policy, put it on micro reform ...

Does that mean interest rates could come down?

Interest rates will come down in a medium term  sense if you bring inflation down and you keep it  down.

... (inaudible) ...

That's for the Government to say. We have  identified the fact that we found well in excess of  a billion and we are still reviewing the whole  expenditure area and we will announce our details

in due course.

So you are saying that ... (inaudible) ...

No, I'm saying that we've identified well in excess  of a billion and we are still reviewing expenditure  and it's a combination of what other things the  Government does. This Government is not prepared,

or it can't because it's a captive of the ACTU and  the left-wing of its party and it can't take any of  those micro reform decisions and it has to put even  more weight on fiscal policy.

How many points would come off interest rates if  you had a $2 billion cut in the rate of ...

(inaudible) ...

I don't know. You could get some favourable short  term reaction but you've got to sustain that policy  over a period of years, you've got to ...

... (inaudible) ...

Senator Stone was echoing a conclusion of an EPAC  study some time ago as I recall that study although  I haven't checked it and that was that one of the  factors that have led to a lower savings rate or  has discouraged savings in Australia has been the  growth in the welfare system. There are a lot of  other factors including importantly the tax system  which discourages savings.

But if you adopt that conclusion wouldn't that mean  very clear cut backs to welfare ... (inaudible) ...

You're drawing those conclusions. We have said  what we said on the record about welfare. That is  that it can and should be targeted better and you  shouldn't draw any other conclusion from what

Senator Stone's said or Mr Peacock said yesterday  or what I said.

... (inaudible) .  .  .

Well I think it's one of the main factors.

Just what did you say could be achieved as a result  of cutting welfare?

We will cut a range of expenditure to get that and  we are reviewing all expenditure. In due course  we will give you the detail.

You agree with Senator Stone that State schools are  a part of the welfare system?

I'm not going to enter into the detail of the  debate of what Senator Stone said and included and  didn't include. But I will say that all areas of  expenditure are being reviewed.

5 .

Q:

JH:

Q:

JH:

Q:

JH:

Q:

What policy conclusions should be drawn from ...  (inaudible) ...

I think that you need to review the area of welfare  spending as we're doing. You need to seek to make  savings in that area and I think importantly you  need to target it such that those who are as I

said in genuine need really are treated as they  should be.

... (inaudible) ...

Well it has been proposed by many luminaries  including the President of our party. We looked at  it a year or so ago and decided against a broad  based consumption tax in our first term in

government.  I think the question that needs to be  asked to the Government is how is it that they've  achieved such a substantial increase in say one of  the major consumption taxes - wholesale sales tax -  over the life of their government, 170% increase in

six years, 3 times the rate of inflation. They've  already hit average Australian households pretty  hard off a very limited base of that consumption  tax and it's a very inequitable and inefficient and  anomalous sort of way to go about raising such a  very large amount of revenue. It's about 10% now  of government revenue.

... (inaudible) ... on political grounds rather  than economic grounds though isn't it?

No we decided on the basis of a number of  considerations and the point that I put a number of  times about consumption taxes is that there's still  more argument to be refined in relation to

consumption taxes then the claimed impacts on  savings and consumption. If you look around the  world countries that have adopted a consumption tax  haven't necessarily and in most cases I don't think

have at all got the savings benefits that have been  advocated. New Zealand is a good example because  it was used as a way of sustaining government  expenditure rather than creating genuine savings.   But I think that there is still onus of proof on  those who advocate a consumption tax to refine  their argument.  From our point of view, we've said  we're not going to have a new broad based

consumption tax in our first term in government.

When you say that there's a need for tightening in  welfare that must mean more assets test or income  tests?

JH:

No it doesn't necessarily mean that.

How else can you tighten it?

Well when we announce the detail you'll say "yes  yes that's right that's exactly how you can target  and that's how it's done".

... (inaudible) ...

I mean that's a possibility but I'm not saying that  it is or isn't what we're doing. We're not saying  any detail until we announce it. The Government's  bringing down the budget on August 15 I think the  pressure ought to be on them now to go in and cut  expenditure or live with the consequences of their

failed strategy.

... (inaudible) ...

We would rather see the Government address  attention to solving the problem and the very real  problems of high interest rates and rising  inflation and debt are the problems to be  addressed, not gimmicks and not short term power  kicks. I think they ought to address the problem.

... (inaudible) ...

All I'd say is our view, as I understand it, is  that we are not looking at any short term cosmetic  solutions to the problem. We're going to deal with  the problems and we've consistently said that.

How soon after the Budget will you be releasing  your policy?

When we think it's strategically the time to do it.

But it doesn't take any comfort from the fact that  ... (inaudible) ...

I'm sure they will and any turn around that's  sustained would be welcomed. There's no doubt  about that.  I think that if you look at the  monthly numbers the pick up in exports and the fall

in imports is encouraging but it's one month on the  top of what is a very large problem.  I'd like to  see that sustained for some months to come. But I  was also concerned, I mean there are negatives in

the figures as well for this particular month and  that is that the net income deficit has really  significantly moved against us reflecting the fact  that our interest on external debt is becoming a

7 .

Q:

JH:

Q:

JH:

Q:

JH:

major problem. So with ... (inaudible) ... there's  good and bad news in the particular monthly number.  The key point though is that you can rationalise  one monthly number and another and another as the  Treasurer has done and miss the main game - it slid  right out from under him. The outcome has been

$17.7 billion current account deficit against a  forecast of 9.5.

Doesn't there need to be ... (inaudible) ...

Well I don't think those enquiries get them out of  the political environment. My personal view is  that there's enough work around on savings for  Government's to make the decision about that. I  mean I have fears like I have about the third

runway at Sydney airport. We'll have yet another  enquiry on some other ground and the job will never  get done and the thing will go into a bolt before  we actually deal with it. I think that's the big  problem with looking at savings it doesn't  depoliticise it. Financial sector deregulation was  supposed to depoliticise interest rates and the  government has politicised it beyond belief.

... (inaudible) ...

We are not smug. We are quite happy and we will be  quite happy to put down the detail and debate the  detail.

... (inaudible) ...

That isn't true and the point that I put to you is  that the Government puts a lot of weight on the  particular details of tax and expenditure. The  principles of our tax package are out there and in

some detail and a lot more detail I'd suggest than  some of the detail we know about their fiscal  policy and some of the principles of our  expenditure policy are there. But that's the small  part of the policy adjustment task. The big issue,  and the real fabric in Keating's terms, is all that  micro reform that is to remove supply-side

impediments that stop us growing faster or being  able to grow or produce faster or produce more and  of course to stimulate exports. If you look at  this data for the last year we've had about a $5  billion, a bit over a $5 billion deterioration in  the current account deficit between 87/88 and

88/89. $4 billion or four fifths of that has been in the trade account and its a staggering  deterioration over a short period of time to what  has been a very favourable international climate of

Q:

strong world growth and pretty good commodity  prices.  To turn that around in a trading sense and  generate a sustained trade surpluses for a period  of years, something we're not used to seeing in  this country is going to take a major effort on the  micro side dealing with all those impediments and

they are much more important than a few details of  a tax and expenditure package.

Mr Hewson you're talking about spending, you're  talking about a budget ... (inaudible) ...

That's right. I think an element of the macro  adjustment task is to cut spending and take the  weight of interest rates but the medium term  solution to our balance of payments problems is all  micro is all supply side and you know the

government is busily trying to distract attention  from that fact. The reason is that it's the area  where they won't ever take any of those decisions  or they can't take them because the ACTU won't let

them.

... (inaudible) ...

There are no quick fix short term solutions. Clearly you start the macro policy adjustment sure  but we won't just have one year of cutting  expenditure and call it quits. We are looking at  a medium term strategy of riding back the size of  the public sector. So we are not going to ...

... (inaudible) ...

No we're not going back in terms of years. We're  going back to what we thing our desirable levels of  government relative to economic activity.

... (inaudible) ...

Well we'll specify some of the details of our  policy in a medium term sense.

Why should the public believe anything you say when  you're lecturing the government constantly about  what to do without providing anything?

I gave you a very specific 3 point plan as to what  they can do. They're in government. They can  bring down ...

It's very general.

9 .

JH: It's not very general. It's quite specific isn't  it. I'd say it's quite specific. Look, in  government they have the responsibility to do it.  Keating has been sitting here for 12 or 15 months  ducking and weaving on the issue, saying it's due

to this special fact or that special fact and this  will reverse and the baby's gone out with the bath  water. The whole issue has slid out of his control X and now we are what 4 or 5 weeks away from the

budget and we have evidence of a massive policy  failure on his part and you put the pressure on him  as to what he's going to do in August.

Q: ... (inaudible) ...

JH: We can identify in broad terms which we will.

Q; Why don't you say it now?

JH: Because I'm not here today to announce details of  our policy strategy. You've got the bulk of the  principles of our detail.

Q: Dr Hewson will we have it this year?

JH: I'm not putting a date on it one way or the other.

Q: So it may not be this year.

JH: I'm not putting a date and you shouldn't conclude  that. You shouldn't conclude that it will be this  year, next year, it will come out when we think  it's strategically desirable to bring it out.

Q: After the next election campaign?

JH: Perhaps some of you would like to think that. But  you'll see. We'll be prepared to get it out and  debate it on the record for a reasonable period of  time before the next election campaign.

Qs So we will have the details ...

JH: There's plenty of reasons why you would also wait  to the budget right.  The Government has got  fictitious forward estimates out there. The  Government has got absolutely fictitious forecasts  and they're going to make another round of  presumably there going to have another look at  expenditure. We hear that rumour.  Why not get all  that additional information before we release the

final detail of policy. It's only common sense I'd  suggest to you rather than it being what you're  suggesting.

10 .

Q:

JH:

Q:

JH:

Just on earlier remarks, I've had a weekly release  policy detail no matter when the election is can  you hold out any hope for Australia ... (inaudible)

We can hold out the hope of much better economic  management and we can hold out the hope that we  will increase living standards in a sustainable  way. We won't be delivering short sharp boosts in

a fictitious sense like a tax cut on July 1 and an  interest rate increase on July 2 as we basically  saw in the last few months.  We want sustainable  increases in living standards not political games,   not vote buying exercises.  It is a major economic  problem. It is a bigger problem as we've had in  the post war period and you listen to the  Government spokesman including Keating yesterday  you would have no idea. He wants his monetary  policy to work and he's out there telling everyone

interest rates increases are about to peak that the  problems are solved. Don't worry be happy it's all  in the pipeline sort of nonsense. That's not going  to get us through. In fact it is one of the main  reasons why we are now sitting at 15 months after  he started tightening monetary policy with record

interest rate levels and people like the gentleman  down the front asking do you think the economy's  peaked. It's staggering that after 15 months  there's still an active debate as to whether the

interest rates are going to work at all.

How early can this sustainable improvement be ...

We're not in the business of making electoral  promises in those terms. We are there to do a job.  We are not there to buy your vote and to a large  extent the sort of decisions that we want to take  we think are for the benefit of the country. They

are not designed to win votes.  We are in tough  times we are in very serious times and my opening  comment was that high interest rates are there and  they're there for some time but the real risk now

is that unemployment will go up that jobs are on  the line. That's the real risk in the Government  continuing to let the situation drift and to  continue with their wages policy in circumstances  where they've just increased government expenditure

they've just given a tax cut and they're going to  stay with an across-the-board wage increase that's  unrelated to productivity. It's a prescription for  rising unemployment. In the course of the next 12  months average Australians are going to have to

live with high interest rates and the prospect of  rising unemployment. .

11 .

Q:

JH:

Q:

JH:

... (inaudible) ...

It's not for me to say how big the expenditure cuts  will be. You'd have to know what else they're  going to do. What else they're going to do in the  micro reform area. What else they're going to do

in other parts of fiscal policy. How many gimmicks  they're going to come in with in terms of trying to  cushion the impact of their high interest rates  rather than deal with the problem. Ask Keating  those questions in a few minutes time and he should  be full bobble on it. He must be half way through

the process.

... (inaudible) ...

We want to get interest rates down in the medium  term. There will be some short term favourable  effects. A quick move to a tighter fiscal policy  and a substantially larger budget surplus and so  on. But, you've got to sustain that process over  time to get the benefits. If you start to take

some of the other decisions in the wage area, the  labour market reform area, in the micro area you  quicken the pace with which you can get interest  rates down and keep them down. That's all we're

saying. We don't in that context hold out any  specific promises about interest rates in any  period of time. I reckon it's totally  irresponsible of the Treasurer to do what he did  yesterday, to do what he did yesterday to come out

and say well interest rates could come down within  six months without having delivered the policy  package to make that the case. On the basis of the  last 15 months you couldn't believe him, he's only  put them up one after another.
