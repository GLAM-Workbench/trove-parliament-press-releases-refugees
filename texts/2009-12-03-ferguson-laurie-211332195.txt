Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services



Opening of the Parliament of the World's Religions

3 December 2009, Melbourne Convention and Exhibition  Centre, Melbourne

On behalf of the Australian Government I would like to welcome you all here tonight.

I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we  are gathered today and acknowledge the continuing challenges faced by Australia's  Indigenous people and our responsibility in overcoming their deprivation.

In fact, Australia’s Indigenous peoples are custodians of some of the oldest cultural  and religious traditions in the world.

Australia seems an entirely appropriate place to hold this meeting. It is a country that  has been forged by a meeting of cultures and faiths.

Since the end of the Second World War, successive Australian Governments have  maintained persistent migration programs.

To date, the Australian Government has helped about seven million people to settle  permanently, including a refugee component of approximately 700 000 people. That  migration stream has been extremely diverse, which is a significant strength.

Migration has made us the multicultural, multilingual and multi-faith society we are  today.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), there are now approximately  22 million Australians, speaking more than 260 languages, including indigenous  languages, and identifying with more than 270 ancestries.

In the 2006 Census, some 14 million Australians identified with a faith - for some 13  million people, this was Christianity.

However, our nation is also home to more than:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 400 000 Buddhists  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 340 000 followers of Islam   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 150 000 Hindu   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 90 000 Jews  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 26 000 Sikhs   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 12 000 people of the Baha'i faith.

Equally significantly, were more than 3.7 million Australians who did not identify with  a faith.

Australia's approach - of acknowledging and utilising the diversity of our cultures as  a strength of our society - was influential in the decision of the Council of the  Parliament of the World's Religions to hold this event here.

One of our great successes is that our multicultural society compares well with other  countries in terms of low levels of discrimination, social tension or disharmony.

Events such as this can build bridges of understanding and respect not only within  our country but across the world.

I would like to echo the views of William E Lesher, Chair of the Board of Trustees of  the Council for a Parliament of the World’s Religions, when he said in a recent  interview that most of all, he hoped that this fifth Parliament of the World’s Religions  captures the imaginations of people the world over and that religion will be seen -  not as the problem - but as a vital part of the solution to the world’s ills.

Thank you and again, on behalf of the Australian welcome to Melbourne and to  Australia.
