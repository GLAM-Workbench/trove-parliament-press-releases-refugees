IMMIGRATION MINISTER REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR AUSTRALIA'S  REFUGEE DETERMINATION PROCESS

The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, today reaffirmed his support for  Australia's refugee determination procedures.

Mr Hand's comments followed the announcement today that 10  Chinese people had completed the process of refugee  determination and had been formally rejected as refugees.

"The failed asylum-seekers were from one of the most  recently arrived boats and the speedy resolution of their  claims' shows that the new fast-tracking system is working  well.

"Rejected asylum-seekers have no claim to remain in  Australia and I put people on notice that threats,  demonstrations and other dramatic action will not alter the  situation. I repeat again, I will not intervene in the  process," Mr Hand said.

The Minister noted that a Cambodian man, who arrived on an  earlier boat, had met the UNHCR criteria for refugee status  and was granted refuge, while a family of nine from Cambodia  withdrew their applications for refugee status and have  returned home.
