HILLÂ· APPLAUDS WORK OF UNHCR. OPTI.TNKS CHAT.T.ENGES IT WILL FACE

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill,  today applauded the work of the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and outlined some of the  challenges the body could expect to face in coming years.

Senator Hill made his comments at a ceremony in Canberra to mark  the 40th anniversary of the founding of the UNHCR.

He said the need for the UNHCR was unlikely to diminish, and that  it would face many more challenges, possibly including the mass  movement of populations from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  to the West.

Senator Hill said questions surrounding the definition of  refugees and the circumstances in which such people were entitled  to UNHCR help had led some states to become more restrictive.

"It is obviously a matter the international community must  resolve," Senator Hill said.

He said the UNHCR would be increasingly required to take on new  roles, as was demonstrated in the Gulf with the Kurds.

"More effort needs to be devoted to ensuring that the mandate for  the UNHCR is clear and relevant to current international

conditions, and that states understand their obligations in these  circumstances," Senator Hill said.

He said the activities of the UNHCR were being curtailed by the  unpredictable nature of its funding, and it was hoped the current  evaluation of the UNHCR would provide a solution to this problem.

Senator Hill said more international attention needed to be  devoted to areas which had the potential to alleviate the refugee  problem.

These areas included the need to avert new flows of refugees by  identifying and preventing conditions likely to create refugee  problems, and the establishment of conditions in home states  which would allow refugees to voluntarily return.
