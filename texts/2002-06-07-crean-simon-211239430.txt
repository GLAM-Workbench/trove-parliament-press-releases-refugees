STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

Further Excision of Australian Territory

Australian citizens, and the islands on which they live, have today been excised from Australia’s migration zone with the stroke of a pen.

The Government has been clearly planning this move for some time as evidenced by its anti-asylum seeker rhetoric in Question Time.

Given this, and the Government’s record of dishonesty on asylum seeker issues, it is reasonable to ask is this a legitimate policy move or a political trick to breathe new life into this issue.

Despite having the time to properly consult, the Government has taken no steps to consult with the communities affected by its decision.

Most of the people affected by this decision are Indigenous Australians, yet Mr Ruddock, who is also Minister for Indigenous Affairs, has shown his complete disregard for the views of these island communities.

The Government also had ample time to seek the views of the Opposition about this major step, but failed to do so.

I have today written to the Prime Minister seeking a comprehensive briefing from all relevant agencies on the intelligence which prompted today’s decision.

I will be demanding answers to the following questions:

1. When, and on what grounds, did the Government determine to take this step? 2. What will be the next excision - Fraser Island? King Island? Rottnest Island? Tasmania? 3. Why won’t this measure simply encourage people smugglers to travel

the extra few kilometres to the Australian mainland?

Without satisfactory answers to all of these questions, it is my strong inclination to recommend to the Labor Caucus that the Parliament should use its authority to disallow this measure.
