MEDIA RELEASE

THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER





A SHAMELESS CON



This Budget confirms that Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan are addicted to spending and allergic to tough  decisions.

This is another big taxing, big spending Labor Budget with no serious reform.

The Budget assumes less smoking with higher tobacco taxes, yet it assumes more investment with massively  higher mining taxes.

Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan are asking the Australian people to trust them to deliver a Budget outcome  that is based on the most favourable terms of trade in 60 years, assumes a significant increase in investment  in resources and assumes no new additional Government expenditure between now and 2014.

The BudgetÃ¢ÂÂs return to surplus relies upon a great big new tax on AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs resources sector, not tough  decisions.

This great big new mining tax is a dagger to the heart of the Australian economy, putting major projects at  risk and sending jobs offshore.

Mr Rudd and Mr Swan want to sacrifice AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs future economic prosperity to improve the numbers in  this BudgetÃ¢ÂÂs bottom line.

Spending in this Budget will increase by $26 billion over the next three years relative to last yearÃ¢ÂÂs record  spending forecast.

The Government will have to borrow over $700 million a week to fund its reckless and wasteful spending -  putting upward pressure on interest rates and the cost of living for Australian families.

Interest on net government debt will be $4.6 billion in 2010/11.

By 2012/13 the Government will be spending $6.5 billion a year on interest payments.   The peak debt bill of $93.7 billion will be the amount owed by the Australian people to pay for Kevin  RuddÃ¢ÂÂs spending spree.

The Government has not taken a single tough decision to rein in its reckless and wasteful spending. The  improvement in the BudgetÃ¢ÂÂs fiscal position is a direct result of a growing economy and stronger terms of  trade combined with tax hikes on miners and cigarettes and an attack on private health insurance.

The Budget also exposes the costs of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs waste, mismanagement and policy failures,  including a $1 billion blowout as a result of Kevin Rudd weakening AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs borders and $1 billion being  spent to fix LaborÃ¢ÂÂs tragic home insulation mess.

TAX:

The GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs $9 billion a year mining tax will damage the sector of the Australian economy which did  the most to see us through the Global Financial Crisis. Already this reckless decision has resulted in BHP  casting doubt over the $20 billion expansion of Olympic Dam, Santos deferring a decision on a $15 billion  LNG export-terminal in Gladstone, Xstrata suspending a $30 million regional exploration programme, and  Origin Energy predicting increases in domestic energy and fuel prices.

Small business across Australia will be deeply concerned by the additional $445 million that Mr Rudd and  Mr Swan will be giving to the Australian Taxation Office for increased compliance.

BILLION DOLLAR BOAT BLOWOUT:

LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Budget reveals the economic cost of Kevin Rudd losing control of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs borders.

Offshore asylum seeker management has blown-out by a massive $777 million since last yearÃ¢ÂÂs Budget.  This blow-out in offshore management costs has occurred at the same time as Kevin Rudd has walked away  from his commitment to universal offshore processing. Labor will spend an additional $202 million on  accommodation for illegal arrivals both on Christmas Island and on the Australian mainland in Darwin,  Sydney and Port Augusta.

HOME INSULATION PROGRAMME:

The Budget confirms that Kevin RuddÃ¢ÂÂs home insulation disaster will cost at least $1 billion to fix, with  thousands of homes across Australia still not inspected in the aftermath of the schemeÃ¢ÂÂs cancellation. The  Home Insulation programme which has been linked to four deaths and resulted in 240,000 dangerous and  dodgy insulation jobs, 1,000 electrified roofs, and 120 house fires, will now cost the Budget a further $1  billion. This programme is the most monumental failure of government policy in living memory.

LABOR SPIN ON SKILLS, EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT:

By setting a target for full employment at an unemployment rate of 4.75 per cent in 2012, the Government is  effectively giving up on the employment prospects of 75,000 Australians.

The GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs promise of a $661 million for skills investment re-badges $601 million of existing  spending, including a $456 million cut in the Productivity Places Programme.

Further delays in the Julia Gillard school halls programme will mean that $500 million of stimulus funding  will not be spent until 2011/12, at least three years after the Global Financial Crisis.

HEALTH:

The Budget confirms that Kevin RuddÃ¢ÂÂs health policies will be about more bureaucrats and not better  services. The Government will spend around $500 million to establish new layers of Commonwealth  bureaucracy. In less than a month, Kevin Rudd has broken his promise of no net increase in health  bureaucrats.

Having broken his election promise and built just two of 36 GP super clinics, Kevin Rudd is now asking the  Australian people to trust him to build 23 more. On this conversion rate, Australians can expect this latest  promise from Kevin Rudd to deliver just 1.4 extra super clinics.

Furthermore, what the Government isnÃ¢ÂÂt telling people is that only 9 of the additional 23 super clinics will  be at full scale.

ENVIRONMENT:

Having shelved its response to what Kevin Rudd described as “the greatest moral challenge of our time”, the  Budget demonstrates that the Government does not have a credible policy on climate change. The Coalition  remains the only major party with a policy that will reduce carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020 while  at the same time delivering good environmental outcomes.

But the Budget confirms that Kevin RuddÃ¢ÂÂs original great big new tax on everything - the ETS - will be  coming back after the election.

MORE WASTE AND GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING:

In an undisguised election campaign strategy, the Government will spend $126 million on print, radio and  television advertising.

Despite having no climate change policy, the Government will spend $30 million for another climate change  advertising campaign.

The Government will also spend $38.5 million over two years to advertise the outcomes of the Henry Tax  Review even though they only adopted a handful of the ReviewÃ¢ÂÂs 138 recommendations.

Despite having not even introduced their Paid Parental Leave (PPL) legislation into the Parliament, for the  second Budget year running, the Government has committed funding for PPL advertising to a new total of  $12 million.

The Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs daily PR spin on hospitals will continue with a new $29.5 million advertising  campaign to sell their health package even though Western Australia has not signed on and all new beds  wonÃ¢ÂÂt even be delivered until 2013-14.

With broadband services under the NBN still years away, the Rudd Government has committed $16 million  over two years, including $7.6 million in the current financial year, on an NBN advertising campaign while  at the same time, cutting $16.4 million from the previous Coalition GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂAustralian Broadband  GuaranteeÃ¢ÂÂ programme which ensured fast and affordable broadband.

It would appear that politically motivated government advertising is more important to Kevin Rudd than the  $21.2 million programme to combat illicit drugs, from which he has cut $4 million.

DEFENCE

Wayne SwanÃ¢ÂÂs Budget delivers Kevin RuddÃ¢ÂÂs priorities to Defence - more bureaucrats and less to the front  line, increasing civilian numbers by 1,500 and cutting the number of uniform personnel by 500. The Budget  will also place greater pressure on recruitment and retention in the ADF with further cuts to the successful  defence gap year programme.

INFRASTRUCTURE:

The Budget does not invest a single additional dollar in AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs major road networks. There is no  additional funding for the duplication of the Pacific Highway, making a farce of Kevin RuddÃ¢ÂÂs commitment  to finish the duplication by 2016 - another broken promise.  11 May 2010
