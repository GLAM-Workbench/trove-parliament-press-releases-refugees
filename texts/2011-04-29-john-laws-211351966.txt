29 April 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS,  RADIO 2SM, SYDNEY AND SUPER RADIO NETWORK

Subjects: Border protection; a new intervention.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

JOHN LAWS:

Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, John.

JOHN LAWS:

Why are we putting up with this nonsense?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s a very good question. I mean, we’re being played for mugs and I think that we really do have to  say look, this is our country and these are our rules and people who defy the rules are dealt with. I think that  those protestors should be brought down off the roof as quickly and as, well I think it should be done firmly.  Obviously, you don’t want anyone to get hurt if possible but one way or another they should come down off  the roof.

JOHN LAWS:

Even if they do get hurt?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, you know, if you or I were obstructing, if we were in breach of the peace, John, the police would  deal with us and they would try not to hurt us but if we resisted they would apply just that amount of force  that was necessary to ensure that we weren’t doing the wrong thing anymore and that’s just the way the  police operate.

JOHN LAWS:

What about this silly little girl, Emma, who’s on the roof of Chris Bowen’s office, what about her? I mean,  she said she’s 25, she sounds like she’s about 15, I have no idea. She’s sitting up there on the roof in some  sort of support of these people who are illegal immigrants. So, she’s supporting people breaching the law.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well John, you’re right. It’s a bit of a silly stunt and I think that all of these people should be brought town  from the roof because they’re a public nuisance, to put it at its mildest, they’re a public nuisance and people  shouldn’t be able to play us for mugs and that’s what’s happening.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah and it’s happening here in the great city of Sydney too with people like Emma climbing up on to roofs  and behaving like stupid children. What is happening at the Immigration Department? Why are they taking  such a soft approach? Can you understand why the Minister, he seems to be almost mute on the subject. I  think he’s terrified.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think he’s overwhelmed. I mean, this is basically a problem which has paralysed the Government  and we’ve now got a situation where the final nail in the coffin has been delivered to the East Timor solution  and what can the Government do? Well, what it should do is it should pick up the phone immediately to the  President of Nauru and say, look, let’s reopen the centre there but because the Government is terrified of  looking like it’s belatedly endorsing the policies of its predecessor I don’t think that’s going to happen but if  the Government had any guts or spine, that’s what it would do. It would pick up the phone to the President  of Nauru, it would accept that this whole East Timor thing had always been just a bit of political spin, it  would pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and that would send a very strong signal to the people  smugglers that Australia’s serious.

JOHN LAWS:

I’ve spoken to many, many, many ordinary Australians and they are absolutely fed up with what’s going on  at Villawood and Christmas Island. Is this protest making Australians less sympathetic to asylum seekers  and refugees? `Cause I think it is.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there’s no doubt that on Christmas Island, where I was earlier in the week, the rioting there has very  much alienated the islanders. I mean, I think the islanders, like Australians generally, are not without  sympathy for desperate people…

JOHN LAWS:

No, no.

TONY ABBOTT:

Although even desperate people should obey the law but when people who’ve come to our country illegally  act illegally in our country, when they assault officers of the Australian Government, when they destroy  Australian taxpayer property, I think people think that that puts them beyond the pale and that people like

that shouldn’t be given temporary protection visas as the Government is promising, they should be put in  detention and deported as soon as they possibly can be.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah, well I think that the majority of Australians would certainly agree with that but tell me, if you were  Prime Minister - and it probably won’t be too long before you are - but if you were Prime Minister what  would you be doing about this people and that kind of behaviour?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well John, you can’t allow people to defy the legitimate authority of the country and these people who have  been up on the roofs now for quite a few days simply need to be brought down. Now, it should be done as  gently as possible but nevertheless they should be brought down. They just should be brought down. It’s as  simple as that. You can’t have people in chronic defiance of legitimate authority and that’s what we’ve got  here.

JOHN LAWS:

You are still, I presume, in Alice Springs?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am. I’m at the Braitling Public School in Alice Springs, a lovely school, about 60 per cent of the enrolment  is indigenous. I’ve just been to an ANZAC Day ceremony and it’s been very beautifully done and I’m about  to hand out some Aussie Rules balls which the Richmond Club has donated because Richmond has quite a  relationship with the Aussie Rules players of Alice Springs and the kids are excited and they’re waiting to  see my inadequate skills as an Aussie Rules player.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah I’ve been keeping an eye on that, don’t worry.

TONY ABBOTT:

My hand-balling is hopeless. I don’t even try to bounce the ball. It just becomes an embarrassment!

JOHN LAWS:

I wasn’t going to bring it up. Listen, just quickly before you go because I know you do have other things to  do, you’re talking with the Aboriginal people about alcohol and the intervention programme. Has anything  really worked to change that, the rivers of grog culture that has ruined so many, many Aboriginal  communities and wonderful Aboriginal lives?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes it has, John and I’ve spent a bit of time over the last couple of days with a magnificent woman called  Bess Price from the Yuendumu community.

JOHN LAWS:

I’ve heard about her, she’s terrific.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah she is and a very gusty woman who is not only a beautiful speaker of the national language but can  speak three to four Aboriginal languages as well and is fully versed in the law, the culture and the language  of traditional Aboriginals in Central Australia. A really magnificent woman. Now, she says  that the  intervention wasn’t perfect but yes, it does mean that the kids are safer, it has meant more food on the tables,  in some of the communities at least more kids are going to school. So, it has been a significant step in the  right direction.

Now, it’s worked reasonably well in most of the remote communities. Unfortunately some of the problems  have transferred to Alice Springs where grog is still readily available. It’s often being consumed illegally  and this is another situation where the police and rangers are often reluctant to enforce the law. I mean,  yesterday in broad daylight you had people drinking outside the council chambers and you’re just not  supposed to do it. Now, I don’t say that drinking outside the council chambers is a crime on the scale of  assault and battery but nevertheless it is an offence and it shouldn’t be allowed to happen.

JOHN LAWS:

No, well I can’t understand why the softly-softly approach is still being taken, why is it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, none of us want confrontation and I guess we are particularly reluctant to see confrontation with  Aboriginal people because we all have a sense of the injustices that have been done to them over the years  but in the end by tolerating this kind of thing we make everyone’s situation worse. We don’t help Aboriginal  people by conniving at this continuation of victimhood and this continuation of the welfare culture which so  many people are born into.

JOHN LAWS:

Very true.

Alright, Tony. Thanks again for your time. I’m sure you’re going to be terrific with the kids and they’re  terrific little kids too, aren’t they?

TONY ABBOTT:

They’re great kids and it’s a great sport and the terrific thing about sport is that it has been so good for so  many people to improve their situation.

JOHN LAWS:

Ok Tony, thanks for your time. Have a nice weekend.

TONY ABBOTT:

And you, John.
