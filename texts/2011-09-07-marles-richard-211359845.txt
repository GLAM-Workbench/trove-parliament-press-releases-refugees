ABC News 24 the World — Interview with  Jeremy Fernandez  Transcript, E&OE

JEREMY FERNANDEZ: Rising seas are one of the most pressing issues confronting low-lying nations in the Pacific and it's one of the headline items on the agenda for the Pacific  Islands Forum underway in Auckland. The region is united in its urgency for action but so far  it hasn't resulted in the sort of financial help many countries like Kiribati are calling for. I  spoke earlier to Australia's Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, Richard  Marles.

Richard Marles, thank you for joining us.

RICHARD MARLES: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here, Jeremy.

JEREMY FERNANDEZ: Many people who've been to Kiribati say you can talk about the  effects of climate change but when you've been to Kiribati it's quite different to see the ocean  encroaching on a community.

RICHARD MARLES: Look, that is absolutely true. A member of the UN Secretary-General's delegation travelling with us over the weekend put it very simply, and that is, that  seeing is believing.

When you go to Tarawa which is about 30 kilometres long, South Tarawa's about 30  kilometres long, but in some areas the width of the island is simply the width of the road and  just a few hundred metres at its widest.

The sense of crowdedness — there's 40,000 to 50,000 people living on this strip of land —  but the sense of vulnerability to the sea is overwhelming.

The sea, which has been a source of sustenance and security for centuries, is now seen as  something of a threat.

That creates enormous vulnerability for these communities and you're actually seeing the  physical effects of that now.

Storm surges mean salt water is coming into the fresh water table underneath the island and,  in a whole lot of wells along the island, the water is now undrinkable.

At high tides you see water in people's lounge rooms, you see soil erosion come to within a  few metres of the air strip.

So, the effects of climate change are very real. This is the place which is the front line in the  challenge of global climate change.

JEREMY FERNANDEZ: The UN has been heavily criticised by Pacific nations for the  complexity of the processes they need to go through to access those funds from the UN to get  money for adaptation and mitigation. Where do you think the breakdown is?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, in the UN's defence, and the UN Secretary-General made this  point today when he addressed the Pacific Islands Forum, a lot of the complexity lies in the  member countries, that is the donor countries' systems, in terms of bringing forth the money  they have said they'll provide.

From Australia's point of view, we do think there is an issue about getting the global funds  flowing.

We don't think they're flowing fast enough so to that end we agree with the Pacific island  countries.

We have to put our money where our mouth is in that regard and the amount we have  contributed. In terms of the fast track climate change adaptation program, we have now  committed more than 80 per cent. This is important in its own terms but we hope it represents  an example to the rest of the donor community because, as I say, this stuff is happening now.  They need the money now. The sea walls need to be built now. The water supplies need to be  secured now. So we've got to see those funds flowing now.

JEREMY FERNANDEZ: For the donor community though, one of the problems, of course,  is in getting the Pacific islands to show due diligence and transparency in the way these funds  are used. How do you respond to that argument, that, you know, until the Pacific islands can  guarantee some level of — of clarity that it's difficult for these funds to flow?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, our funds are flowing. You can work with the Pacific  countries.

We're talking about developing countries and sometimes systems aren't as robust as they  might be in a developed country but that doesn't mean that you can't work with these  countries.

Nor does it mean that you can't properly acquit and account for the money that is spent in  these countries and we're able to do it.

What it takes is some political will to come forth with the money which the donor community  have said they will and actually spend it where it's needed. That's what we're doing.

You know, I've stood on sea walls which have been built with Australian money. I've gone to  sites which test the quality of water of wells in Kiribati which are being protected with  Australian money.

It's really important that we see the money from other countries in the donor community  coming to help countries like Kiribati.

JEREMY FERNANDEZ: How much of this problem is going to be solved through  adaptation and mitigation or is a refugee -a climate refugee program going to be a key part of  what happens from here?

RICHARD MARLES: It's a question often asked, Jeremy, and the first step is this.

We've got to do everything we can in terms of mitigating the effects of climate change. That  is, seeing emission reductions. That's where the main global effort is and it's where it should  be.

It's why countries around the world are trying to do what they can to reduce emissions, to  keep global climate change within that two degree band which will limit the effects of  climate change.

But, the scientists tell us, the amount of emissions that have already occurred means there's a  certain degree of climate change locked in.

So, you're going to see some effects of that. This means you do need to come up with some  engineering solutions which protect these countries from the climate change already  occurring or already locked in.

In terms of the final part of your question, about whether or not we will see climate change  refugees, it's a question which has clearly been thought about. But, I think it is a fair way  down the track.

If you talk to these countries, their overwhelming preference is to focus on an end to the  problem which will allow them to stay in the countries which are their home. That's perfectly  natural. I think anyone would understand that sentiment. So, that's really where the focus of  the effort is.

JEREMY FERNANDEZ: All right, Richard Marles in Auckland, thanks so much for your  time.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks very much, Jeremy.
