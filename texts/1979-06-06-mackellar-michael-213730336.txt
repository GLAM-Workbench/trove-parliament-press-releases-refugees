"SELF KELP" GRANTS REACH $150,000

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr MacKellar, announced five more special migrant project grants

today,  bringing the total made so far to 48.

The amount of $150,000 allocated for such grants this

financial year had now been committed, Mr MacKellar said.

The grants were made in line with recommendations of '

the Galbally Report on Programs and Services to Migrants to

encourage "self help" among ethnic communities.

Further applications were still being sought for

consideration in the second and third years of the Galbally

implementation program,

Three of today's 5 new grants,  totalling $19,082 were

made to umbrella bodies representing unions.

This reflected the Galbally Report's conclusion that

ethnic communities need more information about the role of unions

in Australian society.
