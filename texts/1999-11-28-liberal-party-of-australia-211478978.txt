TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER

THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - DILI, EAST TIMOR

Â

E&OEÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Howard, what are your impressions of Dili? Is it in better or worse 
shape than you expected?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well it's in about the shape that I expected. My overwhelming impression 
is one of even greater admiration for the tremendous job that the INTERFET 
forces and naturally as the Australian Prime Minister, the Australian 
forces have done. General Cosgrove has done our nation and the cause 
of international reconciliation in this area proud. He's provided magnificent 
leadership through the INTERFET forces. The effort here is a combination 
of restoring authority, peace and stability, but also compassionate 
help. I've just visited a hospital where a magnificent service is being 
provided by the Australian medical personnel, not only for our own people 
who need help, but also for the people of East Timor.

Â

Obviously there's an enormous amount of devastation. We've all seen 
a lot of it but there's nothing quite like actually witnessing it first 
hand with the naked eye. But the progress that's being made in terms 
of restoring peace and stability has been quite remarkable and I've 
had a very constructive discussion with the INTERFET leader, Mr De Mello 
and we're well on track for the hand over to a Blue Helmet operation. 
But it should never be forgotten that the INTERFET group led by General 
Cosgrove to which many countries have contributed, not least Australia. 
And I thank all of those countries for their contribution. Without their 
help we would not be looking at a situation where peace and stability 
which was the prime element of the mandate has been essentially restored

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Howard, Xanana Gusmao before leaving for Jakarta suggested that 
perhaps [inaudible] operation could be done more cheaply as [inaudible].

Â

Well I think it's being done very efficiently. And I think professional 
soldiers know more about economies of scale and necessary deployment 
of resources when it comes to an operation of this kind than anybody 
else.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

[inaudible] Indonesia have any recent [inaudible]?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

No. This territory of course is no longer part of Indonesia. I've 
come here to do what any Australian Prime Minister would do and that 
is to personally express the gratitude of the Australian people to the 
men and women of the Australian defence forces led by General Cosgrove. 
I've come here to do that and I make absolutely no apology to anybody 
for doing that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Howard, the Human Rights Commission has asked General Cosgrove 
to perhaps make available to them intelligence reports that they've 
collected. I think, I understand General Cosgrove has declined to help. 
He suggested that they speak to the Australian Government.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well we'll consider the request.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Sir, what kind of assistance can you provide in terms of forensic 
investigative ability?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well we were asked today by Mr De Mello whether we would and I said 
that I would consider that request. Those sort of assets in Australia, 
those sort of personnel in Australia are under the control of State 
governments. They are attached to State coroners and so forth. In our 
system of government I can't direct State coroners. I've got to talk 
to State governments. But I undertook to discuss it. We will be very 
keen to do what we can in a number of areas. Australia's already given 
very very high amounts of aid as well as making the major military contribution 
to the INTERFET force. So I don't think anybody can suggest that Australia's 
been dragging her feet on anything.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Can you tell us what Australia' s commitment will be for the UN peacekeeping 
force?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

How much money do you think you'll have to commit for the longer term 
task of rebuilding East Timor obviously on top of defence costs to be 
covered by the Timor....?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well we will commit substantial resources but I'm not going to try 
and put a figure on that because I don't think anybody quite knows how 
far it goes.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

[inaudible], did it only justify the new levy that you've imposed?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Absolutely. Absolutely. I think this operation has brought enormous 
credit to Australia. It's particularly brought credit to the men and 
women of the Australian Defence Force. Every last one of them has done 
their country proud. Every last one of them has not only been a good 
soldier, sailor or airman, but also been a great ambassador for Australia. 
And winning the confidence and the respect and the friendship, and providing 
the hand of friendship to the people of East Timor is very much part 
of the operation and it's very evident, not only here in the hospital 
but elsewhere that the Australian forces have done exactly that. And 
I thank them most warmly on behalf of all of the Australian people for 
the job they've done. Remember it was a dangerous unchartered operation 
when it started. From the vantage point of relative peace and stability 
it is easy to forget that it was a mission fraught with a great deal 
of danger back on the   20th  
of September. I don't forget that, and I don't want, and I'm sure they 
won't, the Australian people to forget that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Howard, [inaudible] coming to East Timor on the 24  th  
anniversary of Fretilin's original declaration of independence in '75?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

No it is purely coincidental. This was the appropriate time for me 
to come both for the convenience of INTERFET and also my own. That's 
an interesting coincidence but it was not deliberately chosen.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

And Mr Gusmao left. Is that another coincidence or a plot?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well its immaterial because I came here to thank the Australian forces. 
That was my reason. I've already had a discussion with Mr Gusmao and 
I didn't plan this visit around his availability. I planned this visit 
overwhelmingly to say thank you on behalf of the people of Australia 
to the men and women of the ADF.

Â

[inaudible], how long do you think it will be until the Blue Helmet 
operation takes over?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

We're looking in the early part of next year. Well you know, very 
early part of next year. I know from experience you don't get too specific 
on that or else you come back and say why didn't it happen by such and 
such a date, won't you?

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Howard new reports this morning about the government offering the 
600 remaining East Timorese refugees in Australia a bag of rice and 
a blanket to come back home by the December deadline. Is that a fair 
offer considering we gave the Kosovars $3000 a head to leave?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well I think you should make some allowance for the enormous amount 
of aid we've given to East Timor. When you take that into account we 
have been very generous indeed. So don't just stick on one thing like 
that. You know, allow for the total contribution, and we've put tens 
of millions of dollars of aid the way of East Timor and we will be doing 
more in the future. The Australian people have been very generous. We 
remember the East Timorese people from World War II. And the Australian 
people support in every way the effort that's gone into helping this 
country. Let's not have any nit picking over just one isolated part 
of the overall assistance which from Australia has been very generous. 
Thank you.
