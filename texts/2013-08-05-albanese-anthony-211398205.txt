KARL STEFANOVIC:                    Right now Deputy Prime Minister Anthony  Albanese is in our Parliament House studios.  G’day Anthony.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               G’day Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    Today’s poll is not flash for you. You aren’t  going to change leaders again are you?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               We have made our choice and we are very  confident that our positive plans for the future  will be contrasted with Tony Abbott and his  negativity. You can’t get through a campagin  just saying no, no, no Karl. He will have to  come up with a policy eventually.

We, in contrast, have serious plans for the

future on education with the Better Schools  plan; we had Victoria sign up yesterday. On the  National Disability Scheme, on the National  Broadband Network.

All of these policies and plans are out there  dealing with the challenges of the future  represented by the decline in the China  resources boom. This is a time where we need  a steady hand, not someone who is reckless.  Might have been a good Opposition Leader,  Tony Abbott, no question about that. But he’s  not up to being Prime Minister.

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    Tough way to start the campaign though with  those poll results this morning, and also those  economic figures towards the end of last week  especially when you are basing things on trust.  He’s calling himself Kevin Rudd the underdog,  but hadn’t you hoped the changes he made in  the last couple of weeks would have led to  better poll results?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               Look Karl, we start off the election campaign  slightly behind, but we are certainly  competitive. Tony Abbott has refused to debate  Kevin Rudd, he’s not ready for a debate  tonight. Kevin Rudd is up for it, as he has been  up for three debates over asylum seekers, over  climate change, over the economy, debt and  deficit.

He has been prepared to debate Tony

Abbott. Tony Abbott has been running from the  debate as he ran from Parliament during the  last term.

But you can’t keep running from debates and  during this campaign we are very confident  about our vision for the future - our positive  plan with new ways such as the National  Broadband Network, which will support new  industries. As opposed to Opposition who have  been pretty good at the negative politics but I  think Australians want more than that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    Alright, you have said that it’s about trust -  Kevin Rudd said it was about trust yesterday -  you have got to build up trust based on the  past and the past hasn’t been terrific for you.  I’m taking a look at pink batts, the BER, the  carbon tax, chopping and changing leaders,  incidents with Eddie Obeid, the list is very long  and it’s very hard to overcome.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               Let’s have a look at that Karl. The BER - there  are school facilities, new libraries, new school  facilities right around every school in Australia  now. There were less than one per cent of  issues with it. I tell you what, if I get 100 trades  people into my home and there is less than

one per cent of difficulties after they leave,  that’s not a bad outcome.

What we did was see Australia through the

Global Financial Crisis in partnership with the  Australian people and the business community.  We’ve shown that we can make the big calls  and get them right. We did that.

If you compare Australia with the rest of the  world, we have low inflation, we have low  interest rates, we have relatively low  unemployment, we have higher workforce  participation, we have economic growth.

The fundamentals are good but there are risks  in terms of what is occuring in China, the  writedown in the global economy meant that  we had to deal with that last week. We dealt  with it honestly and upfront Karl. We didn’t try  to guild the lily and slide through until after the  election -

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    It’s always better to be honest about your stuff  ups.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               We’re not responsible for the entire global  economy Karl -

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    I understand that, I understand that. Let’s  move on though. What about the Daily  Telegraph this morning? They don’t hold back.  Look who’s back, Col Allan with that front  page, “Kick this mob out” and the editorial  doesn’t miss:

“Kevin Rudd is the leader of a Government that  attempted to intimidate a free media into docile  compliance, silence. Kevin Rudd is the leader  of a Government that didn’t keep its word on  the carbon tax, a Government that didn’t keep  its word on delivering a surplus, a Government  that in the end didn’t keep its word on a 2013  election date.”

Response?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               Pretty extraordinary, and I think Australians  are a bit smarter than looking at that headline  and going oh well, that must be right. They will  look for what the agenda is behind the  headline.

It’s not terribly subtle and in terms of the

media, I reckon Telegraph readers will be  picking that up and thinking well I deserve  better than that as a Telegraph reader. That is  an extraordinary intervention on day one of an  election campaign.

We saw headlines last week all along the

same way, and guess what Karl, if we hadn’t  called the election yesterday the Daily  Telegraph front page would have been why  haven’t they called the election? Today they  bag us on page one for calling the election!

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    You’ve got a fight with News Limited at the  start of your election campaign, that’s not flash.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               They will make their own judgments. We do  have a free media in Australia, but we also  have freedom to look at it critically. And people  will look at it critically. People will wonder what  discussions have taken place in order for a  headline like that to occur.

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    Alright, well we will let the intrigue continue. I  want to finish with this one though, it’s been an  interesting start to the campaign. I don’t want it  all to be about negativity though. I’m going to  ask you this question, Anthony, we’ve known  each other for a while now. What’s the best  thing about Tony Abbott?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               I think his commitment to family is very  genuine and I think that is important. I get on  with him okay outside of politics, and he is a  believer in the Liberal Party and in their brand.  I am a believer in the Labor Party. I respect  that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    Well answered my friend, well answered.  Good luck in the campaign, we will see you  along the way.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:               Thanks mate, good to talk to you.

KARL STEFANOVIC:                    You too.
