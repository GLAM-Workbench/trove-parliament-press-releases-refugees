E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well, look, it’s great to be here in Darwin at the home of Steve and Tory Mencshelyi, Steve is with the  First Armoured Brigade and he’s out on manoeuvres, as I understand it, but it’s good to have so many  defence families here with us today. I am also very pleased to be with Natasha Griggs, our candidate for  Soloman and also with Senator David Johnston, the Shadow Minister for Defence. Natasha is a terrific  candidate, she’s a Territorian through and through, she will be the Territory’s representative in Canberra, not  Canberra’s representative in the Territory, should she be elected and of course Dave Johnston has done a  really outstanding job as the Shadow Minister for Defence, there would be no Member of the Federal  Parliament with the welfare of Defence forces closer to his heart than Senator David Johnston, so it’s great  to be with both of my colleagues here today at Steve and Tory’s place.

I have two announcements to make. The first is a better deal when it comes to the health care of Defence  families. Defence families should never be neglected. We send out Defence force personnel overseas, often  on dangerous missions and the people they leave behind are serving their country almost as much as the  people who are actually in the armed forces. So, we’ve got to look after them and so I announce today that  unlike the Rudd-Gillard Government, which made a promise and failed to live up to it, the Coalition will  deliver free basic medical and dental care to the families of serving Defence force personnel. This is a $77  million announcement. It should ensure that all Defence families get access at no cost to the basic medical  and dental treatment that they have a right to expect.

The other announcement that I make today is that Winnellie, were there are currently 100 vacant Defence  houses not helping with the very serious shortage of housing and the very high cost of housing here in this  great Defence city of Darwin, the 396 Defence houses at Winnellie will be excised from the base and they  will be available as part of the ordinary housing stock of the city of Darwin.

It’s very important that we in the Coalition acknowledge the cost of living pressures on Australian families.  The announcements I make today are about addressing, in particular, the cost of living pressures on Defence  families, but all Australian families are under cost of living pressure and the announcements that I’ve been  progressively making in the course of this campaign are designed to ease the pressure on Australian  families. Of course, the thing that I suppose I can most do, in terms of easing the pressure on Australian  families, is say no to a carbon tax, because if there is one thing that is going to add to the price pressure on

2

Australian families, it’s the coming carbon tax, should Labor be re-elected. As we know, electricity prices  have gone up by 35 per cent since November 2007 and they’ll go up a lot, lot more if Labor is re-elected and  because of the preference deal with the Greens ends up imposing a carbon tax on everything.

But look, this is an important sign today of our commitment to Australia’s Defence families, their husbands,  their fathers, their wives, their mothers, are wearing our uniform, they’re doing great work for us, the ones  they leave behind should never be forgotten and they certainly won’t be forgotten under the Coalition.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, in Battlelines, you foreshadowed a broader general health scheme for all Australians because  you said it was a missing part of health care in Australia. Why just for Defence families today and you can’t  say that there’s not any money because you’re willing to spend $2.5 billion on a corporate tax cut.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the point I made in Battlelines was that you can do a lot more with the Budget in massive surplus than  you can when the Budget is in massive deficit and the problem is that the current Rudd-Gillard Government  has massively mortgaged our future and I just don’t believe that it would be responsible to do more than we  are currently doing at this time. I do point out, though, that one of the final acts of the Howard Government  was to introduce the Medicare dental scheme, which is proving very, very beneficial, particularly for older  Australians with serious dental problem, that’s a scheme that the Coalition is totally committed to. It’s a  scheme which the Rudd-Gillard Government has pledged to abolish, has tried to abolish. We were only  saved from its abolition by the good work of Opposition Senators in the Upper House.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, over what period of time is that funding commitment and how is it going to be used to boost  medical and dental services?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well, I might ask David Johnston to add a bit here, but it’s going to be spent over the forward estimates  period from the 1st of July next year. Essentially, if you’ve got a Defence card you will be entitled to $320  worth of dental treatment a year, that’s my understanding. If you’ve got the Defence card, you’ll be entitled  to an additional rebate at the practice of a registered doctor, essentially, what we are doing is modelled on  the very limited scheme which the Government has put in. The scheme that the Government has put in  serves only a small minority of Defence force personnel. We will extend the scheme so that it looks after all  Defence families. David, do you want to add to that?

DAVID JOHNSTON:

Sure, sure. Thanks Tony. The current Labor scheme is virtually a trial covering a quarter of Defence  personnel. We’re going to keep that money and add to it, so that we can cover all Defence personnel. So  they’re covering abut 16,000 Defence personnel, we’re going to cover 64,000 Defence personnel and the  total cost is going to be just over $100 million. We’re adding to the Labor Party money to bring it up so that  this is a promise in action, alive and visible for all Defence personnel to see when Kevin Rudd and Labor  promised they’d do this all before the last election and then welched on the promise.

QUESTION:

(inaudible)

DAVID JOHNSTON:

No, no. It is not. This money is going to be found from within Defence, it is, it has the capacity to go to all  the remote bases to provide the very necessary dental care for the partners and dependants of Defence  personnel, as was promised to them. We’re going to deliver. It was all doorstop and no delivery under Kevin  Rudd.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what’s going to be done with the money that will come from releasing this land for sale and 100  houses are vacant, what happens to the 295 people who are already living there? Won’t they be struggling to  find a place in a tight market?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ll obviously want to carefully work through the exact process as to how this happens but the fact is that  the Darwin housing market is so tight, is so expensive, there is such scarcity that it is just wrong to have  those 100 houses vacant and yet we are inevitably going to have that kind of situation, while this remains  Defence housing. Now, it will still be available to Defence personnel under the ordinary kind of rental  subsidy arrangements, which Defence personnel can have so the people who are currently in there need not  fear eviction, any arrangements that we put in place will ensure that they are properly locked after but, over  time, it is important that this land at Winnellie is used properly to address the kind of housing problems that  a city like Darwin has.

QUESTION:

Polls seem to say that you’re the underdog in this election, but after looking at this mornings polls, do you  feel that way?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, polls go up and down and I think I am very much the underdog in this election campaign. I think that  what I really should be focusing on and I think what the public are focusing on is the field evidence and this  is a government which has terribly disappointed people, this is a government which has turned out to be  good at politics but hopeless at government and I think the public are starting to understand that, they’re  starting to appreciate that these guys are all spin and no substance, that they just cannot deliver for the  people of Australia and the sorts of reports we’ve had this morning suggest that some senior members of the  Government don’t take their responsibilities seriously. There could be no heavier responsibility on a  member of the Government than to diligently attend on meetings of the National Security Committee of the  Cabinet and yet, senior members of the Government appear to have neglected those responsibilities.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, will you attend all meetings of the NSC?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you can hardly have a meeting of the NSC without the Prime Minister. I mean, without the Prime  Minister it’s not possible to have an effective meeting of the NSC and you could hardly have a meeting  without the Deputy Prime Minister either and that’s the problem here. The National Security Committee of  the Cabinet is the principal management vehicle for our overseas defence commitments, for our border  protection policy and if that Committee is being neglected by senior Ministers who think that politics is  more important than Government, then we’ve got a problem and in a sense there’s no wonder that border

4

protection has failed under this Government when senior Ministers haven’t even turned up to National  Security Committee meetings.

QUESTION:

Just on defence matters. You suggested earlier this year you would send more troops to Afghanistan if you  became Prime Minister. Are you backing away from that position now?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m strongly supporting our commitment to Afghanistan. The Coalition has always strongly supported our  commitment to Afghanistan. We initiated a commitment to Afghanistan at the very beginning of the war on  terror. The Coalition will never walk away from our defence responsibilities. We will support our allies, and  we will pull our weight in the wider world.

QUESTION:

But, I think it was at the Lowy Institute, you clearly flagged that you were open to sending more troops. Is  that commitment still there?

TONY ABBOTT:

What I said at the time was that we would respond appropriately to changing circumstances. Now,  circumstances haven’t changed, which is why we support our existing commitment.

QUESTION:

Just on yesterday’s disabilities announcement, Mr Abbott, I didn’t get time enough to digest the policy  before we could ask questions. So I’m just wondering can you clarify what ‘severely disabled’ means,  please? Will children with Down syndrome be eligible, because there has been a lot of criticism from the  AEU that only a fraction of children with disabilities will be eligible for the education card?

TONY ABBOTT:

There were a number of features of the announcement yesterday, and one of the things that we want to do is  work with the relevant state and territory authorities on these definitions, so we have clear national  definitions right around our country. Now we also said in the announcement yesterday, Christopher Pyne  made this very clear, that this is not the last word. It is a first step. It is a significant first step, but initially we  envisage that 6,000 very, very disabled children will get access to this particular education card. Over time,  as the budgetary position of the Commonwealth improves, we’d like to extend it further.

QUESTION:

The Government’s questioning your commitment to paid parental leave scheme. Costings to the Treasury  last night show over a dozen cuts, and one of the areas is paid parental leave scheme. How can you explain  that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously, when our scheme is in place, the Government’s scheme will be redundant. But we are committed  to a much better scheme than the Government. The Government’s scheme is not really paid parental leave.  It’s effectively just the rebadged Baby Bonus. If it’s going to be paid parental leave it’s got to pay parents at  their wage. And that’s the thing that the Government’s scheme doesn’t do, and why it’s not really a proper  paid parental leave scheme at all.

QUESTION:

On National Security Meetings, does the Coalition seriously want Julia Gillard to break long-standing  tradition and long-standing practice and release her attendance records?

TONY ABBOTT:

She was quite happy to talk about what she may or may not have said at a Cabinet meeting just the other day  to defend her record and I think that now that she’s established the precedent of talking about what was said  in Cabinet and who was there, I think she should come clean and tell us exactly who was at National  Security Committee meetings and if people weren’t at meetings, if people had substitutes at meetings, why  they had substitutes at meetings, because, as I said, there can hardly be a heavier responsibility in  government than ensuring that our armed forces are being properly attended to, and the main mechanism for  that is through the National Security Committee of Cabinet.

QUESTION:

Would you hold yourself to the same standard, and release your own attendance records for these meetings  if you win government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I wasn’t in the National Security Committee of Cabinet in my time and to the best of my recollection I  missed very few cabinet meetings, and always with leave in advance from the Prime Minister. But as I said,  you can’t have a meeting of the National Security Committee, you can’t really have a proper meeting of this  committee, without the Prime Ministers attendance and it seems that under the Rudd-Gillard Government  both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have not only been absent, but they’ve thought so  little of it that they sent in some cases relatively junior staff as their representatives. This is just no way to  run a government. It’s not a grown up government when its leaders are more interested in politics than in  government, when its leaders are more interested in spin than they are in actually trying to exercise  appropriate political stewardship over our armed forces.

QUESTION:

At the last election Labor made a commitment to brief the public through the media about, not the content of  Cabinet meetings, but any decision that were taken. That never really came to pass. Do you make a  commitment to do the same thing if you won government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that was a silly commitment by people who didn’t understand what it was like to run an adult  government, and I notice that it only lasted two or three Cabinet meetings and then it was dropped. Now,  I’m not going to make foolish commitments in an election.

QUESTION:

Just another question on the polls, Nielsen says this morning that you’ve pretty much closed the gender gap  in the space of less than a week. Do you think that your wife and your daughters are the magic ingredient,  and can we see more of them in the next three weeks?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think these polls are very volatile. I think the polls will go up and down, and as I said I’m looking at the  field evidence and the field evidence is that this has been a bad Government that does not deserve to be re-

6

elected, and I will be working night and day between now and the 21st of August, first to hold this  Government to account and second to present credible alternative policies that will demonstrate to the  Australian people that we are worthy of their trust.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] … it either worked or it didn’t. These polls are suggesting that it did work, didn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point that I tried to make is that, I mean, Margie obviously has a deep and abiding interest in child  care policy and I was honoured that she came out with me that day when we made an important child care  announcement that would help to take the cost of living pressure off struggling families. But the other point  I’ve made is that if I want to see my family at the moment they’ve got to come on the campaign trail with  me, because an election campaign is a very intense time, and inevitably I don’t get home much. And I’m not  complaining, but I think it’s terrific that my family, at least some members of the family are prepared to  come out and join me on the trail.

QUESTION:

Do you think the polls actually mean that it’s the Government that is doing bad, rather than you doing well?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, I’m just not going to get in to a running commentary on things that go up and down, and which are  obviously at the moment quite volatile. But I just think that what we’ve got here is a Government that people  invested a lot of hope in, they always do invest a lot of hope in new governments and it’s a Government  which has broken promises, which has wasted money, and which has threatened our economic security with  its great big new tax on mining and the coming carbon tax and not only that, it’s executed its own Prime  Minister. I think that the Australian public are rightly very, very anxious about renewing their contract with  such a Government. It’s a Government which has let them down, and why should they entrust it again.

QUESTION:

Kevin Rudd [inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, look, of course I do. Kevin Rudd is a former Australian Prime Minister, and he deserves to be treated  with respect and dignity, and he’s been through, obviously, a very traumatic time, and I wish him all the best  for a swift recovery. He does deserve to be treated with respect and appreciation by the Australian people  and while I had many, many arguments with Kevin Rudd, I think he deserves to be treated with respect,  particularly at this time.

QUESTION:

The Liberal Party re-launched the Kevin O’Lemon ads yesterday. Is that treating him with respect?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m sorry?

QUESTION:

The Kevin O’Lemon ads re-emerged yesterday. Is that treating him with respect?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point is that this has been a change that hasn’t made a difference. I mean, what we’ve seen since Julia  Gillard became Prime Minister is that things have gone from bad to worse. I mean, there was a mining tax  fix which wasn’t a fix. There was the boat people fix that never really existed. There’s the carbon fix, the  climate change fix, which is just a complete and utter abdication of leadership, where it isn’t just a deceptive  pre-election ploy. So the thing is that ad that you referred to was basically making the point that things have  gone from bad to worse since the changeover. Thank you.
