PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE

CANBERRA, 20 MAY, 1975

Prime Minister: Perhaps I should express my great satisfaction at .   the -progress that the Family Law Bill has made yesterday and today.  The central parts of the Bill have received the approval of both  the Senate last year and now the House of Representatives. Australia, in consequence, will have the most advanced, most

enlightened matrimonial and family law in the world. The  medieval concepts of guilt and fault will be removed from divorce  proceedings. The sole ground for divorce will be the irretrievable  breakdown of marriage, manifested by 12 months separation. An _ _ _

entirely new court, the Family Court of Australia, will be set  up to handle divorce proceedings and to administer an extensive  machinery for reconciliation. The whole tragic business of  divorce will be handled in an atmosphere now of dignity and

compassion, taking full account of the welfare of children and  the interests and feelings of the partners. By recognising the  fundamental status of marriage as a profoundly personal human  relationship, a relationship requiring the full consent, the  continuing consent, of two partners, a contract founded on the  free, voluntary and absolute commitment of both sides yet vulnerable  to the human frailties of either side, the Bill will give fresh and  meaningful stature to the institution of marriage itself.

This has been an essehtially non-party measure; it was in the  Senate, it was in the Senate Committee which considered it, it  has been in the House of Representatives, both on the second  reading and now in the Committee stages. Yet I see it as the.  most progressive and extensive social reform achieved during the

term of m y 'Government. I believe Australians owe a lasting debt  to the architect of the Bill, the former Attorney-General, Mr. Justice Lionel Murphy. We have come a long way since the  marriage and divorce laws in this country were dispersed in a  confused and generally repressive tangle among the statute books  of the six different States and the different Federal Territories.  And on this occasion I don't forget the role played by Mr. Justice  Joske, by the present Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Garfield  Barwick, when he was Attorney-General and I think abbve all now,  Mr. Justice Murphy. .

Are there any questions?

Question: Will you give an assurance now, Sir, that you will honour your election promise to abolish the means test in the life  of this Parliament?

Prime Minister: Yes. This Parliament has until the middle of 1977  to run. And by that time I'm certain that every man and woman of  65 or above will have the age pension without means tests. I've  given that undertaking on behalf of the party so often that I

shouldn't think that anybody would now doubt it.

2 .

Question: It's a subject of discussion at the moment, Sir, that's why I raised it. ’

Prime Minister: Maybe, but you asked me and I gave the answer  that.1 would have given throughout.

Question: Are you satisfied with the performance of Dr. Cass as Minister for the Environment?

Prime Minister: I believe that the question of the environment  will be handled more effectively and expeditiously from now on.

{ Â· Â·

Question: In view of your apparent acceptance that sand mining will not harm the environment at Fraser Island, can you  state your attitude now to oil drilling on the Barrier Reef?  Should the Queensland Government grant leases?

Prime Minister: Now, you misrepresent my attitude. I'm not  saying that I'm satisfied with sand mining on Fraser Island. I've never said that. What I have asserted is that it is not  possible, constitutionally or legally, in my view, and the  view of the Government, to make our procedures retrospective.  That's what I've said-tand the companies which were given

authorisation by the responsible Minister to export sand  minerals from Fraser Island had been engaged in preparation  for that for many years. The dates were given at question  time today. And they had completely complied with the law.

Now the attitude that my Government has taken throughout has  been that in respect to contracts for sales overseas, it will  not break those contracts, it will not force the breaking of  those contracts. It will see that contracts are honoured. And

we have taken that attitude throughout. We cari't take a different  attitude on Fraser Island to the attitude we have taken previously  You mention the question of the Barrier Reef and oil drilling Â·   there. The legal position is different there. There has not  been drilling there in recent years, it has been suspended for  over four years pending the Royal Commissions issued by the  Australian and the Queensland Government to Mr. Justice Wallace

and his two colleagues. The Australian Government will be  considering those Royal Commissions report on Friday morning. I would expe'ct that we will adhere to the point of view which  I had forecast that we will accept Mr. Justice Wallace's recomÂ­ mendation that in the present state of knowledge, oil drilling

should not take place on the Barrier Reef. Now in our view,  and it has been asserted, of course, in the Seas and Submerged  Lands Act, at present under challenge in the High Court,  substantially, almost precisely, the same Bill that Sir Reginald  Schwartz introduced under Foreign Minister McMahon, under Prime  Minister Gorton in April 1970, the sea bed there is within Federal

jurisdiction. And therefore, the granting of permits of this  character in the sea bed around the Great Barrier Reef is a  matter of Federal jurisdiction. Similarly, of course, it's a

3 .

matter of Federal jurisdiction in respect of the Northern  Territory, in particular in respect to uranium and bauxite found  '  which are principally in the Northern Territory. Now there's  a different situation as regards sand mining, coal, iron ore

and so on, in the States. My Government ....

Question: Why wasn't export approval given for those two leases?

Prime Minister: Because there was no legal ground to refuse  the export authorisation. No legal ground. The companies  had for years, before my Government was elected, complied with  .  the requirements of the Queensland law. There has been an  environmental public inquiry about three or four years ago,  before we came in, under Queensland law. All the leases and  all the conditions had been granted, observed under QueenslandÂ»

law. In those circumstances it was not possible for us to set  the law aside. The position is different on the Barrier Reef *  or at least the sea bed in our view, because we believe  that's Federal jurisdiction and in the Northern Territory where  everybody agrees it's Fede.ral jurisdiction.

Question: What led you to believe that the environment would be better managed in the future?

Prime Minister: Because I believe the delay by the Department  and the Minister have now been brought sufficiently to their  attention.

Question: When you say that there is no legal ground to

refuse exports surely that flies in the face the export powers  you have which Mr. Connor has used, on other occasions, and  has threatened to use, for instance, in relation to coal with .   Utah State onshore mining, with, gas onshore from central Australia

etc. etc., and South Australia exports, the power has been planted  on a number of occasions to clearly lie with the Federal  Government. How can you say that there are no legal grounds to  refuse exports?

Prime Minister: Well if you don't mind, I don't want to argue  the constitution law in detail with you ....

Question: Just very briefly would do ...

Prime Minister: No well, I ?ll bear with you. The Constitution  gives the Federal Parliament the responsibility to pass laws  with respect to trade and commerce with other countries. There  may be some other powers which don't apply in this case, for

Â»

4 .

instance, the external affairs power, but there's no treaty  or international convention covering Fraser Island, or  defence power. But there's no aspect of defence power involved  '  in Fraser Island. Now the whole question is - do environmental

factors come within trade and commerce with other countries?  Quite*apart from that, there is the question of making a law  retrospective. There was no Federal law, until last December,  none at all, and in those circumstances, whatever the constiÂ­ tutional situation may be, it would be quite wrong to make

a law retrospective, that is a basic tenet and any court would  lean against making it, making an action or contract illegal  retrospectively.

Question: Does your decision mean that you'll grant export permits for the remaining leases of Dillingham Murphy  Ores, and with all due respect to your legal expertise, Sir,  do you think you compromise your party's environmental impact Â«   policy? ' .  a

Prime Minister: No, I don't think we have. We were the  Government which extended the export prohibitions from iron  ore and uranium, where they were under our predecessors, to  coal and to bauxite and to beach sands. I mean, we did that,  and we brought in the law, the Environment Protection Impact

Proposal Act last December. We amended it again last week. We are bringing in, prbbably this week, the Great Barrier Reef  Marine Park legislation. We are drafting marine environment  protection legislation. We are doing this. I must emphasise

that you jeopardise a very great deal if you purport to make  anything which was legal, illegal retrospectively. Incidentally,  export permits or authorisations - and they are the same - have  not been sought in respect to the other leases. There will now be a public inquiry under the Federal legislation, and that ought

to be concluded within the next few months, and it may be that  shortcomings in the mining on Fraser Island would be revealed  by that inquiry as they were not revealed by the State inquiry  of 1971, and if they are, then public opinion or State pressure, or coordination, cooperation, Federal and' State, might preclude

any damage.

Question: You mentioned the Marine Environment Bill and the Barrier Beef Bill. These Bills I take it, are proceeding  on the basis that you already have power over the offshore  areas despite the fact that the High Court hasn't made a  decision on the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill. .

Prime Minister: Yes that's right, that is so.

Question: Are you worried at the suggestions that the High Court may take up to a year to make that determination?  And in the meantime, how are you going to stop the States  granting and renewing leases in offshore areas?

*

5 .

Prime Minister: I'm not going to speculate how long the .   High Court may reserve its decision in this matter. The  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  legislation which is about to come in - it was approved by  the Legislation Committee this morning - is based on the

assumption that successive Federal Governments have made  for over five years now, that the sea bed is within Federal  jurisdiction. -  ,

Question: Regarding the Mayaguez affair. Do you believe that President Ford was justified in sending in the Marines, or  do you think that his action was precipitate,could have risked  the security of the area,, and finally have you sent any note  or any message or any communication or cable to President Ford  about the matter?

Prime Minister:, No, I've sent no communication, note, cable  or letter, to use the terms of the Melbourne 'Age', and I  have no comment to offer.

Question: Have you been appraised as yet of the A.C.T.U.'s decision on indexation in Perth?

Prime Minister: No. %

Question: I understand that it was announced by Mr. Hawke about 45 minutes ago, and that they support the principle of  indexation, and call on all Australian trade unionists to do  the same. *

Prime Minister: Good.

Question:.  Apart from good, do you have any comment?

Prime Minister: No, I'm very pleased. They've done the right  thing as ^the Government did. '

Question: In view of reported denials this morning of your allegations concerning the Vietnamese family's entering Australia,  could you tell us when and how the Australian authorities were  misled in regard to this incident? '

Prime Minister: I'll quote what. I said to the Joint Parliamentary  Committee on Parliamentary Committees last night :

"I should refer to what Senator Mulverhill says about this  Australian of Vietnamese origin. What happened there was  that he misled the authorities. He said that the Acting  Prime Minister, he said Connor, had given authority for him

*

to bring certain extended relatives. Connor denies it, so  for greater precaution I thought he might have meant Cairns -  ,  Cairns denies it too. He got them in by misrepresentation." The situation is that a cable came from Guam to the Department

of Labor and Immigration on 11 May from an experienced officer.  "Sponsor travelled to Saigon after speaking to acting Prime  Minister, Connor. Sponsor claims to have been told by Acting  Prime Minister that should he succeed in getting rest of family

out of Vietnam they would also be approved." Mr. Connor denies  that he ever spoke to him or that he ever told him anything  of the nature.

Question:Soon after Labor came to power a uranium mining  company in Australia entered into a contract which was signed  and written with a Japanese electricity firm for the supply of  uranium. So far Mr. Connor has refused to honour that contract.  Under what law is he refusing to do so, other than the export .,  powers? ' :  .

Prime Minister: He assured the House today that he would honour  it, and it will be honoured. The uranium Â·...

Question: I'm'talking about a contract entered into after Labor came to power, h e 1s only previously said that he will  honour contracts entered into before Labor came to power.

Prime Minister: Well the contract to which you refer will be  honoured. It was approved by the Government. The uranium  which the company is entitled to receive by whatever "date  it is will be received by that company. The Australian

Government is in a position to ensure that that uranium will  be delivered in the terms of the contract. I made it plain  earlier, that in regard to the Northern Territory, the  Australian Government has all the powers that any State  Government has in these matters, in addition to export powers.

Question: What is your attitude to the application by B.H.P. for a price rise?

Prime Minister: The" Australian Government is responding to the  suggestion that it should provide counsel to assist the tribunal  in determining this application, and I expect in the next few  days to be conferring with the relevant Ministers on the general  terms of the view that will be put by the Government.

Question: Efforts are being made to get the trade unions '

to prevent any mining on Fraser Island. If they succeed what  would the Government's attitude and actions be?

Prime Minister: The Government has responsibilities in this  matter and I don't see that unions do.

7 .

Question: Have you received any communication from the U.N. on the distribution of refugees from Guam and can you  ,  give us any idea on the numbers although you've said that -   this is going to be left up to the U.N. largely. Have you

had any discussion about the numbers that are likely to come  to Australia?

Prime Minister: No, I can give no estimate of that at all.  There might have been some communications with the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the last day ; I  haven't seen it. The UNHCR's representatives have been

operating rather in Hong Kong, and have been trying to operate  in Singapore rather than in Guam. One feature which has not  been sufficiently emphasised is that it is quite likely that  increasing numbers of refugees and they're the only categories  with which the Australian Government would be concerned, and

even of evacuees, might be returning to Vietnam. All the  forecasts and in fact the propaganda about bloodbaths and  holocausts have not materialised and there may, therefore,  be a very considerable number, very corisiderable increase in  Vietnamese returning to their own country. That of course  would be the best outcome. Ã¢ÂÂ

Question: Are you satisfied with Mr. Connor's performance as Minister for Minerals and Energy?

Prime Minister: In the matters we have been discussing here  which is all Iy suppose you are asking about, of course. I .   think he hes been a very effective and successful Minister. He has gone as far in asserting the national interest as the

law allows. I know that some people choose to disparage him. There was some reference to Utah by one of the earlier questioners  Let me point out, that the previous Labor Government federally  made the Joint Coal Board arrangement with New South Wales, and

because of that, in New South Wales, Mr. Connor is able to assert  proper environmental conditions. In Queensland there is no such ‘   arrangement and, therefore, he has to rely on persuasion alone. Mr. Connor has a longer experience and a deeper involvement in

environmental matters than any of us.

Question: -  What mechanisms exist for the Department of the  Environment to be made aware of projects for the export of mining  products and at what stage of the projects proposal to the  Federal Government do those mechanisms come into operation?

Prime Minister: I don't know the details here. You should ask  the Ministers concerned. The Fraser Island one, of course,  the Fraser Island chronology, I know well and I cited it at  question time today.

Question: Supplementary question regarding the Vietnamese question - You "did say they gained entry by misrepresentation  ,  or words to that effect, but what was the actual misrepresentation?.   How did they get in - 24 of them?

Prime Minister: I have no supplementary answer.

Question: During your discussions with the President of the World Bank, Mr. Robert McNamara in Washington, was the  question of the Bank's Third.Window Project raised with you?

Prime Minister: Ye s .

Question: Did Mr. McNamara ask you for a contribution, ,

- did he ask for*Australia to contribute towards that project?  And to, what extent would Australia become financially involved?

Prime Minister: He raised these matters with me. I pointed  out, of course, that no commitment could be made except in  the Budget context and the Budget wouldn't be announced until.  19 August. But I did tell him that I would, qu ite soon, let

him have a tentative response, but not as to amounts. .

Question: When do you hope to renew the aids programmes in South Vietnam, the civil'aid programmes?

Prime Minister: As soon as we can establish communications with  the Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. We have, today,  instructed our Ambassador in Hanoi to establish contact- with :   the representatives of the Revolutionary Government of South  Vietnam. When we have that contact, then of course, we will

be able to resume the quite extensive aid programmes we have  in the South. We also, of course, will be able to.make our  own assessment about conditions for reconstruction, .  resettlement,  repatriation.

Question: .  Are you concerned that the Government's overtures to the new rulers," the new Government in Phnom Penh, have yet  to be acknowledged? "  _ .  -  -  Ã¢ÂÂ   -

Prime Minister: I think we are having the same time lag as  every other country is having in establishing relations with  the. new Government in Phnom Penh. -
