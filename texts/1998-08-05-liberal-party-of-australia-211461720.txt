THE 1997-98 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM OUTCOME

Â

The 1997-98 Human itarian Program has been delivered on target 
with special emphasis on meeting the resettlement needs of vulnerable 
women, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, announced today.

Â

“12,020 visas were granted during 1997-98 for the 
Humanitarian program which met the projected target of 12,000 visas. 
Of these, there were 543 visas granted under the Women at Risk program 
- exceeding the program target of 420 visas, Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“The aim of the Women at Risk program is to afford 
protection for vulnerable women for whom resettlement is the only solution.

Â

“The main beneficiaries of this visa program included 
women from the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Africa, with the 
extra visas issued in recognition of their plight.”

Â

To the end of June 1998, 10,467 Humanitarian Program 
visas were granted to people outside Australia. This comprised 4,010 
refugees (including Women at Risk), 4,636 people under the Special Humanitarian 
Program (SHP), and 1,821 people under the Special Assistance Category 
(SAC).

Â

“Of the total Humanitarian visas issued in 1997-98, 
47% were granted’ to people resettled from the former Yugoslavian 
region, 28.2% to people from the Middle East, and 14% to those from 
Africa.

Â

“In addition, 1,553 people were granted Protection 
Visas as refugees in Australia”.

Â

“The overall Humanitarian program outcome reflects 
the Government’s continuing commitment to delivering a separate, effective 
and well targeted program which puts the resettlement needs of bona 
fide refugees first.
