THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW   TALKING CANBERRA 1206 2CC WITH CHRIS MAC  WEDNESDAY 16 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S: Government’s abolition of non-contributory parent visa;  Scott Morrison refusing to reveal details of Australian customs vessel  carrying 153 asylum seekers; Senate chaos.

CHRIS MAC: Is it now time to have a quick chat with a very busy man, and I  saw him on television yesterday looking a little bit disappointed following some  matters that have occurred in the Parliament that affected his shadow portfolio  and that is the Opposition Spokesman for Border Protection, Richard Marles who  joins us this morning, Richard good morning.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION: Good morning Chris how are you?

MAC: Not too badly, I saw you on Sky News yesterday afternoon with one of  your colleagues and you were looking pretty disappointed with one of the  initiatives the Government basically did not support yesterday what was that  about?

MARLES: Well actually the first initiative that we were very concerned about  was the abolition by this Government of the non-contributory parent visa, this is  a visa that new immigrants who might be wanting to bring their family out,  particularly elderly parents, and particularly in the last years of their life to spend  with their children in Australia, that visa class has been in place for a very long  time and it’s a visa class which exists in most developed countries and that was

abolished by the Government in the Budget and so it’s not something that  necessarily a lot of people would know about if you’re not in the situation but  there are literally thousands of people who are in this situation who are now  being denied the opportunity of bringing their parents to Australia to spend the  last years of their life with them and we’re really disappointed about it and I’ve  got to say one of those issues where if you are affected by it you feel deeply  aggrieved, this is right up there.

MAC: Again this is something that would have been considered to be a fairly  bipartisan measure for quite a long time wouldn’t it?

MARLES: Yes and it’s just a sensible measure, and there would be lots of people  now who have come out to Australia to spend the last years of their life with  their children, and I think one of the points to make here is that caring for  elderly parents in many communities is a really deeply engrained cultural  tradition and it’s one which is very much rooted in the sense of respect and  respect I think is the last thing that’s been shown here by this Government.

MAC: Now there was another issue which I think you might have been actually  first on your feet in question time yesterday I believe, I was following the action  on twitter I must admit, where you asked a question of Scott Morrison and I  think this was again in relation to that missing vessel shall we say.

MARLES: Well that’s right Chris, and of course we didn’t get an answer from  Scott Morrison which I guess was hardly surprising, but we now have a situation  where there are 153 Tamil asylum seekers aboard an Australian customs vessel  somewhere we suppose in the Indian ocean. We don’t know where, we don’t  know what state those people are in, we’ve got no idea what plans the  Government has for this vessel, they clearly are awaiting the outcome of a High  Court proceeding which has got another couple of weeks we think to run, it’s not  absolutely set yet, but the idea that this Australian customs vessel is out there, it  would be costing a fair amount of money I might say as well, but the real issue  is the state of the people on board, and we are being told nothing about it, says  everything about the state of shambles this policy is in under this Government.

MAC: I thought that the boats had just about stopped, although but clearly this  had just come through, whether it’s push or pull factors, it’s almost irrelevant  now, there’s going to be some more boats from time to time, I would have  thought that this, I can understand the hard line policy, I can understand where  he’s coming from, but surely there must be a point where you review the way  you’re doing things.

MARLES: Well the issue here is that there has been overreach by this  Government in the way in which they have kept their political scoreboard,

they’ve done it day after day after day and actually that’s the only thing that they  are trying to protect, because there was a really simple play here, you bring  those people to Christmas Island, you can screen people at Christmas Island or  indeed you could do it at Manus Island, there is no chance at all that any of  these people would be offered a permanent visa in Australia under the situation  that exists now and certainly if Labor were in power that would be the case as  well, so this is not about any of these people actually coming to Australia, the  only reason though they didn’t do this was because to take a vessel to Christmas  Island was going to ruin Scott Morrison’s political scoreboard, and as a result,  we’ve now got a farcical situation, I think there are real concerns about the  potential for refoulement, that means sending people back to the place in which  they have sought to leave in circumstances where they have a genuine fear of  harm, and it’s completely unnecessary.

MAC: Unreal, there really is, I’d probably about a kilter with a few people here  and in some of our other broadcasters, by all means stop the boats and they’ve  largely done that but as you say overreaching, there just seems to be something  that didn’t have to happen, Christmas Island they could have still been re-settled  and processed and rejected but it would have been one transparent, two we’re  paying the taxes to do all this and three it just seems totally unnecessary. But  let’s move on because times starting to beat us, very quickly, the Senate and  uncle Clive as a lot of people are now calling him, what do you do with a  problem called Clive Palmer?

MARLES: Well it certainly seems to me that the man who is calling the shots of  this Government is not the Prime Minister, it’s Clive Palmer, you know we see the  farcical situation last night where the Finance Minister Mathias Cormann comes  into the Senate, starts reading out a set of words which presumably is part of the  deal which he has done with Clive Palmer, I mean Clive is now the puppet  master, and this was a Government which said that it would be in control and  that it wouldn’t do deals with minor parties, and yet what we have now is a  Government which is doing exactly that, and really if you look at the Senate over  the last couple of weeks, it is in a state of high farce, and that reflects a  Government which is not in control.

MAC: I think I’ve said, I’ve heard a few people say on social media, whatever  you think of Nick Minchin, he wouldn’t have let the situation develop that Eric  Abetz did, that would be my call I reckon.

MARLES: I reckon that’s exactly right.

MAC: Mate we’ll have to go but Richard Marles thank you very much for your  time and no doubt you’ll be speaking to Mark Parton this time next Wednesday  morning.



MARLES: Look forward to it Chris.
