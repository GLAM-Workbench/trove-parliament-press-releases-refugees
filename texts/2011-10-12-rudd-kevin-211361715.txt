including combating people smuggling, advancing PACER Plus negotiations and restoring  democracy in Fiji.

5. Mr Pala thanked the Australian Government for hosting the 20th Ministerial Forum and for  the warm welcome and hospitality the Papua New Guinean delegation had received. Mr Pala  agreed that the Forum provided a timely opportunity to strengthen and deepen bilateral  cooperation, particularly in line with the key areas that both governments had identified. Mr  Pala emphasised that Papua New Guinea, as one of the fastest-growing economies in the  region, was experiencing a period of substantial change and development. Mr Pala welcomed  that Papua New Guinea's growth and development was increasingly reflected in the bilateral  relationship, through initiatives such as the proposed economic cooperation treaty. Mr Pala  also reiterated that Papua New Guinea appreciated Australia's long-standing and continuing  support to help Papua New Guinea meet its social and economic development goals.

Bilateral cooperation

Economic Cooperation Treaty

6. The Forum recognised the commitment of both governments to sign an Economic  Cooperation Treaty, as an important step that would reflect the maturing bilateral relationship  in which economic cooperation took on a greater role. Ministers noted that officials have  commenced consideration of a broad outline of the proposed treaty and agreed that officials  would hold the first formal round of negotiations before the end of the year

AustraliaÂ­Papua New Guinea Partnership for Development

Repositioning of Australia's aid program

7. Ministers formally endorsed the Partnership for Development schedules, welcoming the  repositioning of Australia's aid program in line with the recommendations of the Joint  Review of the Development Cooperation Treaty and Papua New Guinea's own development  priorities as set out in Papua New Guinea's Vision 2050, Development Strategic Plan 2010-2030 and Medium Term Development Plan 2011-2015. The repositioned program will focus  on the flagship sectors of education, from basic through to higher education, and health,  including HIV/AIDS, with continuing support to transport infrastructure and law and justice.  It will deliver measurable results across Papua New Guinea and achieve better value for

money in key areas of need.

Education

8. The Forum agreed to the development of an overarching joint education plan taking into  account basic education, through to university, technical education and vocational training,  with a commitment from both countries to increase resources to education as a whole. The  plan reflects and extends the education schedule agreed by both countries under the  Australia-Papua New Guinea Partnership for Development and will inform future revisions to  the education schedule.

9. Australia welcomed Papua New Guinea's commitment to increase by up to 20 per cent of  its budget the amount allocated to education and the commitment to fee-free education for all  Papua New Guineans up to year 10 by 2012 and to year 12 by 2014.

10. Ministers noted that Australia is supporting the rehabilitation of national high schools to  improve the quality of university entrants with over Kina 6.5 million ($3.1 million) being  spent in 2011. Papua New Guinea acknowledged Australia's work to date on the  rehabilitation of the Papua New Guinean national high schools and noted the importance of  these schools in providing quality graduates for the tertiary sector.

11. The Forum welcomed the release of the Universities Review and endorsed this in  principle as a blueprint for future action in Papua New Guinea's tertiary education sector,  building on the commitments made by both countries to improving educational outcomes as  articulated and agreed under the Partnership for Development. The Forum noted that the  Universities Review had already informed the reorientation of Australia's education program  in Papua New Guinea and was reflected in the education schedule with indicative funding.  The Forum also acknowledged Papua New Guinea's prime responsibility for reform of  tertiary education sector.

Health and HIV/AIDS

12. The Forum acknowledged that the National Health Plan 2011-2020 and the National  HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan 2011-2015 formed the basis of this Partnership Schedule. Ministers  reaffirmed that health, including HIV/AIDS, was a key priority for the Papua New Guinean

government and for the Partnership for Development. In endorsing the Health schedule,  Ministers committed to: improving vaccination rates; increasing the percentage of supervised  deliveries; ensuring health centres had essential medical supplies, drugs and testing  equipment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; increasing condom procurement,

distribution and usage; and more effective and widespread testing of HIV/AIDS and  increasing the rates of people on appropriate medications.

Transport

13. In endorsing the Transport Schedule, Australia reiterated its commitment to continue  support for the maintenance and rehabilitation of priority national roads to improve access to  service and encourage economic growth.

Policing

14. The PNG and Australian Governments recognised the fundamental importance of rule of  law to sustainable development and the importance of effective and accountable policing in  achieving and maintaining rule of law.

15. Ministers noted the Australian Federal Police and the Royal Papua New Guinea  Constabulary have been working cooperatively since 2008 to lay the foundations for  improved service delivery and to encourage positive behaviour change within the RPNGC.  Activity was currently focussed on the development of Bomana Training College as a Centre  of Excellence as well as developing organisational governance and reform.

16. Minsters noted the RPNGC and the AFP were currently working in partnership to  develop proposals for an enhanced program of support which would build on the progress  already made. This would include support to the RPNGC during the 2012 elections in the key  areas of communications, command and control, and training.

Elections

17. The Forum noted that the 2012 Papua New Guinea National Elections presented  significant logistical challenges for the Papua New Guinean government. Papua New  Guinean Ministers confirmed the necessary resources would be made available to meet the  requirements of the PNGEC in delivering free and fair elections in 2012. Ministers agreed  that Australian support in critical areas would assist the Papua New Guinea Electoral  Commission (PNGEC) to administer elections.

18. The Forum noted the work of Australia in supporting Papua New Guinea through  AusAID's existing Electoral Support Program including a twinning agreement between the  Australian and Papua New Guinean Electoral Commissions. This Program of support was  designed to support the PNGEC to deliver on its mandate of free and fair elections.

Reduction in advisor positions

19. The Forum acknowledged the work Australia and Papua New Guinea had done to reduce  advisor numbers in response to the findings of the 2010 review of all long-term advisor  positions in Papua New Guinea. The Forum noted the recommendations of the review report,  which found that Australia's aid program was over-reliant on the use of advisors. In 2010,  Australia and Papua New Guinea agreed that approximately one-third of 487 positions would

be phased out within two years. To date, 131 positions had been ceased and plans were in  place to meet the target (181 positions to be phased out by February 2013). Participants noted  that the reduction in advisor expenditure reflected a move to increase funding available  towards direct service delivery, including provision of textbooks, school infrastructure,  teacher training, medical supplies and drugs.

Fraud and corruption

20. The Forum agreed that fraud and corruption presented a significant impediment to  development.

21. Ministers welcomed the Papua New Guinean Government's strong public commitment to  fight corruption, acknowledging efforts in areas such as the procurement and distribution of  medical supplies, and within the Department of National Planning and Monitoring.

22. Papua New Guinea and Australia noted that measures were in place to minimise the  likelihood that fraud could occur in the aid program and agreed they would take action to  prosecute fraud where it is uncovered. The Government of PNG undertook to investigate any  allegation of fraud in the aid program vigorously and in a timely manner, to ensure the  accountability and effectiveness of Australian development assistance.

Sport

23. The Forum agreed to explore the development of junior-level sport competition for young  women and men in Papua New Guinea, reflecting the important role sport can play at the  community level. The Forum acknowledged the role sport can play, including a junior rugby  league competition in the future establishment of a Papua New Guinea team in Australia's  National Rugby League competition.

Women in leadership

24. Australia welcomed Papua New Guinea's commitment to advancing the place of women  in Papua New Guinea specifically through Papua New Guinea's Equality and Participation  Bill, to ensure 22 reserved seats in Parliament for women. The Forum noted that the Bill has  passed its second reading and is scheduled for the third reading in November 2011, due to the  strong leadership of Prime Minister O'Neill.

25. Papua New Guinea acknowledged Australia's support to Papua New Guinean women  through training programs to encourage the take-up leadership positions across all aspects of  life including government, business, education, and within communities.

Defence Cooperation and Peacekeeping

26. The Forum welcomed Australia's and Papua New Guinea's longstanding commitment to  the bilateral defence relationship. The strength of the relationship was most apparent in the  close cooperation between the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) and the Australia  Defence Force (ADF). The Forum agreed that Papua New Guinea and Australia would  continue to work together to address the PNGDF's emerging personnel, infrastructure and

capability challenges, and to enhance the mutual benefit of our bilateral training. This  cooperation would enable the PNGDF and ADF to operate in true partnership on  peacekeeping, disaster relief and other regional operations.

27. The Forum congratulated Papua New Guinea on becoming a United Nations (UN) Troop  Contributing Country, noting the first PNGDF personnel to deploy as UN peacekeepers  would arrive in Darfur and South Sudan in late October 2011. Papua New Guinea expressed  appreciation to Australia for the assistance provided to enable the officers to deploy,  including force-preparation training, mission-specific personnel equipment and a  reconnaissance for senior PNGDF personnel. The Forum further noted Australia's  commitment to continue to assist the PNGDF to develop its peacekeeping capability.

PNG LNG Project

28. PNG Ministers acknowledged Australia's assistance to Papua New Guinea to manage its  resource projects, for the benefit of all Papua New Guineans.

29. The Forum welcomed the work being done by Australia and Papua New Guinea to avoid  the potential detrimental effects that might be associated with the LNG project and address  key capacity gaps in Papua New Guinean Government departments. Papua New Guinea  welcomed Australia's support for its plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund and to assist in  building Papua New Guinea capacity to undertake economic modelling.  The Forum agreed  that while Australia could provide technical assistance and advice, only Papua New Guinea

could ensure that the project succeeded and that revenues were managed responsibly for the  benefit of all Papua New Guineans.

30. Ministers noted the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments were committed to  developing a proposal to facilitate capacity building opportunities for Papua New Guinea  officials in relation to the operation of the Papua New Guinea sovereign wealth fund (SWF).  The capacity building would focus on those working within the SWF secretariat and in  providing SWF policy advice to the Papua New Guinea government. This would be achieved  though placement of PNG staff within the Future Fund, potentially other international SWFs,  and relevant Australian government departments, as well as twinning staff from these  agencies to the SWF Secretariat during its establishment phase. Subject to acceptable  operational and financial arrangements being in place, the first placements would be expected  to occur in the second half of 2012.

Manus Island and Border Security Issues

31. Australia thanked Papua New Guinea for its willingness to work with Australia on the  proposed asylum seeker assessment processing centre on Manus Island. Australia noted that  the Government was still determining its legislative response to the recent decision by the  High Court of Australia and that Ministers would consult with their Papua New Guinean  counterparts when the way ahead was clearer. Papua New Guinea reaffirmed its commitment  to helping Australia as part of a regional approach to the international problem of people  smuggling.

Work and Holiday visas

32. Australia and Papua New Guinea agreed to introduce a reciprocal Work and Holiday  (Subclass 462) visa arrangement, with Mr Bowen and Mr Pala signing a Memorandum of  Understanding. Under the agreement, Australian and PNG travellers who are aged between  18 and 30 will now be able to work and holiday in the other country for up to 12 months. The

visa requires an applicant to have the support of their government, hold or be studying  towards tertiary qualifications and to speak functional English. Ministers agreed there would  be an annual limit of 100 Work and Holiday visas for both countries.

Kokoda Track

33. Ministers agreed that the Kokoda Track symbolised the lasting bond of friendship and  mutual understanding between the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia.

34. Papua New Guinea and Australia agreed to work closely to preserve and promote the  track, and to enhance the quality of life for landowners and local communities.

35. Ministers agreed that the Second Joint Understanding (2010-2015) on the Owen Stanley  Ranges, Brown River Catchment and Kokoda Track Region, signed at the Papua New Guinea  -Australia Bilateral Meeting in Alotau, Papua New Guinea, in 2010, would provide the basis  for the continuing development and management of the Kokoda Track, including improved  service delivery and economic opportunities to communities along the track, further support  to the Kokoda Track Authority's management of the track, and the promotion of the track as a  world class tourist destination.

36. The Forum welcomed the Kokoda Initiative Annual Report for 2010-11 detailing the  excellent progress made over the past 12 months in implementing the Second Joint  Understanding for the sustainable development of the Owen Stanley Ranges, Brown River  Catchment and Kokoda Track Region and protection of its natural, cultural and historic  values.

37. The Forum agreed that the good progress to date should continue through further  cooperative work to ensure a safe and well-managed Kokoda Track, enhanced quality of life  for landowners and communities through basic services, income generation and community  development, wise use and conservation of the catchment protection area and its natural and

cultural resources and values, and building the national and international tourism potential of  the region supported by a possible future World Heritage nomination.

Torres Strait Cooperation

38. The Forum reaffirmed the Torres Strait Treaty as the basis for both countries to cooperate  and manage issues along the common border.

39. Ministers acknowledged the collaborative efforts and commitment by the governments of  Papua New Guinea and Australia in implementing the Joint Australia-Papua New Guinea  Package of Measures to address cross border health concerns. In particular, the Forum noted  the focus of activities under the Package has been the work of both Governments to move  towards effectively treating people with tuberculosis and other public health concerns in the

South Fly District of Papua New Guinea, rather than only treating those patients that can  cross the Torres Strait. The Forum welcomed the Papua New Guinean Government's  commitment of 5 million Kina and the Australian Government commitment of $1.1 million to  implement the Package of Measures and to collaboratively build tuberculosis healthcare  capacity in Western Province.

Bougainville

40. The Forum noted Australia's continued support and assistance for reconstruction and  development in Bougainville. This supported the implementation efforts of parties to the  Bougainville Peace Agreement.

Regional cooperation

Fiji

41. The Forum reaffirmed the commitment of both countries to work together to help Fiji  return to democracy and the rule of law, acknowledging the importance of maintaining  dialogue with Fiji on its return to democracy.

42. Ministers expressed concern about the human rights situation in Fiji, and called on Fiji to  ease restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of association, the freedom of trade unions to  organise and freedom of religion. Ministers reaffirmed their support for the decisions of the  Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth to suspend Fiji. They said Australia and Papua

New Guinea stood ready to assist the Fiji interim government to take concrete measures to  return to democracy and the rule of law.

PACER Plus

43. The Forum affirmed the shared interest in pursuing PACER Plus as a means of promoting  greater regional trade and economic growth in Pacific Island Forum countries. The Forum  welcomed progress to date in the PACER Plus negotiations and the September 2011 Pacific  Island Forum Leaders' decision that PACER Plus be advanced as a matter of priority.

44. The Forum warmly welcomed plans for the next PACER Plus officials' negotiating  meeting early next year, to be hosted by Australia.

Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme

45. Both countries welcomed Papua New Guinea's continued participation in Australia's  Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme and noted the Australian Government's recent  announcement expanding the scheme.

Climate Change

46. The Forum recognised climate change as a global challenge requiring concerted and  comprehensive global action. In this regard, the Forum welcomed the substantial domestic  climate action that is increasingly taking place across the world. In particular, Papua New  Guinea welcomed Australia's Clean Energy Future Plan.

47. The Forum noted Papua New Guinea and Australia's joint activities to help Papua New  Guinea adapt to the effects of climate change. The Forum agreed that reducing emissions  from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, known as REDD, can and  should make a significant contribution to the global mitigation of climate change. To this end,  the Forum noted Papua New Guinea and Australia's international leadership on REDD,  exemplified by the Forest Carbon Partnership, and agreed to continue cooperation under the

Partnership.

United Nations

48. The Forum confirmed its strong support for Australia's candidacy to the UN Security  Council for the 2013-14 term, in line with the endorsement of Australia's candidacy by the  Pacific Islands Forum.

Business Participation

49. The Forum welcomed the participation of representatives from the Australia Papua New  Guinea Business Council and the Business Council of Papua New Guinea. In discussions  with Ministers, the Business Councils noted the resources boom and arrangements being put  in place to manage growing resources revenue, such as sovereign wealth funds. There was a  shared optimism that, properly managed, PNG resources would assist sustained economic  growth and direct development dividends for the people of Papua New Guinea. Ministers  reaffirmed their commitment to creating opportunities for private sector-led growth,  including through continued dialogue with business and creating a conducive environment  for trade and investment.

50. Ministers agreed to establish a committee consisting of senior officials from each  government and senior business representatives. The committee would develop advice to  ministers on action required to enhance economic development and Australian investment in  PNG. The committee would meet at least once every six months.
