Further Excision of Australian Territory

A week after the Government’s unilateral decision to excise over 3,000 islands from Australia’s migration zone, I have today finally received a comprehensive briefing on the reasons behind last Friday’s announcement.

This briefing has shown me what a magnificent job Defence, The Australian Federal Police and other associated agencies are doing in fighting people smuggling operations and protecting our nation’s borders.

It is clear the Government’s hand against people smugglers would be greatly strengthened if it could get more effective international co-operation.

However, nothing I have heard at that briefing has dissuaded me from my initial view that the excision will do nothing to protect our borders, and could in fact achieve the exact opposite.

The agencies represented on the People Smuggling Task Force were unable to explain why this further excision would act as an effective deterrent to people smugglers.

They were also unable to give any assurance that the excision would not simply encourage people smugglers to head for the mainland, nor why the Government announced its decision late on a Friday before a holiday long weekend, without consultation.

Accordingly, I will be recommending to both Shadow Cabinet and Caucus next week that Labor votes in the Senate to disallow this further excision.

Labor stands ready to work with the Government to secure a comprehensive and lasting solution to the problem of people smuggling through effective border protection, stronger international co-ordination and closer co-operation with UN agencies and regional governments.
