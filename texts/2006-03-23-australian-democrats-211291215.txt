Permanent visas needed for West Papuans

The Australian Democrats today welcomed the Government's decision to award visas to 42 of the 43  West Papuan asylum seekers detained on Christmas Island, but said these visas must be made  permanent.

"The arrival of these West Papuan asylum seekers in Australia, including West Papuan activists, was a  stark reminder of the ongoing bloodshed in that region," Democrats' Foreign Affairs Spokesperson  Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said.

"Grave human rights abuses have taken place against the West Papuan people over a number of  decades, at the hands of the Indonesian military.

"I am heartened the Australian Government has stood up to Indonesia on this issue, despite the  Indonesian Government's claims of harm to the bilateral relationship if Australia was to grant these  visas, but Australia must now do more to end the violence in West Papua.

"Next week, the Democrats will move a motion in the Senate acknowledging the Government's decision  to offer visas to the West Papuans, and calling on the Government to do more to end the ongoing  human rights abuses in West Papua.

"The Australian Democrats will continue to pressure the Government to convert these temporary visas to  permanent visas, to offer these West Papuan refugees stability and the chance of a new life in  Australia," Senator Stott Despoja said.
