INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY

ABC RADIO NATIONAL BREAKFAST

WEDNESDAY, 9 JUNE 2010

SUBJECTS: Deaths of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, Nielsen  poll, Resource Super Profits Tax.

FRAN KELLY:

And our two regular pollies join us now: Financial Services Minister, Chris  Bowen, and Shadow Education Minister, Christopher Pyne. Gentlemen,  good morning.

CHRIS BOWEN:

Good morning, Fran. Good morning, Christopher.

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Morning, Fran. Morning, Chris.

KELLY:

Can we start this morning on the rather sombre topic at the moment of  Afghanistan, because of course we've seen this week the deadliest day for  Coalition forces in Afghanistan and two young Australian soldiers killed by  a roadside bomb. Yesterday, the Defence Minister, John Faulkner warned  us all that Afghanistan could become even more violent over coming  months.

Can I ask you, Chris Bowen, are you worried about public opinion, public  support for our commitments to Afghanistan?

BOWEN:

Well, of course any death such as these two yesterday do touch the  nation's heartstrings. I think the population understands and accepts this  is a war worth fighting, that there will be casualties along the way and  that is a great tragedy, but it is all designed to avoid greater numbers of

casualties and this is at the epicentre of our efforts to make the world a  safer place. I think our hearts would all go out to the families of the  soldiers yesterday, two young men who've had their lives cut short and I  think the nation understands that these are the inevitable casualties of  what is a very difficult situation in Afghanistan. I think they'll continue to  understand that.

KELLY:

Christopher Pyne, your leader, Tony Abbott, has said in the fairly recent  past that a Coalition Government would consider more troops to  Afghanistan. Do you think that would be a popular move?

PYNE:

I don't think it would be a popular move, Fran.

KELLY:

Do you think it's the right move?

PYNE:

It might be the right decision. If we win the election in the coming  months, that's a matter that the new Defence Minister will discuss with  the Defence chiefs, Tony Abbott, the Foreign Minister and so forth.

This is the age old question - of course, I join Chris Bowen in giving my  deepest sympathies to the families of the young men who have been  killed, which is a terrible tragedy - but the age old question which  President Kennedy used to pose is whether totalitarian regimes would  always beat democracies because democracies have a respect for human  life which totalitarian regimes don't. And it's been proven in the past that  democracies have been much more resilient than sometimes we give  them credit, and we usually do end up winning. And my view is in  Afghanistan, we mustn't lose our resolve and mustn't allow the Taliban or  the terrorists to win, and while that will mean tragedies on scales such as  the one we've seen in the last 48 hours, we have to redouble our efforts  to ensure that freedom and liberty is successful and dictatorship is not.

KELLY:

Okay. Well, Tony Abbott will have a hand in future policy there if you win  the next election.

Chris Bowen, the Nielsen poll this week shows Labor absolutely tanking in  the polls. You read those numbers in the Fairfax press on Monday. What  did you think?

BOWEN:

Well, it was a disappointing poll for the Government, no question about  that. We've known for some time we're going through a difficult period,  and if that poll would translate, we would lose the election. Tony Abbott  would become Prime Minister, Warren Truss would replace Julia Gillard as  Deputy Prime Minister, Julie Bishop would be in charge of our place in the  world and Barnaby Joyce would be sitting around the Cabinet table  making big decisions.

KELLY:

You say that as though you think it's going to scare the voters away. Is  that what you're trying to do?

BOWEN:

Well, no, I mean they're the alternative team. The election is a choice  between alternatives. I don't think there's anything wrong in simply  running through who the Opposition frontbench is, because I do think it's  a risky proposition. I think that Labor Party massively outguns the  Opposition in terms of its leadership team, and I don't think it's  inappropriate in any way to point that out, that polls are showing us  losing the election and these are the people who will be taking over.

And we have a record of achievement we are happy to point to. We will  have a forward program that we'll be talking about during the election  campaign and it's also about the Australian people making a choice. Who  do you want in charge if there's another global financial crisis? Who do  you want picking up the phone and taking the calls: Kevin Rudd and  Wayne Swan or Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey? The people who got us  through the last global financial crisis or the people who think we should  follow New Zealand's lead and have a year full of recession? And that's  the choice that the Australian people will make a judgement on later in  the year.

KELLY:

Christopher Pyne, how did you react from that line coming from the  Government in the wake of that poll, and do you think the Coalition  should be nervous about its line-up?

PYNE:

Well, I'd simply make the point, Fran, that there are five former Cabinet  Ministers in the Tony Abbott line-up, which is four more than within the  Rudd line-up when they were elected three years ago. And I'd simply pick  up the theme of Chris Bowen. If the Rudd Government is re-elected, Peter

Garrett will continue to implement programs like the pink batts program,  Julia Gillard will continue to have oversight over the school hall rip-off  program, Chris Evans will continue to be protecting our borders under the  boat people program, Penny Wong will continue to be implementing the  now non-existent emissions trading scheme policy, and the list is endless.  Chris Bowen himself, of course, I suppose he'll be breathing life back into  FuelWatch and GroceryWatch.

So let's face it, this Government doesn't have a record of achievement. It  has a record of incompetence and failure, and I think it would be very  much to the Opposition's advantage to put up people like our Cabinet  against the Rudd Government Cabinet, which has been an unmitigated  failure. It's been worse than Whitlam.

KELLY:

Okay. Let's hear now from one of your colleagues: Andrew Robb is a  former Minister, he's a former Liberal Party director, these days he's  Shadow Finance Minister, speaking yesterday about how the voters see  Kevin Rudd.

ROBB:

[grab] I think what we're seeing happen is that people voted for Kevin  Rudd in good faith, with high expectations, and they've been disillusioned  in the extreme. Yet they still voted for him. You know, in many respects,  they'd like him to perform. In my view, by parking a vote with the  Greens, they are trying to send him a message, and if he doesn't get the  message they will come - a lot of them, I think - will come to us.

KELLY:

Chris Bowen, do you agree the voters want the PM to do better? And I  guess the question is can he do better?

BOWEN:

Well, I think the fact is this, Fran. We came to office with an ambitious  agenda, a big agenda. We set out to do a lot and despite Chris' spin and  rhetoric, we have achieved a lot. We have a good, solid record of  achievement: not only getting through the global financial crisis, but we  can also point to the National Curriculum, Trades Training Centres, health  reform, more nurses and GPs being trained, all those things we can point  to.

But we accept that we haven't met everything we set out to do and the  public are frustrated about that and are sending us a message that going  forward, they'd like us to continue to work on our ambitious agenda. And

there are some people who say we set out to do too much. That's a  matter of opinion for some people, but we did set out to do a lot, and we  have done a lot but we haven't achieved everything we set out to do.  There has been a lot of Opposition obstructionism in the Senate, the  Greens have opposed our agenda, we've had, of course, trouble in  Copenhagen, but we have argued our agenda and we've achieved a lot.  Now, people -

KELLY:

Is the arguing of the agenda, perhaps, is the problem? I mean, do you  concede that the Prime Minister, for whatever reason, seems to have  trouble connecting, or that dreadful phrase, cutting through with the  electorate?

BOWEN:

No, I don't, Fran, and I think the commentariat is sometimes, frankly, a  little bit fickle about this. I mean, it's not so long ago we had the great  health debate down at the National Press Club where the Prime Minister  comprehensively outcommunicated Tony Abbott against all expectations.  And I concede - again, it comes back [inaudible] - Tony Abbott is good at  a sound grab, he's good at spin and he's good at getting a line up. I  concede that.

But when the pressure's on, he's very light on detail and the substance  isn't there. So, I mean, I'd point to the health debate, I'd point to the  week after the Budget when the Opposition Budget Reply made the  Keystone Cops look like Scotland Yard. It just showed, frankly, they're not  ready for Government…

KELLY:

Okay.

BOWEN:

We had Tony Abbott saying, 'Joe Hockey will get back to you shortly',  then Joe Hockey saying, 'Andrew Robb will get back to you shortly', then  we had a disastrous press conference from Andrew Robb, and it just  showed that when it comes to communicating substance and detail, the  Opposition is simply not ready for the task of Government.

KELLY:

Christopher Pyne, the latest polls do consistently seem to indicate that  perhaps the voters back up Chris Bowen, what he said there, because

they're not coming in behind Tony Abbott, are they? He's just as  unpopular in the recent Nielsen poll as the Prime Minister.

PYNE:

Well, I think Chris Bowen sounded like a Government that's run out of  ideas, run out of puff and full of excuses, and now, of course, running a  fear campaign against the Opposition.

KELLY:

Well, why aren't the voters coming, flocking to Tony Abbott, then?

PYNE:

But that's what governments do after they've been in power for a long  time and they run out of new plans. I mean, Chris Bowen has already  reverted to a scare campaign against the Opposition because the  Government's broken 57 promises since before the last election and  hasn't delivered.

KELLY:

Okay, but I'm coming back with all of that. What about Tony Abbott? Why  aren't the voters warming to him yet? Will they want him?

PYNE:

Well, I mean, I don't want to be a commentator on the polls, Fran. The  reality -

KELLY:

Go on.

PYNE:

[laughs] The polls speak for themselves. The AC Nielsen poll was a very  good poll for the Opposition. What it proves is the public have lost a lot of  faith in Rudd-Gillard Government. But Opposition leaders don't usually  poll very high ratings, especially Opposition leaders that are facing first  elections after a Government has lost. Kevin Rudd was extremely popular  before the last election, but we were going into an 11-and-a-half, 12th  year of being in government. The most amazing part about the polls is  how unpopular the Prime Minister has become and how quickly. I mean, it  was only last December he was still in stratospheric heights of popularity.  That's because he has let people down so badly and he doesn't seem to  listen. I mean, Peter Walsh's attack on the Labor Party in the front page

of The Australian today about how the greatest obstacle to consultation  and good government in this country is Kevin Rudd, is devastating …

KELLY:

Okay.

PYNE:

… this is a former Finance Minister in the Hawke Labor Government.

KELLY:

I've got to interrupt you because it's that time again when we have to  wind up. Last word to Chris Bowen: you're heading off to Perth for the  Community Cabinet meeting tonight. The Government's support in WA  has crashed, according to the Nielsen poll, off the back of the mining tax.

Can you give us a sense now of whether you think there will be a  compromise on the mining profits tax before the election?

BOWEN:

Well, no doubt the situation in Western Australia is quite [inaudible],  Fran. This is about the national interest. Sometimes politicians get  accused of putting short term interests ahead of the long term interest. I  don't think anybody can accuse us of doing that in relation to the  Resource Super Profits Tax because it is not easy politics, it is very hard  politics. But it's important policy.

No doubt the situation in Western Australia tonight could get quite  [inaudible], and there'll be protests and all sorts of things organised by  the mining lobby. But we'll stick to what we've said, which is we think this  is an important reform for the future. We're more than happy to sit down  with elements of the mining industry and talk through their concerns, and  as every major reform entails, we'll do so in consultation with the  industry. There are some people in the industry who think, 'Well, we're  not going to pay any more tax and we'll stop this tax and we'll bring down  the Government.' Well, we're just going to continue with the reform  process and we're more than happy to talk those elements through in  terms of implementation, of finer detail, with the elements of the mining  industry that are more than happy to do so.

KELLY:

Do you ever get nervous about losing?

BOWEN:

I worry about every election all the time, Fran, and we never take  anything for granted. But I think our record of achievement and our plan  for the future will stand us in good stead.

KELLY:

Chris Bowen, Christopher Pyne, thank you very much for joining us.

PYNE:

Pleasure, thank you.

BOWEN:

Nice talking to you, Fran.
