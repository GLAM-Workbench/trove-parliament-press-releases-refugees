TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - BEAUDESERT CIVIC CENTRE

Topics: Yitzhak Rabin, Tim Fischer, Federal Election

JOURNALIST:

The Prime Minister left you at home, Mr Howard?

HOWARD:

I think Australians will be extremely disappointed that they didn’t have a real Prime Minister  who on an occasion like this could rise above petty party politics.

JOURNALIST:

What were the circumstances? I mean could you have gone?

HOWARD:

Yes. I was ready. He knew that. His staff knew th a t He didn’t want me to go. He has a  narrowness o f mind which contrasts very unfavourably, and unfavourably for Australia, to  the attitude of President Clinton and the British Prime Minister, M r Major, who displayed a  greater sense o f occasion, a greater sense o f perspective and a greater sense o f history. It’s  typical but it will disappoint Australians who, you know at heart, want a  real Prime Minister.

JOURNALIST:

What does it say about the man?

HOWARD:

I just think Australians will be very disappointed and it’s the damage that’s done to the image  o f Australia and in a sense it is an insult to the Jewish community o f Australia that something  so tragic for the Jewish State should have been treated in partisan political fashion like this.

JOURNALIST:

...the Prime Minister has accused you o f politicking and in fact cheapening the funeral.

HOWARD:

Well the facts speak for themselves. I think most Australians will judge the Prime Minister  as having been a very petty, small minded man who fell short o f the standard expected of him  by Australians whether they vote for him or vote against him.

JOURNALIST:

On another matter, Mr Howard, there were reports today that there’s some dangerous  rumblings within the National Party of discontent with Tim Fischer. Are you concerned  about those reports?

HOWARD:

No, Tim Fischer is an outstanding National Party leader. He’s a loyal colleague, a close  friend, a reliable man in good times and bad, and I have absolutely no doubt that he enjoys  the overwhelming confidence o f his party. He does enjoy my confidence. He will make an  excellent deputy Prime Minister o f  Australia after the next election.

JOURNALIST:

There are reports that a third of his MPs are dissatisfied with him and discontented with him.  I mean are you concerned about the effect that can have on the outcome of the federal  election?

HOWARD:

No.

JOURNALIST:

Just back to the point. Why should you have gone. I mean isn’t the Prime Minister  representing the whole o f the country and every citizen here?

HOWARD:

Just look at what others have done. Any other questions?

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, you mentioned the importance o f Queensland in the coming election. Do you  think we’re going to see a fair bit o f activity from federal politicians on both sides?

HOWARD:

t

I think you have already, haven’t you? I seem to have been here on a few occasions and no  doubt my Labor opponents have been here and will be here. So over all I think you will see  quite a lot.

JOURNALIST:

Are you disappointed that it’s not a December 9 election?

HOWARD:

Oh, I don’t really mind I mean I’m ready. The Prime Minister is presumably not having an  election before Christmas because he doesn’t think he can win. He certainly cranked himself  up. He made the option possible. He did a whole lot o f things to get ready. But that’s up to  him. I’m ready whenever he is. I wouldn’t have minded one before Christmas but I ’m  perfectly content to wait. The Australian public is patient. They are waiting for him to,  electoral speaking, come round the comer.

JOURNALIST:

How important is Forde ?

HOWARD:

Oh very important. Forde is a crucial seat. Seats like Forde and Longman and Moreton and  Leichhardt, all marginal seats in Queensland, they will decide the government o f the country.  And Kay Elson here in Forde is a magnificent candidate. Her campaign has gathered a great  deal o f momentum. It’s got a lot o f grass roots support. The two Coalition parties are  working together very very closely so I’m optimistic but it’s going to be a hard slog. And no  Coalition supporter any where in Australia can take the result o f the next election for granted.

There must be no false bravado, no false confidence, no false belief that it’s going to be  easy. In fact it’s going to be very hard.

Thank you.
