THE DREYFUS CASE A CENTURY ON - TEN LESSONS FOR  AUSTRALIA*



The Hon Justice Michael Kirby AC CMG**





THE DREYFUS AFFAIR



A centenary reflection:  It is exactly a century since Alfred Dreyfus,

the French soldier who was Jewish, was finally cleared of the offence of

high  treason.   A  hundred  years  ago,  he  was  described  as  the  most

famous man in the world since the death of Napoleon1.



Yet  who  today  remembers  him  or  the  story  of  the  trials  he

underwent for providing military secrets to his country's most hated foe,

Germany?   Who  recalls  his  conviction,  punishment  and  eventual

vindication?  Who knows of the persistent struggle by his wife Lucie and

his  brother  Mathieu  to  clear  his  name  and  by  the  band  of  intellectuals

and civil libertarians who came to be convinced of his innocence?  Who

recalls the efforts of military and government leaders and churchmen in

France  to  uphold  his  guilt,  even  when  they  were  presented  with

overpowering  evidence  that  he  had  been  wrongly  convicted?   What

lessons does L'Affaire Dreyfus have for liberty in contemporary Australia

and  for  how  we  handle  complaints  about  the  misuse  of  governmental

power?   Of  prejudice  against  minorities?   Of  miscarriages  of  justice  by

the  very  institutions  that  we  entrust  to  protect  society  and  its  members

from injustice?



In  its  day,  the  Dreyfus  trials  and  their  aftermath  were  like  the

Petrov case, the Lindy Chamberlain saga, the ordeal of David Hicks, the

Mallard  case,  and  the  trial  of  Saddam  Hussein,  all  wrapped  into  one.

Yet  none  of  those  events,  nor  anything  we  have  seen  in  Australia,  is

exactly like the ordeal to which Alfred Dreyfus was subjected.  In its time,

that  ordeal  became  an  illustration  of  how  human  institutions  can  go

wrong,  human  justice  can  fail  and  pride  and  patriotism  can  swamp

concern  for  the  individual.   All  too  easily,  this  can  happen  when  that

individual  is  a  member  of  a  minority  subjected  to  irrational  hatred  -  as

Dreyfus,  the  Jew,  was  and  as  others  in  the  century  that  followed  have

been.



The  Dreyfus  case  was  a  warning  of  the  Holocaust,  of  the  show

trials  of  Hitler,  Stalin  and  Pol  Pot,  and  of  the  occasional  failings  of

elected  democracies  that  marked  the  twentieth  century.   It  was  a

3.

warning that was not sufficiently recognised a century ago.  We do well

to reflect on it today so that we do not repeat its mistakes.



There  are  few  in  Australia  today  who  remember  the  details  of

Dreyfus's case.  We know vaguely of the long controversy that divided

France,  of  his  banishment  to  Devil's  Island,  of  the  brave  band  of

supporters  who  never  lost  faith  in  his  innocence,  of  the  anti-semitism

that played a part in his conviction and of the long time it took to clear his

name.  But we do not know the details.



It  is  in  the  detail  that  the  wrongs  of  the  Dreyfus  affair  are  to  be

found.  The greatest wrong was not the mistaken conviction of Dreyfus

for  treason.   Human  justice  makes  human  errors.   No  human  effort  is

immune from error2.  What was important was how the conviction came

about  in  the  first  place;  how  it  was  reconfirmed  in  the  face  of

overwhelming  evidence;  and  how  ultimately  institutions  of  government

and other powerful forces elevated the insistence on Dreyfus' conviction

above the proof of his innocence.  Maintaining his guilt became a badge

of honour for elements in the army, the Church, the government and the

population  at  large.   Even  today  in  France,  streets  and  statues  that

honour Dreyfus are desecrated.  In France, murders still happen that are

attributed to anti-semitism3.  Closer to home, violence against ethnic and

religious  minorities  shocks  Australians  who  are  convinced  that  the

national  acceptance  of  multicultural  ideals  will  spare  Australia  from  the

worst of such prejudice.



So come back a hundred years to when the Dreyfus affair was still

on  the  lips  of  most  informed  people,  even  in  Australia4.   How  did  it

happen?   Why  should  contemporary  Australians  give  any  thought  to

events that occurred so long ago and so far away?



Sources of anti-semitism: To find the answers to these questions it

is necessary to dig deep into an infantile tendency of human beings.  A

root cause of the Dreyfus affair was anti-semitism.  A fear and hatred of

Jews  in  France  arose  because  of  several  factors:   their  minority

numbers; their exclusive, counter-majoritarian, habits; their involvement

in money lending and finance; their often unusual clothing; their distinct

culinary  habits;  and  their  disproportionate  educational  and  professional

success.  Above all, there was the supposed "blood guilt" of Jews for the

death of Jesus Christ.  The foundation for this blood guilt was a passage

Affair"  in  (1994)  12  Journal  of  Australian  Jewish  Historical  Society   467 at 467-468.

in  St  Matthew's  Gospel,  when  Pontius  Pilate,  the  Roman  Governor  of

Judea,  offered  to  release  Jesus  but  the  Jewish  people  of  Jerusalem

chose Barrabas and said to Pilate, of Jesus, "His blood be on us, and on

our children"5.  On those nine words was hung a terrible hatred.



The hatred was reinforced, until recent times, by prayers in church

services  at  Easter  for  the  conversion  of  "the  perfidious  Jews";  by  deep

feelings  of  animosity  towards  the  Jews  amongst  many  Christians  and

others;  and  by  governmental,  political  and  church  attitudes  that  fuelled

anti-semitism throughout Europe and beyond.



Revolutionary and military causes:  It was a mark of the embrace

of notions of universalism and rationality after the French Revolution that

they eventually gave rise to an edict of liberation for the Jews of France.

Although  prejudice  endured,  it  waned  in  nineteenth  century  France.

Gradually,  notions  of  secularism,  reserving  religion  to  a  private  zone,

began to prevail.  This was a feature of France in the Belle Epoch that

reassured  Dreyfus  that  he  would  be  protected  by  the  French  legal

system against any lingering attitudes of prejudice against Jews.  After

all,  decades  earlier,  Christian  symbols  had  been  removed  from  French

courthouses.  The French Declaration on the Rights of Man and of the

Citizen drew no distinctions on the grounds of race or religion.  At first,

Dreyfus's confidence was to prove misplaced.



The seeds of the affair were planted by the military humiliation of

France  in  the  Franco-Prussian  War  of  1870.   The  defeat  of  the  army,

that  still  boasted  of  the  Napoleonic  conquest  of  Europe,  was  a  great

blow to French honour and pride.  The defeat was commonly attributed

to  German  spies.   Only  spying,  it  was  believed,  could  explain  the

collapse  of  an  army  and  nation  so  historical,  glorious  and  unique.

Paranoia over superior German spying capacity was never far from the

surface  in  the  last  years  of  the  nineteenth  century.   Financial  collapse,

economic  depression  and  the  political  instability  of  the  Third  Republic

turned conservative politicians and newspapers into messengers of fear

and suspicion of the supposed enemies of the nation in its midst.  The

loss  of  Alsace  and  Lorraine  made  those  who  stayed  behind  in  France

suspect  in  the  eyes  of  some  fellow  citizens  and  the  newspapers  that

pandered  to  their  fears.   This  was  especially  so  if  they  were  German-speaking,  with  German-sounding  names.   It was particularly so if they

were of the Jewish minority.



Discovery  of  the  bordereau:   Into  this  potent  mix  of  fear  and

suspicion  intruded  a  remarkable  event6.   A  document  was  discovered,

probably  by  a  French  concierge  working  at  the  Germany  embassy  in

Paris.  It was handed to French security who then worked in a section of

the  General  Staff  of the  army.  Torn  into  six  pieces,  this  memorandum

(bordereau)  was  a  communication  in  French  with  a  German  contact

about miliary secrets, including details about a new French field gun.  It

was signed with the initial "D".  It suggested that a senior military official

of France was providing secrets to the German military attachÃÂ© in Paris.



The  bordereau  led  immediately  to  a  search  for  the  culprit.   That

search  led  the  senior  members  of  the  French  army  to  suspect  Alfred

Dreyfus.  He was descended from a wealthy Jewish family from Alsace.

He had made the French army his career.  He was a non-observant Jew

who enjoyed an income many times greater than his military salary.  He

had been a top student.  At the age of thirty, his outstanding service led

him to be assigned to work in the Ministry of War in Paris, with the rank

of  captain.   For  a  soldier,  he  lived  an  unusually  quiet  family  life.    His

misfortune  was  that  the  leaders  of  the  General  Staff  were  openly  anti-semitic.   They  were  determined,  without  delay,  to  rid  the  army  of  the

author of the inculpating document.



The  bordereau was  discovered  in  late  September  1894.   By  late

October  1894,  the  intensely  conservative  and  right-wing  Christian

newspaper, La  Libre  Parole, was  fed  the  news  that  the  suspect  in  the

spying was a Jewish officer.  Dreyfus had been asked, on a pretext, to

write  a  letter  based  on  the  wording  of  the  bordereau.   Because  of

perceived similarities between the handwriting in the two documents, he

was arrested and imprisoned.  The Dreyfus affair had begun.

8.



Conviction and exile: In December 1894 Dreyfus was put on trial

before a court martial.  He had an excellent lawyer who was convinced

of the innocence of his client and demanded an open trial.  However, the

military judges insisted on a trial held in closed court.  They said that this

was essential to preserve national security.  Handwriting experts called

by the army attested to the similarity of the writing in the bordereau and

Dreyfus's writing.  However, two superior experts called for the defence

pointed to many dissimilarities.  Dreyfus' lawyer was sure that his client

would be free at the end of the trial.



As is now known, contrary to procedural fairness and the French

law  governing  courts  martial,  an  officer  of  the  War  Ministry  provided  a

secret  dossier  to  the  members  of  the  court  martial  whilst  it  was

deliberating.   The  dossier  contained  a  letter  from  an  Italian  military

attachÃÂ© inculpating Dreyfus.  Neither Dreyfus nor his lawyer were given

access to this secret evidence.  Nor did they know of its provision.  The

course  adopted  was  later  justified  in  the  name  of  national  security7.

Vehemently  professing  his  innocence,  Dreyfus  was  unanimously

convicted  of  treason.   He  was  condemned  to  military  degradation  and

perpetual deportation.

9.

In  an  electric  scene  in  the  courtyard  of  the  Ecole  Militaire  in  the

centre  of  Paris,  Dreyfus  had  his  military  insignia  torn  from  his  uniform

and  his  sword  broken  in  his  presence.   A  famous  cartoon  of  the  time

showed  him  bowed  and  humiliated.   But  photography  had  arrived  by

1894.  A photograph showed him unbowed and erect.  He declared in a

voice that those nearby could hear:  "I forbid you to do this to me".  And

because the square was so large, Dreyfus was led around its perimeter

to be humiliated in front of the assembled army officers and antagonistic

citizens.   He  was  far  from  bowed.   Repeatedly  he  declared  "Innocent!

Innocent!  Vive la France!".  It was an unsettling response that led many

who witnessed it to quit the assembly in a state of disquiet.



But  disquiet  was  not  present  in  the  vast  majority  of  witnesses.

Dreyfus's protestations were drowned out by cries "Death to the Jew!".

In the legislature, politicians of all persuasions welcomed the outcome of

the court martial and the eradication of a blemish on the honour of the

French army.  Uncovering so swiftly the treasonous spy was a cause for

congratulations  to  the  government  and  the  army.   Even  the  radical

politician,  Georges  ClemenÃÂ§eau,  who  was  later  to  become  a  supporter

of  Dreyfus,  asked  Parliament  why  an  ordinary  soldier  would  be

condemned  to  death  for  treason  but  a  captain  spared  of  his  life?

Politicians  of  the  right,  the  left  and  of  the  centre,  jumped  on  the

bandwagon  of  excoriation.   Dreyfus  was  exiled  to  Devil's  Island  off  the

coast of French Guyana, as soon as his petition for appeal was rejected.

On that island, he spent his time in solitary confinement in a malarious

10.

environment.  However, his spirit was not broken, nor that of his wife and

brother.



A  saga  of  iniquity  began  that  represents  the  essence  of  the

Dreyfus affair.  The army had wanted no publicity and a quick conclusion

to  the  matter.   However,  no  motive  had  been  shown  why  a  wealthy

captain,  with  a  promising  career,  would  have  acted  as  claimed.   The

motive  hinted  at  was  Dreyfus's  origin  in  Alsace,  his  knowledge  of  the

German  language  and  his  Jewishness.   Religious  newspapers  like  La

Libre  Parole  and  La  Croix  supported  the  conviction  whenever  it  was

questioned.   As  the  growing  evidence  of  wrongdoing  mounted,  these

forces  in  government,  in  the  army  and  the  Church  railed  against  the

questioners.  For them, patriotism demanded unquestioning loyalty.  But

the questioners would not let up.



A second letter is discovered:  The case against Dreyfus began to

collapse  in  March  1896  when  another  letter  was  intercepted  in  the

German embassy.  This could not have involved Dreyfus, safely locked

away on Devil's Island.  Because a new government had taken office in

Paris,  the  Dreyfus  file  was  reopened.   A  military  official,  Georges

Picquart became convinced, against his earlier belief, of the innocence

of  Dreyfus  and  of  the  guilt  of  another  army  officer,  Major  Ferdinand

Walsin-Esterhazy.   Esterhazy,  a  big  spending  soldier,  originally  from

Hungary,  with  a  weakness  for  women  and  gambling,  was  identified  by

his stockbroker, de Castro, who saw a photographic reproduction of the

11.

incriminating bordereau in  a  newspaper.   It  had  been  published  to

confirm Dreyfus's guilt. Instead, it shifted a spotlight onto Esterhazy.



Esterhazy  demanded  a  court  martial  to  clear  his  name.   In  the

heated  atmosphere  of  the  times,  the  army  pulled  out  all  the  stops  to

reaffirm the guilt of Dreyfus and to clear Esterhazy.  False rumours had

been  circulated  that,  before  departing  France,  Dreyfus  had  confessed

his guilt to miliary colleagues.  In the face of his astonishing performance

at  the  Ecole  Militaire,  this  proved  unconvincing.   A  leak  from  military

headquarters to a sympathetic newspaper contained a mention, for the

first time, of the existence of the incriminating secret file provided to the

court martial in 1894.  This unintended slip propelled the Dreyfus family

to petition the Chamber of Deputies for review.  Picquart was transferred

to a dangerous post in Tunisia, presumably in the hope that he would die

or  disappear.   He  did  not  oblige.   Another  conservative  newspaper,

unsympathetic to Dreyfus, Le Matin boastingly published the bordereau

as  evidence  of  Dreyfus's  guilt  and  de  Castro  saw  it.   But  the  biggest

mistake that then occurred was the interference by military operatives in

the evidence that had been used to convict Dreyfus.



Forged  messages  were  inserted  in  the  military  file,  naming

Dreyfus as the spy.  Eventually these forgeries were revealed as such.

One  of  them,  prepared  by  a  master  forger,  came  undone  when

examination  under  magnification  showed  a  discrepancy  between  the

size  and  colour  of  the  lines  in  the  paper  at  different  parts  of  the

reconstructed  page.  The  identification  of  Dreyfus's  name  appeared  on

12.

paper  that  had  obviously  been  skilfully  inserted  in  the  original  that  had

contained  no  such  identification.   It  was  like  a  modern  case  of

reconstruction by photocopying.  It showed the extent to which the army

would go to keep the Dreyfus case closed.



ÃÂmile Zola's accusation:  Unsurprisingly, Esterhazy was acquitted

by his court martial.  Lucie Dreyfus's petition was rejected by the French

legislature.   At  the  end  of  1897,  the  French  Prime  Minister  declared  to

the  National  Assembly  "There  is  no  Dreyfus  affair  whatsoever".

However, by this time, a group of civil libertarians and intellectuals had

taken up the Dreyfus cause8.



ÃÂmile  Zola  published the first of a series of public letters urging his

fellow  citizens  to  interest  themselves  in  the  wrongful  conviction  of

Dreyfus.   International  handwriting  experts  denounced  the  opinion  that

Dreyfus  was  the  author  of  the  bordereau.   Zola  stepped  up  his  public

campaign.  On 13 January 1898, in ClemenÃÂ§eau's newspaper L'Aurore,

Zola wrote a letter to the President of the French Republic.  It appeared

under  a  full-page  headline,  composed  by  ClemenÃÂ§eau,  "J'accuse …!".

Writers  of great  distinction,  such  as  Marcel  Proust and  Anatole  France

joined  the  campaign.   But  anti-semitic  hoodlums  took  to  the  streets  to

defend France against "Masons, Protestants and Jews".

13.

By February 1898, the French League for Human and Civic Rights

was founded to provide a focus for the voices asserting that the Dreyfus

conviction  was  a  miscarriage  of  justice.   Contemporaneous  with  these

developments  was  a  heightened  resolve  by  officials  to  affirm  Dreyfus's

conviction  and  to  keep  his  file  firmly  closed.   Their  resolve  was

evidenced by the outcome of Zola's letter.  Instead of the reopening the

Dreyfus case, it resulted in a long prosecution of Zola for criminal libel.

He was convicted and, after appeal, retried and reconvicted.  He fled to

Switzerland  and  then  to  England  where he awaited the outcome of his

campaign.  He was denounced personally and, not content with this, his

critics also traduced his father.



Yet  by  August  1898  senior  army  officers  were  also  beginning  to

share some of the doubts about the forged materials discovered in the

army files.  They moved to dismiss  Esterhazy  from  the  army.   His

dismissal was not for treason, but for "habitual misconduct".  Even in the

face  of  plain  forgeries,  the  army  continued  to  cover  up.   Indeed,  an

inquiry  was  initiated  against  Picquart,  working  for  a  reopening  of  the

Dreyfus  case  from  within  the  army.   He  was  arrested  and  imprisoned.

Still more violent anti-semitic demonstrations broke out in Paris.  Mobs

took to the streets to assert the guilt of Dreyfus and to condemn the lack

of patriotism of those who questioned it.  Evidence was not the concern

of these people.  Fear of German spies and of Jewish aliens was what

drove them.  By December 1898, in response to the League for Human

and  Civil  Rights  conservative  forces  founded  the  League  of  French

Patriots.  It was to survive the outcome of the Dreyfus case and to laud

14.

the 'patriotic' officers who had forged documents in order to uphold the

army's honour.  Eventually, this body was to provide the personnel who

initiated  the  anti-semitic campaigns  of Vichy France  during  the  Second

World War.



Second trial and its outcome:  All of this notwithstanding, by 1899,

despite  the  passions  and  the  cover-up,  it  had  become  impossible  to

keep the lid on the errors of the Dreyfus trial.  A Court of Appeal in June

1899,  overturned  the  court  martial  verdict  of  1894.   Dreyfus  was

summoned back to France for a new court martial.  He was remanded in

custody at Rennes.  Foreign journalists noticed that, in the second court

martial, conducted in a local high school, Christian symbols remained on

the  walls,  as  if  to  indicate  that  in  miliary  affairs,  secularism  would  not

intrude too far.  In August 1899, a fanatic shot at Dreyfus's lawyer in an

attempt to kill him.  But the second trial proceeded a week later.  To the

astonishment of foreign observers, Dreyfus was not acquitted but for the

second time, this time by majority, he was found guilty of treason.  The

verdict  was  qualified  by  a  rider  of  "extenuating  circumstances".

Dreyfus's imprisonment was reduced to ten years detention9.



The outcry against this verdict was enormous and instantaneous.

Within days the French Cabinet had recommended that Dreyfus should

be  pardoned  by  the  President.   Dreyfus  only  accepted  the  pardon  on



9   See  Burns,  above  n  1,  176  describing  the  Rennes  verdict  and  its   immediate annulment.

15.

condition that he could continue to assert and prove his innocence.  The

President agreed to this stipulation.  The pardon issued.  The Minister of

War  declared:   "The  incident  is  over"10.   Paris  was  preparing  for  the

inauguration  of  the  Universal  Exhibition  of  1900.   The  Chamber  of

Deputies  passed  an  amnesty  law.   Many  hoped  that  Alfred  Dreyfus

would quietly disappear into old age.  But the turmoil was not so easily

put to rest.



Vindication  and  innocence:   Many  members  of  the  Chamber  of

Deputies were gravely disquieted by the official conduct during the affair.

This  disquiet  grew  when  the  army  itself,  in  October  1903,  raised  the

possibility  of  a  further  retrial  of  Dreyfus.   In  March  1904,  the  Criminal

Chamber  of  the  Court  of  Cassation  granted  Dreyfus's  request  for  a

reinvestigation  of  his  case.   That  investigation  concluded  with  an

outcome  favourable  to  Dreyfus.   The  decision  was  referred  to  an

extraordinary sitting of the Supreme Court of Appeal in November 2004.

On 12 July 1906, after still further inquiry, the Supreme Court of Appeal,

with all three Chambers of France's highest court sitting jointly, annulled

the Rennes verdict.  It pronounced the total rehabilitation of Dreyfus.  It

proclaimed  his  innocence.   A  week  later  in  the  same  courtyard  of  the

Ecole Militaire in Paris, Dreyfus was decorated a Knight of the Legion of

Honour.  When the crowd shouted "Long live Dreyfus!", he replied in the



10   J D Bredin, The Affair:  The Case of Alfred Dreyfus (1986); A David,  Famous Political Trials (Learner, 1980) at 45.

16.

words  he  had  used  in  that  place  twelve  years  earlier:   "Vive  la

France!"11.  Picquart was there t witness the scene.



The Vichy aftermath:  Some observers declared that the ultimate

outcome  of  the  Dreyfus  affair  was  a  delayed  vindication  of  French

institutions and a reaffirmation of civic equality in the face of stigma and

discrimination.  Yet the legacy of the case was a deep sense of disquiet

both by supporters and opponents of Dreyfus.  His supporters noted the

long  interval  of  denial,  forgery  and  cover-up  to  which,  even  in  a

democratic  country  like  France,  great  governmental  institutions  would

stoop.   His  opponents  continued  to  hate  those  who  had  supported

Dreyfus.   They  considered  that  their  damaging  campaign  had

questioned the honour of the French army and the nobility of the nation:

values that were to be maintained at all costs - even, if necessary, at the

sacrifice of a person like Dreyfus.  Some of the anti-Dreyfusards would

never believe his innocence.  A number of them took their vengeance in

the anti-semitic laws of Vichy France.  After 1942, that regime tightened

the  noose  around  the  lives  of  the  Jewish  refugees  in  France  and,

ultimately, even French citizens of Jewish origin.



On the perimeter wall of one corner of the Ecole Militaire in Paris,

where the beginning and the end of the Dreyfus drama was played out,

is a memorial.  It records a group of French Jews ordered to assemble

there, who were deported to the Nazi death camps with almost total loss

of life and true loss of national honour.  Anti-semitism did not die out in

France with the rehabilitation of Alfred Dreyfus.  It lay in wait for further

victims.



What are the lessons for today that we should derive in Australia,

as we reflect on the story of Alfred Dreyfus in France a century ago?



TEN LESSONS FOR TODAY



Vigilance  against  miscarriages:   The  first  lesson  is  that  we  must

be  vigilant  against  miscarriages  of  justice.   It  is  easy  for  the  mind,

especially  the  lawyer's  mind,  to  slip  into  formalism.   Easy  to  forget  the

ultimate purpose of law and of its institutions:  to do justice according to

law.   The  fact  that  a  trial  has  gone  through  all  the  correct  procedures

does not relieve us of the duty to consider any flaws that are alleged in

the process or the outcome that amount to a miscarriage of justice.



Human  justice  is  imperfect.   Most  serious  injustices  happen  long

before cases come before courts.  If police investigation is defective or

partisan, justice may never be rescued.  If the prosecutor does not act

fairly,  the  accusation  may  never  be  properly  tested.   If  officials  lie  and

falsely claim (as in the Dreyfus case) that confessions have been made,

18.

great  wrongs  can  follow12.   This  is  why  the  High  Court  of  Australia

ultimately  insisted  on  verification  of  confessions  to  officials,  leading

Parliaments  throughout  the  country  to  provide  for  sound  and  video

recording  of  them13.   Vulnerable  and  inexperienced  witnesses  can

undermine their own cases14.  In such instances, it is not enough for a

court to admit to lingering "anxiety"15.  This was what the High Court did

at the beginning and end of its reasons dismissing the appeal of Rupert

Max  Stuart,  an  Aboriginal  accused  of,  and  sentenced  to,  death  for  the

murder  of  a  young  girl  based  on  a  flawed  confession16.   In  the  end,  it

was a media campaign, the agitation of civil libertarians and the disquiet

of some politicians that saved Mr Stuart's life - not the Australian courts

of justice.



More  recently,  there  have  been  other  instances  of  suggested

miscarriage  of  justice  where  the  courts  have  been  divided.   The  Lindy

Chamberlain case is an instance17.  The eventual outcome of that saga

was  also  secured  outside  the  courts.   Ultimately,  it  followed  a  Royal

Commission.  Yet more recent examples show the increased vigilance of

Australian  courts  against  the  risks  of  miscarriage.   This  is  usually  the

central issue in most criminal appeals18.



In  the  Mallard  case19,  the  importance  of  the  fair  conduct  of  the

prosecution was given fresh emphasis by the High Court.  In our system

of  law,  the  prosecutor  for  the  Crown  is  not  just  another  litigant,

determined to win its case.  Like the court itself, the prosecutor is subject

to duties of fair conduct, which includes fairness to the accused.  This is

a universal feature of a just system of criminal procedure20.  We are not

exempt from it.  Yet the Mallard case had earlier come to the High Court

and been refused leave to appeal21.  I was a party to that refusal.  It was

only  when  further  evidence  was  accumulated  and  analysed  by

supporters who believed in Mr Mallard's innocence, that the matter was

returned to the courts on a petition of mercy, reopened, re-explored and

found wanting.

The lesson of the Dreyfus case, and of countless cases since, is

that  decision-makers  who  have  control  over  important  decisions  on

behalf of society, must always preserve an open mind.  They must never

join a popular bandwagon.  Society must reserve to itself a questioning

attitude  towards  officialdom.   The  supporters  of  Dreyfus  elevated  the

"duty  to  question"  over  the  "duty  to  obey"22.   Some  patriots  and

institutional conservatives at the time resented this.  But in the end, the

questioners were proved right.



Alert to stigmatised minorities:  The second lesson of the Dreyfus

case  is  that  we  should  be  alert  to  the  dangers  of  prejudice  towards

stigmatised minorities.



There is no doubt that Dreyfus suffered - and was kept on Devil's

Island  long  after  the  gravest  doubts  of  his  guilt  were  demonstrated  -

because he was a member of such a minority.  A Jew in a society with

widespread  and  latent  anti-semitism.   There  are  other  such  minorities,

including  in  Australia.   The  Aboriginals,  like  Stuart.   The  communists.

Arabs  and  Muslims.   A  minority  I  know  well,  of  roughly  the  same

proportion as the Jews:  the homosexual minority, still hated, feared and

discriminated  against,  often  at  the  behest  of  the  same  religious  people



22   Burns, above n 1, viii.

21.

who hated the Jews.  Convicted prisoners, the mentally disabled and the

unconventional are also easy to target.



The lesson of the Dreyfus affair is that we must be on our guard

that  prejudices  do  not  affect  official  decision-making.   The  objective

evidence  against  Dreyfus  was  extremely  weak.   There  was  no  motive,

simply contested handwriting evidence.  What made up the evidentiary

deficit was anti-semitism.  In Australia, we must make sure that we never

make up any evidentiary deficit in a case with attitudes of fear or loathing

against members of a minority.  Everyone in Australia is equal before the

law.  Attitudes of prejudice sometimes exist on the streets.  They have

no  place  in  a  court  of  law  or  other  independent  tribunal.   These

institutions do not answer to populism or mob rule.  The commitment to

equality  before  the  law  is  tested  by  the  way  we  treat  vulnerable

minorities.   Members  of  the  great  majority  do  not  generally  face  this

problem.



Beware  of  military  tribunals:   Dreyfus  was  twice  convicted  by  a

military  tribunal.   The  first  conviction  was  reached  on  the  flimsiest

evidence.  The second occurred in the face of demonstrable proof of his

innocence.  Loyalty to the army swamped the evidence.  One member of

the  first  court  martial  admitted  that  he  had  scarcely  looked  at  the

handwriting tendered to secure the conviction.  Accusation by the most

senior officials of the nation was enough to prove the accusation.



22.

Loyalty, love of nation and belief in its institutions are marvellous

things.  In the modern world, patriotism has its place, at least in sporting

contests.   But  there  is  a  danger  of  tribunals  that  operate  outside  the

independent  courts  deciding  questions  of  liberty.   It  is  why  the

independence of the courts, and the tenure of the judges, is so important

for our freedoms.



An  examination  of  outcomes  in  the  Australian  Refugee  Review

Tribunal, after members were not regularly reappointed, shows a fall-off

in decisions favourable to applicants for refugee status23.  This is what

can happen where decision-makers do not enjoy guaranteed tenure.  It

is true that such guarantees sometimes entail disadvantages and cloak

individual inadequacies.  But over the centuries, judicial tenure has been

a great protection for our liberties.  It did not exist in the first or second

tribunals that tried and convicted Dreyfus.  Those military tribunals were

not really independent.  They evinced loyalty for their conception of the

nation  and  for  their  military  superiors.   An  affirmation  of  civilian  rule  is

crucial  to  the  just  trial  of  serious  accusations.   It  is  ironic  to  read  the

American comments on the Dreyfus trials in the 1890s and the asserted

superiority of American civil courts24, contrasting them with the defence

of military commissions today.

In  Australia,  courts  martial  are  an  exception  to  the  general

principle  of  civilian  courts  for  contested  federal  accusations25.   In  this,

Australian  law  normally  reflects  a  longstanding  British  tradition  that

restrict  courts  martial,  essentially  to  military  accusations  arising  out  of

conduct on the battlefield26.  A recent High Court decision has had the

effect  of  expanding  this  exceptional  military  jurisdiction.   It  was  my

opinion in that case, and still is, that the present is not a good time to be

expanding the jurisdiction and powers of military tribunals27.  Doing so is

contrary to our constitutional history and, in my view, to the constitutional

text.



Anyone  in  doubt  about  the  defects  that  can  intrude  in  military

tribunals in fraught circumstances should read about the Dreyfus case,

and  especially  about  the  second  outcome  at  Rennes.   They  provide  a

reason  for  deep  concern,  mentioned  by  many  observers,  about  the

proposed  military  commissions  in  the  United  States  for  trying  the



of the civil over the military power, and to purge themselves of the  rank  corruption  and  gross  injustice  which  fester  in  the  Dreyfus   case".  25

prisoners kept for four years in the military base at Guantanamo Bay28.

The subordination of the military power to the civilian power is one of the

key  elements  in  a  successful  modern  democracy.   We  must  keep  it

unimpaired in contemporary Australia.



Beware of secret trials:  The Dreyfus case also teaches the great

care  that  must  be  observed  in  deciding  serious  accusations  behind

closed  doors.   The  giving  of  decisions  in  secret,  based  on  secret

evidence not made available to an accused or the public, was a serious

flaw in Dreyfus's first trial.  It was only repaired when, later, mistakenly

hoping that it would condemn Dreyfus, a photograph of the document on

which he was convicted, the bordereau, was published by a newspaper

aiming to satisfy its readers of his guilt.



A feature of our legal system, inherited from Britain, is a revulsion

against  secret  trials29.   Even  where  there  is  confidential  information,

courts  must  ordinarily  be  trusted  to  adopt  expedients  to  keep  the  trial,

and the evidence, open whilst treating with sensitivity particular material

recognised as sensitive.  The light of public scrutiny must be shone on

all  serious  trials.   Otherwise,  they  may  become  a  cosy  self-fulfilling

enterprise denying fundamental rights to the accused.



The  fact  that  national  security  was  repeatedly  asserted  as  the

reason  for  the  secrecy  of  the  Dreyfus  trial  should  make  us  cautious

about that claim.  But for the gradual emergence of the truth, the army

and  many  other  powerful  interests  in  France,  would  have  closed  the

Dreyfus  case.   Gradually,  most  people  would  have  forgotten  him.   He

would have rotted away on Devil's Island.  Politicians of all persuasions,

and  the  demonstrators  on  the  streets,  would  have  continued  to

denounce Dreyfus as a traitor.  It was only a band of supporters, and the

gradual emergence of the truth, that saved this innocent man from that

fate.   That  was  not  the  outcome  of  the  closed  and  secret  trial  which

officialdom wanted.



Protection  for  people  of  conscience:   The  Dreyfus  case  also

demonstrates  the  importance  of  protecting  and  honouring  people  of

conscience.  Protests might have been expected from Dreyfus's wife and

brother:   declaring  his  innocence  and  working  for  his  vindication.

Families are like this.  But they often cling to ideas of innocence in the

face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  The community tends to

discount  family  claims,  as  the  French  community  originally  did  in  the

case of the Dreyfus family's pleas.



What changed the outcome of the Dreyfus case was the gradual

adherence  of  intellectuals  and  civil  libertarians  to  the  Dreyfus  side.   In

26.

Australia,  we  do  not  much  like  the  notion  of  intellectuals.   They  are

called "egg-heads".  They often fall, as the first victims, to the tall poppy

syndrome  that  has  existed  in  Australia  since  the  earliest  convict  days.

Further,  there  are  people  in  our  own  society  who  condemn  civil

libertarians  and  reject  their  role.   On  some  occasions,  it  is  true,  civil

libertarians  buck  the  system  and  challenge  authority  with  its  important

tasks  to  perform.   Yet,  it  was  the  Dreyfus  case  that  led  to  the

establishment  in  1898  of  the  French  League  for  Human  and  Civic

Rights,  the  equivalent  of  the  Australian  Councils  for  Civil  Liberties.

Writers and philosophers and journalists and lawyers joined the League.

It  focussed  the  disquiet  about  the  Dreyfus  conviction.   It  mobilised  the

belief that a wrong should be righted.



A  British  admiral  who  brought  his  nuclear  warship  into  Sydney

Harbour  had  to  combat  Australian  protestors,  one  of  whom  tried  to

clamber  on  board.   Far  from  joining  the  local  denunciations  of  the

protestors,  voiced  by  embarrassed  local  authorities,  the  admiral

defended their right to protest and to object.  He said, indeed, that this

was the ultimate role of the defence forces:  to protect a free society in

which  people  could  protest.   As  Justice  Murphy  once  put  it,  the  world

has  been  greatly  improved  by  protestors  objecting  to  injustice  as  they

saw  it.   Sometimes  they  have  brought  the  world  round  to  their

persuasion.   Mr  Neal,  he  famously  declared,  was  "entitled  to  be  an

agitator"30.

It  is  necessary  to  acknowledge  that,  eventually,  some  of  the

crucial converts to the Dreyfus cause were officers of the French army.

Georges Picquart became convinced that Dreyfus had been framed.  He

paid for his conviction, and the disclosure of the reasons for his anxiety,

by being arrested, court martialled and imprisoned.  Fortunately, he lived

to see the vindication of his suspicions.  He was present when Dreyfus

was welcomed back to the Ecole Militaire in 1906.  Yet when he acted

as he did, he could not have known the outcome.



Some whistle-blowers are obsessive, misguided, intolerant people

who  will  never  accept  overwhelming  evidence.   But,  as  Commandant

Picquart  illustrates,  some  are  vital  agents  for  truth.   Where  it  is

important,  and  a  person  is  suffering  loss  of  liberty  and  honour,  society

must protect conscientious officials and others who adhere to truth, even

if sometimes they prove wrong and misguided.



Picquart was not alone.  A decade after Dreyfus's conviction and

following  his  pardon,  more  senior  army  officers  began  to  have,  and  to

express, doubts.  True, the army leadership was complicit in the cover-up. Most of its leaders never accepted Dreyfus's innocence.  But there

were military people and officials of conscience and integrity who were

eventually won round.  Sadly, it took a very long time.



Scrutiny of authority:  The story of the Dreyfus affair is one about

spies.   Acting  on  partial  information,  embracing  a  theory,  defending

28.

national  security  and  honour  as  they  saw  it,  their  "intelligence"  and

"proof" took a great democratic republic, France, down the road where it

seemed  willing  to  sacrifice  an  individual  to  defend  the  honour  of  the

nation and its army.



The  cover-up  was  remarkable.   When  a  military  officer  prepared

the forged documents, and slipped them into the military file, he thought

his ploy would never be discovered.  It would help prove what he knew,

in any case, was the truth.  But the forgery was discovered.  When this

perfidy  was  revealed,  the  army  officer  committed  suicide.   Yet

immediately,  he  was  praised  for  his  "honourable"  actions.  They  were

excused as patriotic.  A national collection was invited for the support of

his widow31.



People  exist  who  are  so  blinded  by  their  concept  of  duty  and

patriotism  and  distorted  by  their  participation  in  espionage,  that  they

forget  society's  commitment  to  truth  and  justice.   A  civil  society,

respecting liberty, must always be on its defensive against such honour-blind people.  It must beware of their cover-ups.  It must retain a healthy

scepticism  about  their  accusations  of  anti-State  activity.   The  terrible

wrongs of the Gestapo in Germany, of the NKVD, Stalin's secret police,

of  Pol  Pot's  Khmer  Rouge,  and  even  of  the  Un-American  Activities



31   P Quillard, "The Henry Monument" cited in Burns above n 1, 130.

29.

Committee in the United States show what grave wrongs can be done in

the name of patriotism and national security.



Every  society  has  a  right  and  duty  to  protect  its  citizens  against

genuine  affronts  to  security.   But,  in  the  long  run,  the  best  guarantee

against attacks on society is a steady adherence to the institutions and

ways  of  a  temperate  democracy.   This  steady  adherence  was

demonstrated in Australia in 1951 in the decision of the High Court in the

Communist Party case32.  That decision invalidated the law designed to

outlaw  Australian  communists.   That  case  will  always  stand  in  marked

contrast  to  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States,  at

the  same  time,  upholding  a  similar  law  to  deprive  communists  in  that

country  of  their  rights  to  assembly  and  to  free  speech,  although

expressly guaranteed in the American Constitution33.



Maintenance of secularism:  Another lesson of the Dreyfus case is

the importance of keeping religious beliefs separate from the institutions

of  the  State.   It  is  not  a  coincidence  that,  in  December  1905,  in  the

aftermath  of  the  vindication  by  the  Criminal  Chamber  of  the  Court  of

Cassation of Alfred Dreyfus's appeal, a law was enacted by the French



32   Australian  Communist  Party  v  The  Commonwealth  (1951)  83  CLR   1.

30.

legislature  establishing  clearly  the  separation  of  Church  and  State  in

France34.



France  had  been  moving  in  the  direction  of  secularism  in  the

nineteenth century.  However, the strong support for the forces lined up

against  Dreyfus  by  anti-semitic  elements  in  the  Church,  army  and

politics  of  France,  led  to  a  strong  feeling  of  revulsion  against  these

institutions  when  the  injustice  and  cover-ups  of  the  Dreyfus  case  were

laid bare.  Secularism in France was reinforced.  It is still strong.



A study of Australian Church journals in the years of the Dreyfus

affair shows that they never reflected the antagonistic attitude to Dreyfus

revealed  in  various  Church-supported  newspapers  and  other

publications  in  France35.   Instead,  the  Australian  religious  press  noted

the  suggested  double  standards  of  the  English  media  towards  the

French  trials  and  the  trials  of  the  Irish  and  Boer  accused  in  the  British

Empire.  The strong bias against secret military tribunals, that has long

existed in English-speaking countries, was evident in Australia.



The institutions that grew up supposedly to defend patriotism and

the honour of the army and the nation in the Dreyfus case, were later to

31.

flourish and to spawn the extremist politicians and officials who led the

anti-semitism of the Vichy period of French history.  It was not a noble

time for Christian adherents or for the universal principles of their faith.

But it was a lesson of the need to keep the religious dimension private

and  for  the  State  to  protect  and  defend  equally  all  people  in  its

jurisdiction,  whatever  their  religion,  ethnicity  or  features  of  special

difference.



If  anything,  the  separation  of  religion  and  the  State  has  become

more important and urgent as the decades have passed.  In the modern

age,  insistence  upon  legal  enforcement  of  religious  beliefs  is  again

intruding into law and governance36.  Demands that religious law should

predominate  over  the  laws  made  by  a  civilian  Parliament  need  to  be

resisted  where  they  affect  the  basic  civic  rights  of  others.   We  know,

from  contemporary  experience,  that  sometimes  religious  minorities

target  vulnerable  minorities.   Those  minorities  may  be  Jews.   But  they

may  also  be  gays.   Or  members  of  the  Baha'i  faith.   Islamic  believers.

Or Christians in some countries.  In a modern, democratic and pluralistic

State,  the  law  should  be  there  for  everyone.   People  should  not  be

punished  for  changing  their  religion  or  renouncing  religion  altogether.

These are fundamental individual human rights.



36   See  eg  R  A  Fenton,  "Catholic  doctrine  Versus  Women's  Rights:    The New Italian Law on Assisted Reproduction" (2005) 14 Medical  Law  Review  73  at  75  concerning  recent  polarisation  in  the  Italian

Parliament  over  a  law  on  assisted  reproduction.   There  are  many   examples in many countries on many issues.

32.



Respect for the right to religion and for the dignity of each religion

does  not  extend  to  punishing  people  because  they  are  of  a  different

religion  or  because  of  the  characteristics  attributed  to  that  religion.   I

hope  that  we  have  grown  out  of  sectarian  attitudes  in  Australia.   Such

attitudes,  between  Catholics  and  Protestants  and  against  Jews,  were

still  present  in  the  Australia  of  my  youth.   The  wrongs  of  the  Dreyfus

accusations demonstrated the perils of anti-semitism.



Witnessing  them,  Theodor  Herzl,  reporting  for  the  Viennese

newspaper, Der  Judenstaat,  came  to  the  conviction  that  a  separate

national  homeland  for  the  Jews  was  essential.   If  Jews  could  not  be

protected  effectively  in  their  liberties,  even  in  comparatively  liberal  and

secular France, Herzl believed they were in peril everywhere.  The State

of  Israel  was  thus  an  indirect  outcome  of  the  affront  to  justice  of  the

Dreyfus  affair.   In  all  societies,  lawyers  and  other  citizens  must  build  a

protection  for  religious  minorities.   However,  there  must  equally  be  an

insistence  on  respect,  under  the  law,  for  religious  freedom.   Religious

freedom  includes  the  right  to  change  one's  religion  or  to  renounce

religion  altogether.   The  killing  of  apostates  and  of  gays  or  women  or

other groups on supposed religious grounds has no place in the modern

world.   Respect  for  religious  or  cultural  values  must  not  involve

33.

deprivation  of  the  fundamental  human  rights  of  non-adherents  or

minority adherents37.



Ambivalent  role  of  the  media:   The  media  played  an  ambivalent

role  during  the  Dreyfus  affair.   On  the  one  hand,  in  the  earliest  years,

sections of the media inflamed the anti-semitism so evident in the news

and editorials of the Church-supporting newspapers La Libre Parole and

La  Croix.   These  journals  played  their  part  in  suppressing  the  early

attempts to right the wrong of the Dreyfus conviction. They affirmed his

guilt substantially because of his Jewishness.



On the other hand, the publication in L'Aurore of the famous letter

by ÃÂmile Zola, "J'accuse!" was a turning point in the campaign for justice

for Dreyfus.  Liberal newspapers took up his cause.  So did journalists

from  overseas38.   In  a  sense,  the  case  became  an  early  global

illustration of infotainment.  Part of the media attention arose out of the

genuine concern of journalists and editors, affronted by the cover-up and

injustice.   Others  just  liked  a  good  story.   Not  a  few,  in  Australia  and

England, enjoyed pontificating about the superiority of British justice.





37   See  eg  the  provision  on  this  subject  of  the  UNESCO  Universal  Declaration  on  Cultural  Diversity  of  2  November  2001  and  the   Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights of 19 October

2005  (art  12);  cf  R  Inglehart  and  P  Norris,  "The  True  Clash  of   Civilisations", Foreign Policy, March/April 2003, 63.  38   See eg The Times of London, 23 December 1894 in Burns, above n

1, 46-48.

34.

Ultimately, as Lord Russell of Killowen reported to Queen Victoria

in 1899, the rehabilitation of Dreyfus was "brought about mainly by the

efforts of Frenchmen".  His trial had not occurred in the civil courts of the

land  where  his  conviction  would  much  earlier  have  been  quashed39.

Even  Lord  Russell  felt  obliged  to  acknowledge  that  "with  all  his

grossness and exaggeration, the name of Zola ought not to be omitted".

Where the media failed was in identifying the systemic and deep-seated

problems which the Dreyfus case illustrated.  Amongst these, the issues

of  ultra-patriotism,  the  misuse  of  claims  of  national  security  and  the

ubiquity of anti-semitism were inadequately addressed.



Need for institutional changes:  The need for institutional changes

and  improvements  are  illustrated  by  what  happened  to  Alfred  Dreyfus.

In  a  way,  his  case  sounded  a  warning  against  anti-semitism.

Inadequately  attended,  that  scourge  was  to  produce  unparalleled

suffering fifty years later, including in France.



Thinking  on  the  Dreyfus  case  today,  we  can  conclude  that

improvements  in  society's  institutions  are  needed,  including  sometimes

in  the  attitudes  of  those  officials  who  people  those  institutions.

Minimising the role of military tribunals; resisting secret trials; examining

closely  claims  of  national  security;  protecting  stigmatised  minorities:

upholding  secularism.   All  of  these  are  shown  in  stark  relief  by  what

happened to Alfred Dreyfus.



In  many  countries  the  awful  happenings  of  the  first  half  of  the

twentieth  century,  including  the  Dreyfus  affair,  led  ultimately  to  the

acceptance  after  1945  of  notions  of  legally  enforceable  fundamental

human rights.  In Australia, we have accepted those notions as binding

on the country, in the form of international treaty law.  In some instances,

we  have  also  translated  the  notions  into  enforceable  Australian  law  -

such  as  the  law  on  refugees,  the  law  against  racial  discrimination,

against  sex  discrimination  and  on  other  topics.   But  we  have  still  not

taken the final institutional step of embracing, nationally, an enforceable

Australian charter of fundamental rights.  Even Britain, Canada and New

Zealand, in their different ways, have done so, as has India, South Africa

and,  long  since,  the  United  States.   Of  course,  such  charters  are  no

guarantee against wrongdoing, cover-up and official mistakes.  But they

are  an  institutional  protection  for  what  are  partly  institutional  problems.

At the least, they shore up the values that set society's standards which

need to be given weight when cases like Dreyfus come along.



Proffering apologies for wrongs:  There is one final point.  It is also

illustrated by the Dreyfus affair.



In  France,  there  was  a  persistent  reluctance  of  the  old  anti-Dreyfusards  to  acknowledge  the  wrongs  done  to  Alfred Dreyfus.  They

people would blame everything and everyone except the elements that

36.

they  adored  -  in  the  government,  the  army  and  the  Church  who  had

assailed  Dreyfus  and  played  on  anti-semitic  sentiment  to  keep  him

imprisoned  as  an  embarrassment  who  had  attracted  'unpatriotic'  and

'suspect'  supporters.  That  sentiment  came  to  the  fore  again  in  France

under the Vichy regime from 1940 to 1944.



By 1985, the French government, at its highest level, determined

on  a  corrective.   The  socialist  President,  FranÃÂ§ois  Mitterand,

commissioned a statue of Alfred Dreyfus.  It was presented to the army

for placement in the Ecole Militaire.  The army declined to accept it40.  In

1988 it was placed in a corner of Tuileries Gardens in Paris.  Soon after,

it  was  covered  with  painted  swastikas.   Anti-semitic  profanities  were

marked on Dreyfus's tomb at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris.



On  the  centenary  reflections  on  Dreyfus's  arrest  in  1994,  the

official military history, whilst literally accurate, omitted many details and

ignored  the  crimes  done  by  supposed  'patriots'  in  the  name  of  the

honour of the French army.  The official account, written by Colonel Paul

Gaujac,  declared  that  "Dreyfus's  innocence  is  the  thesis  generally

accepted  by  historians"41.   That  observation  showed  that  some  people

will never admit error.  For them Dreyfus's guilt is still an open question -

an equal hypothesis or an arguable theory.

February 1994 in Burns, above n 1, 189-190.

In 1998, President Jacques Chirac took  a bold and healing step.

A  conservative  politician,  he  commemorated  the  centenary  of  Emile

Zola's public letter "J'accuse…!".  It had been written by Zola as a letter

to  the  President  of  the  French  Republic.   At  last,  a  President  of  the

Republic responded.  He took the occasion to remind his fellow citizens

of  the  "sinister  forces,  intolerance,  injustice"  that  can  "creep  into  the

State's  highest  level".   Half  a  century  after  Vichy,  and  a  century  after

Dreyfus's  ordeal,  it  was  timely  to  make  that  acknowledgment  frankly,

openly and humbly.  It was an acknowledgment of "what ÃÂmile Zola and

Alfred Dreyfus are saying to us across the years"42.



President  Chirac  emphasised  the  suffering  of  Alfred  Dreyfus.  He

also  pointed  out  that  Dreyfus  had  known  how  to  forgive.   He  declared

that  it  is  patriots  of  this  kind,  not  shallow,  prejudiced,  discriminating,

covering-up nationalists, who constitute "the conscience of humanity".  It

is  they  who  teach  their  fellow  citizens  that  love  of  country  includes

rejection of intolerance and hatred43.  Blind patriotism and unquestioning

belief  in  the  nation,  whatever  its  wrongs,  is  not  the  ethos  of  a  modern

civic society.

We in Australia have not condemned a fellow citizen for treason to

an equivalent of Devil's Island or Guantanamo Bay.  Indeed, accusations

of treason are exceedingly rare in this country's history.  But Australians

have  certainly  made  mistakes.   Some  we  have  repaired.   Others  we

have failed to repair.  We have shown discrimination against vulnerable

minorities.   Such  discrimination  still  exists.   It  exists  not  just  in  the

streets.  It  exists  in  the  law,  in  legal  ways  and  in  our  hearts.   We  must

learn to recognise these mistakes and, like President Chirac, where they

are  shown,  to  acknowledge  them,   to  express  regret  for  them  to  learn

from them and to teach the next generation.  That is the way to progress

the journey towards greater human enlightenment.



The  Dreyfus  case  speaks  powerfully  to  Jewish  people

everywhere, including in Australia.  This is especially so because of the

genocide  that  followed.   But  it  also  speaks  clearly  of  wrongs  done  to

Aboriginals,  to  Asian  Australians,  to  Arab  and  Islamic  Australians,  to

gays and other sexual minorities, to women, to the very old and young,

to  the  mentally  and  physically  disabled,  to  prisoners,  refugees  and  to

unconventional people.  We must not  think that these wrongs are over

or  that  a  full  enlightenment  has  arrived.   Dreyfus  belongs  to  Jewish

people.  But he also belongs to all human beings.  Down the years, and

even  down  the  centuries,  his  cry  as  he  was  sent  to  exile  from  the

courtyard of the Ecole Militaire in Paris will ring out as a warning against

miscarriages of justice:
