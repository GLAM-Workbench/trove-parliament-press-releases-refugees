UNHCR welcomes new bridging visa for long-term detainees

UNHCR Regional Representative Mr Neill Wright today welcomed the  announcement of new measures to allow the release of some long-term  immigration detainees into the community.  The move was welcomed in  broader human rights terms, and not just for the benefits it may bring to

persons of UNHCR’s mandated concern.

Mr Wright said the new Removal Pending Bridging Visa was a positive step in  giving the Minister more flexibility to end the long-term detention of people  who, while not recognised as refugees, cannot in the short-term be returned to  their home countries for security or other reasons.

“While UNHCR recognises that people who have had access to a fair a asylum  procedure and have been found not to be refugees can be repatriated, there  are instances where this is not possible often for security reasons, such as the  current situation in Iraq.   UNHCR encourages states to provide some form of  temporary stay until it is safe for people to be returned,” said Wright.

“UNHCR will continue to provide the Australian Government with Country of  Origin Information to allow it to assess conditions in the home countries of  people in immigration detention, and whether or not it is safe for people to be  returned.

“I also welcome the access to important social support benefits the new visa  category will provide, including work rights, Medicare, rent assistance,  education, and trauma counselling,” said Mr Wright.
