E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

PRIME MINISTER:

It’s terrific to be here at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute to be involved with the  opening. This is a very good day for South Australia. It’s a very good day for health and medical research in  our country.

As Health Minister, I was responsible for a doubling of National Health and Medical Research Council  spending. Over the life of the Howard Government, National Health and Medical Research Council  spending quadrupled.

One of the commitments that we have made as an incoming government is to ensure that there are no cuts to  Health and Medical Research Council funding. We want to drive our medical research dollar further by  ensuring that there is less bureaucracy in applications for NH&MRC and ARC grants and of course, we’ve  also committed an additional $200 million to dementia research, $40-odd million to tropical medicine  research at James Cook University in Townsville, and $35 million for juvenile diabetes research.

So, I am confident that we will do the right thing by Australia’s health and medical research community. I  am determined to build on the fine legacy of the Howard Government.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, just on another matter, what do you know, if anything, of bird smuggling on a Hercules  that’s been donated to Indonesia? Do you know anything about that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I’ve had the most cursory of briefings just prior to coming down here now. The matter is under  investigation and obviously those investigations need to be allowed to take their course.

QUESTION:

So, you would…you would confirm there is something that’s happened; that there’s been an interception  done?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I understand there has been an incident. The matter is being investigated and those investigations  should be allowed to take their course.

QUESTION:

Is there a bit of an irony that it involves Indonesia?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I want to build the best possible relationship with Indonesia. Indonesia is our most important  relationship overall. I am determined that it’s going to get stronger and stronger in the months and years  ahead, and look, from time to time Australians do things in Indonesia and it shouldn’t be a complete surprise  that occasionally it’s a two-way street.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, in relation to GrainCorp, has the Treasurer been successfully bullied by the National Party  in making today’s decision?

PRIME MINISTER:

The Treasurer has been the guardian of our national interest today, as always. We are open for business -  and I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that we are open for business. We are open for foreign  investment. It has to be foreign investment that accords with our overall national interest. So far, my  understanding is that the Treasurer has considered some 131 major foreign investment applications and 130  of those have been approved.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, what communication has there been with Washington about that decision, to make sure that  they don’t misinterpret it as a breach of the Free Trade Agreement?

PRIME MINISTER:

This is a decision that is, by law, in the hands of the Treasurer. He’s made it very conscientiously and in  accordance with law.

QUESTION:

And how exactly is this decision in the national interest? How would the takeover been against the national  interest?

PRIME MINISTER:

www.pm.gov.au

Well, it’s very important that we consider all of these applications against a range of criteria - a broad range  of criteria - and looking at it, against those broad criteria, given the fact that there was division in our  community, given the fact that the Foreign Investment Review Board itself was divided on this, the  Treasurer made the decision that he did.

QUESTION:

Do you feel you’ve been fighting, this week in particular, just multiple policy battles on various fronts,  whether it be Gonski, whether it be Indonesia, whether it be GrainCorp? Has it been one of those weeks?

PRIME MINISTER:

I am absolutely honoured to be the Prime Minister of our country but in the end it’s not about me, it is about  our country and a better future for our country and while, inevitably, all sorts of issues come up on a day to  day basis, this government will stay its course and its course is clear: to stop the boats, to get the budget  under control and to repeal the taxes that the former government hit us with, and to build the roads of the  21st Century. Now, the coming fortnight is going to be absolutely critical for our country because the  Parliament will have the opportunity to give our country the best possible Christmas present - to give every  household a $550 a year boost - by passing the carbon tax repeal legislation.

On that point, I want to make it absolutely obvious to the Labor Party what the stakes are here, because how  can Labor accuse the Government of breaking a commitment if it tries to stop us from keeping the most  fundamental commitment of all: the commitment to repeal the carbon tax. How can the Labor Party ever  accuse us of damaging the welfare of Australian families if it is stopping us or trying to stop us from  delivering the greatest benefit of all to Australian families - the repeal of the carbon tax?  So, this is a very important fortnight coming up in the Parliament and I will do everything I humanly can to  honour the pledge that I made to the Australian people to end this toxic tax.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, just back on SAHMRI, there’s a proposal to build a sister SAHMRI next door, which would  house the CSIRO. Can you find money for that, do you think?

PRIME MINISTER:

I have not, to the best of my knowledge, seen an application. Obviously these are tougher fiscal times than  existed when I was the Health Minister, when I was able, quite regularly, to provide substantial support for  health and medical research infrastructure. We do have to get the Budget under control, and the commitment  that I’ve given is that there will be no reductions in medical research funding and as far as we can when the  fiscal circumstances permit, we would like to increase medical research funding.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, the Indonesian police chief has told their Parliament that they will stop detaining asylum  seekers whose destination was Australia. How seriously does the Australian Government take that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, the point I make is that it is illegal to engage in people smuggling ventures in Indonesia. People  smuggling is a serious crime under Indonesian law and I am confident that the cooperation that we have had  in the past we can have again in the future. I’m very confident that we can have that.

QUESTION:

www.pm.gov.au

What is your reaction to Rio Tinto’s decision to mothball the Gove Refinery and the loss of 1,000 jobs?

PRIME MINISTER:

My understanding is that what Rio is likely to announce is a phasing down of production at the refinery.  This is obviously very bad news for the workers there but my understanding is that Rio is hoping to be able  to offer new jobs within the Rio Group to those who are currently employed at Gove but who may not be  employed there in the future. The people who I feel very sorry for are those who have bought homes and  businesses in Gove on the expectation of a very vibrant ongoing continuing economy and who are now in a  very difficult position. I think these are the people who Rio does have a moral debt to, if not, necessarily, a  legal debt.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, just in regards to Qantas, can I ask if Qantas has come to the government with any specific  proposal to help back their debt - either a call for an equity injection or a debt guarantee?

PRIME MINISTER:

No, there has not been at this stage a specific proposal. I want to make a couple of points. First, Qantas is a  great Australian icon and the Government wants to see a strong and continuing Qantas. Second, what we  want to see is a strong and competitive aviation sector here in Australia, and that's obviously what we've got.  There are a range of proposals obviously being debated out there in the community. Let's see where that all  goes, but obviously, we want to see a strong and continuing Qantas.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, do you wish the English cricketers well here at the new Adelaide Oval next week?

PRIME MINISTER:

Obviously, I want to see a good game and based on the results of the first Test we will get a good game and  let's hope the right side wins.

QUESTION:

Prime Minister, just on education funding, Christopher Pyne says the Government doesn’t enter into five or  six year arrangements. Does that apply for things like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, too?

PRIME MINISTER:

We are committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance  Scheme is obviously going to ramp up over a period of years and it will be fully operational in 2018/19. But  we do budget on a four-year basis and we will absolutely keep our commitment made pre-election to  provide the same quantum of funding over the four year period than Labor promised. In fact, we'll do a little  better than that. We'll put $230 million more in to ensure that next year, schools got what Labor promised or  what Labor offered and the really interesting thing is that the shadow Treasurer has come clean and admitted  yes, Labor did rip $1.2 billion out of schools funding just a couple of weeks before the election. Now, that  the shadow Treasurer has come clean and admitted the Labor school funding rip-off, now we can have a  sensible debate about the best way forward.

QUESTION:

5

www.pm.gov.au

Can you guarantee that South Australia will receive as much money as was agreed to by the previous  government?

PRIME MINISTER:

I can guarantee that the money that was agreed to for next year will be fully delivered. In fact, there will be  $230 million more next year from this government than there would have been from the Labor Party had it  won the election. The other thing I can guarantee is that what you will get under the Coalition is a school  funding system that is both national and fair. There won't be first class schoolkids in one state and second  class schoolkids in another state. The system will be national and fair and it will be entirely in accordance  with the commitments that we made prior to the election.

Thank you.
