[Greetings omitted]

PRESENTER:

Are you headed to the Lodge?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look it’s not all about me. It’s about the country and it’s about doing the right thing by our country and  I just think that it’s patently obvious that this new tax it’s not fair, it’s not going to reduce global emissions  and you just can’t trust these guys to get it right.

PRESENTER:

Oh Tony, all I want to know is when you get to the Lodge, can we come?

TONY ABBOTT:

A barbecue?

PRESENTER:

Yep.

TONY ABBOTT:

A barbecue for the Hot Breakfast.

PRESENTER:

Yep and a cricket match.

PRESENTER:

Yeah well, hang on, let’s take a step back because we are being a little facetious here but you are doing what  the Opposition does, you are opposing the policy and that’s all completely understandable but something  that struck me when I watched you on Sunday night and I’m sitting there have my takeaway Chinese is that I  don’t feel that you gave us a really good understanding about how you are going to give us tax cuts plus  fund your climate change direct action which is all well and good but is what your are going to do stack up  because you are under fire today from all the economists. Are we now going to find out that Tony Abbott is  all fluff?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, people will make their own judgments and I am confident that I won’t give them any ground for  coming to that kind of a critical judgement. Look, at the last election, we outlined $50 billion worth of  savings over the forward estimates period. Now that more than pays for the $3.2 billion of our direct action  policy and we will be looking for further savings because, you are right, providing tax cuts without a tax  increase to pay for them isn’t going to be easy but when you think that this is a Government that’s wasted  money hand over foot, the pink batts, the school halls and the National Broadband Network, I think it is  possible to find the savings needed to pay for significant tax cuts without a carbon tax and I absolutely  accept that if come election day people don’t think that I’ve been credible in coming up with an alternative  plan, well, that’s going to be a real problem for me and my team.

PRESENTER:

Now, as the preferred PM, people have got you five points clear of Julia Gillard, is it now effectively your  election to lose?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that it’s always hard to knock off an incumbent, it’s always hard to knock off an incumbent and  every day I’ll be out there working as hard as I possibly can a) to expose the flaws in a bad Government  getting worse and b) to demonstrate that we are a credible alternative, but I don’t think anyone should  underestimate how hard it is to knock off an incumbent and the Labor Party have shown time and time again  that they are the masters of the dark arts of politics and if they can pull some stunt, they will.

PRESENTER:

Does that make you a muggle, Tony?

PRESENTER:

But surely they are on the ropes?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they have got the Midas touch in reverse. Everything this Prime Minister has tried has gone badly,  whether it be dealing with boat people, whether it be trying to sort out the live cattle industry, now climate  change. Just about every big decision she’s made has been the wrong one. So, there’s no doubt people are  very unimpressed and very disappointed.

PRESENTER:

Alright Tone, let’s change tacks just for a minute. Obviously, being very popular, my first question - I  teased this earlier on the show - being popular, that popular, does that work when you get home?

TONY ABBOTT:

What do you mean when I get home? If I get home! I mean, at the moment, I don’t think I’ve got home for  about ten days straight. But look, Margie and the girls were good enough to come and visit me in Melbourne  overnight and look, you know…

PRESENTER:

Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more, Tone. I know what you got up to.

TONY ABBOTT:

I might be doing ok in the public sphere but in the private sphere there’s no doubt who’s boss.

PRESENTER:

Well answered.

PRESENTER:

Hey mate one more for you. I like to call you the Eddie Murphy of Australian politics - your laugh, I love it.  You’re on the Project tonight, Julia was on last night. Surprisingly, she was entertaining.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, she can be. Look, there’s no doubt about it, she’s a pretty ordinary prime minister but I’m not  saying there’s anything wrong with her as a person.

PRESENTER:

No. Alright, well, good luck tonight on the Project. Just with that laugh, mate, if we could just tone that  down a touch because I also refer to you as The Count from Sesame Street.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh.

PRESENTER:

One, a-ha-ha-ha. Two, a-ha-ha-ha. No, mate good luck with it. If you need any help with it, I can work on it  with you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good stuff.

PRESENTER:

Good on you and good luck with the missus too, keep working away there as well.

TONY ABBOTT:

PRESENTER:

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks a lot.
