BOLKUS MUST ACT ON DETAINEES

The treatment of the Cambodian boatpeople held In detention camps  in Australia for periods of up to more than three years without  resolution of their situation ranks as one of the most

disgraceful events in Australia's immigration history.

Such a circumstance must not be allowed to happen again.

Most Australians are understandably distressed that such an event  can occur in Australia, with its traditional concern for  humanitarian values.

The Coalition has strongly supported a case-by-case consideration  of migrant applications, and continues to do so.

The Coalition notes the judgement of Mr Justice Wilcox on 22  June, this week, that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs did not err in determining refugee claims from the  Cambodians.

However, the Coalition believes the Minister is treating the  Cambodians concerned, and the Australian public, with contempt  in his failure to justify his refusal even to consider exercising  the discretion open to him to review the issue on humanitarian

grounds in view of the most unusual and distressing circumstances  of these particular people.

This Government,  through its treatment of the boatpeople heldin  detention for such an unacceptably long time, is damaging  Australia's reputation.

It is now up to Senator Bolkus to take the necessary_action to  resolve the situation of the detainees quickly and definitively.

Further failure on his part to do so will only heighten the  growing public concern about the Minister's handling of his

portfolio. | COMMONWEALTH "
