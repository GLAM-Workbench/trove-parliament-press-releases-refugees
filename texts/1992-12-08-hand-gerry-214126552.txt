HIGH COURT RULES CUSTODY FOR BOAT PEOPLE VALID

The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, welcomed today's High Court decision  upholding custody provisions for boat people.

Mr Hand said the decision endorsed the Government's custody  provisions to detain people who arrive by boat without  proper authority, and its concern about the control of  Australia's borders.

The High Court handed down its decision on a challenge by a  number of boat people on the constitutional validity of  Migration Act provisions, introduced in May 1992, that  certain boat people be kept in custody while their refugee

claims are determined.

In commenting on the Court's rejection of one section of the  legislation, Mr Hand said: "I believe that no Court would  order the release of boat people whose detention is  authorised within the existing terms of the Migration Act".
