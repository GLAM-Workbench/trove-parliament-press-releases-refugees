THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO





E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW  NIGHTS WITH STEVE PRICE, RADIO 2GB  TUESDAY, 29 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S: Government’s handling of Sri Lankan asylum seekers.

STEVE PRICE: Well we were expecting yesterday to hear more legal argument  in the High Court about this boatload of 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers now  being held at Curtin in Western Australia, these are the men, women and  children held aboard that customs vessel The Ocean Protector, we’ve talked  about it lots of times on the program, the identities of these people will now be  determined, but the Australian Government it seems are determined to return  them to India where their people smuggling vessel left from. But what’s erupted  now is a war of words about India’s treatment of asylum seekers, we’ve even  had Greens Senator Sarah Hansen-Young comparing the move to let Indian  consular officials interview these people with letting ISIS access to people fleeing  persecution in Iraq which is an absurd claim. Scott Morrison the Minister believes  they are economic refugees, he said that today, but what about the Opposition?  On the line is Richard Marles the Shadow Immigration Minister, thank you for  your time.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION: Good evening Steve.

PRICE: What should Scott Morrison now do with these people?

MARLES: Well they need to be processed, they need to be individually assessed  as to whether or not they are genuine refugees or whether they are not genuine  refugees, and if they’re not they should be facilitated back to their home and if  they are then they ought to be taken to either Nauru or Manus. There’s no  question of these people being given a permanent protection visa in Australia,  and everything I’ve just outlined of course could have happened a month ago  and the ridiculous thing here is that Scott Morrison had these people sitting in an  Australian customs vessel somewhere on the Indian Ocean for the better part of  a month just to protect his political scorecard. And at the end of the day it’s  ended up at the exactly where it should have been three weeks ago and that is  these people being assessed to work out what their status is and taken to Nauru  or Manus or facilitated to go back home.

PRICE: The Government’s been able to argue that since we were elected no  boat has arrived, and they say that that’s the message that has busted apart the  business model of the people smugglers, can you not see why perhaps Scott  Morrison wanted to be able to continue to make that claim?

MARLES: The most significant step that any Australian Government has taken in  reducing the flow of asylum seeker vessels was the PNG arrangement that the  then Rudd Labor Government put in place with PNG last July.

PRICE: I’ve heard you say that before but do you seriously believe that when  Kevin Rudd sat down and signed that agreement, that you as a then Government  had the will to go through with that policy.

MARLES: Of course we did and it was the single most important step as I say  that any Australian Government has taken.

PRICE: But the boats kept coming.

MARLES: Well actually that’s not true. If you look at what then occurred over  the next two months, you saw a dramatic drop off in the boats, that persisted  right through to the end of the year, without any substantive policy being put in  place by the current Government, so there’s no question, and 90 per cent of the  boats, 90 per cent of the flow reduces by virtue of that step.

PRICE: And you don’t think boat turn backs can an influence on the numbers  that were setting sail from Indonesia?

MARLES: Clearly turning around boats since last December has had an impact  over that period of time, one of the real questions about that policy is its ongoing  viability in circumstances where Indonesia absolutely loathe it. So when all of  this has been implemented of course in the context of in effect a suspended

relationship with Indonesia, we still don’t know how that turn back policy is going  to work when we have a normalised relationship with Indonesia and what we’ve  seen is that when you have a relationship as we have with India, it’s a very hard  policy to implement. So there’s a whole lot of question marks about that now,  but if you look at what steps have been taken which have really made a  difference, the most important one was the one we took as a Government last  year, now I’d be the first to say and I’ve said it on your station before, that  mistakes were made by Labor in Government, I think if we had our time again  back in 2008 we would not have closed Nauru and we wouldn’t have closed  Manus.

PRICE: So you wouldn’t have ripped up the John Howard plan?

MARLES: Well I think it would have been better if that had not occurred, but I’d  also make this point, Scott Morrison had an opportunity three years ago to work  with Labor to put in place the Malaysian arrangement which would have had by  his own logic the result in resolving this issue three years ago, he didn’t do that.

PRICE: But you would have got swamped by the numbers wouldn’t you, you  had Malaysia sitting there but the deal was and I can’t remember the exact  numbers off the top of my head

MARLES: 800.

PRICE: 800 for 5000.

MARLES: Let’s look at it Steve, Scott Morrison is out there right now saying that  his turn arounds since December is what has made the difference. Now we don’t  know exactly how many people have been turned around, but if you look at the  numbers leading up to last December, it can’t be more than three or four  hundred, the Malaysian arrangement provided for effective turn arounds of 800.  By Scott Morrison’s own logic this would have resolved the issue three years ago,  what stopped it, is that he teamed up with the Greens to prevent Labor being  able to do that. I don’t think anybody listening to Scott Morrison now, could  believe for a second the rhetoric he used then, in preventing the Malaysian  arrangement from being put in place, so if we’re going to look at blame during  the past, Scott Morrison -

PRICE: Okay, let’s go back to the Indian vessel, to Australians listening to us  tonight, how do you explain to them a group of people who were in Sri Lanka  leave because they felt they were being persecuted because they were Tamils,  end up in India in a Tamil friendly region of India, get on a boat and try to come  to Australia. By any definition aren’t they economic refugees, why wouldn’t India  have taken them in and why wouldn’t they stay in India?



MARLES: Well this is of course the argument that Scott Morrison -

PRICE: And I don’t want to prosecute his argument but it seems common sense  doesn’t it?

MARLES: Except that if that is Scott Morrison’s argument, we need to remember  that a month ago, Scott Morrison was apparently trying to return this same boat  load not to India but to Sri Lanka, so his argument has changed in the last few  weeks, but the answer to the question is -

PRICE: Well the High Court won’t let him send them back to Sri Lanka.

MARLES: Exactly, but now he’s saying [inaudible] to the High Court and  because they come from India they are by definition economic refugees.

PRICE: Well it’s got everything to do with the High Court.

MARLES: Well I agree with you, it does have everything to do with the High  Court. Scott Morrison won’t say that but there’s no question that the reason we  are seeing actions play out now is because the High Court has had to step in, if  effect [inaudible] Scott Morrison’s portfolio because he doesn’t know how to do  it, I mean that’s actually going on here. But to go out there and say that every  one of those people is an economic migrant without looking at their personal  cases if they’ve actually pre-judged their situation, and he’s treating these people  as a collective as a group, but they’ll all have individual stories, individual  circumstances and who knows what they are, there may be a number within  them who are genuine refugees.

PRICE: Is it fair for refugee advocates to be arguing that we should be paying  compensation and that the Government should be answering to the High Court  for false imprisonment?

MARLES: I’ll let those who are prosecuting that case make out that argument,  from my point of view, I think what needs to happen here now, which is what  should have happened from day one, is these people need to be simply  assessed, if they are in fact economic refugees they should be facilitated home  and if they’re not, and they are real genuine refugees, then Manus and Nauru  are there, and that’s where they should go, no question about any of them  getting a permanent protection visa in Australia. That’s never been on the table,  but this would have been a simple way to go about this and the only reason it  didn’t happen was to protect Scott Morrison’s own political scoreboard and it was  overreached from day one.

PRICE: Good to catch up with you thank you very much Richard.

MARLES: Nice to have a chat Steve.
