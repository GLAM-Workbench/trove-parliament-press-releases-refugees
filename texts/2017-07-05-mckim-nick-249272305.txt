Media Release: Dutton's illegal detention of Australians

July 5, 2017

Peter Dutton must accept responsibility and come clean about his illegal detention of at  least two Australian citizens, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

"Peter Dutton wrongfully robbed these Australians of their freedom," Senator McKim  said.

"He is running an offshore detention regime that has deprived thousands of refugees  and asylum seekers of their liberty and deliberately harmed men, women and children."

"Whether through incompetence or design, the focus of Peter Dutton's cruel regime has  now been trained on Australian citizens."

"This scandal was kept secret for many months. How many other Australians has Peter  Dutton illegally locked up?"

"This kind of scandal has cost Ministers their job in the past. How much more cruelty  and neglect will Malcolm  Turnbull let Peter Dutton get away with?"
