ABBOTT INTERVIEW WITH STUART BOCKING AND TRACEY SPICER  (RADIO 2UE) - MCGRATH FOUNDATION, AUSTRALIA-INDIA RELATIONS,  PETER SPENCER, PRIVATE SCHOOL FEES

The Hon Tony Abbott MP

Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

STUART BOCKING:

The Opposition Leader is on the line, Mr Abbott, Good morning.

TRACEY SPICER:

Morning

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Stuart, Gday Tracey, how are you?

STUART BOCKING:

Very well, how did they con you in to this one?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh look, it’s the holiday season and I thought that it would be a good thing to do. I’m not quite back at work

fulltime and why not go to the cricket ground for a very good cause. Support some people who have been

working very, very hard to raise funds for the McGrath Foundation and then watch the cricket and hopefully a bit

of a fight back by Australia.

STUART BOCKING:

Well let’s hope so. Now I know you’re a confirmed boardies man now as opposed to the budgie smugglers. Will

that be the piece of pink you’re wearing today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I will just wear the team uniform. I wore the Speedos because that’s the uniform for the club swim at

Queenscliff. I will be wearing the Pink Lads uniform. I don’t think it involves any Speedos but if it does they will be

covered up by running shorts I believe.

TRACEY SPICER:

That’s a relief, I had a vision of you in pink Speedos I’m afraid so thanks for clarifying that.

TONY ABBOTT:

As we speak Tracey, I am in green and white Lycra.

TRACEY SPICER:

Well it’ll be in the tele tomorrow for sure.

STUART BOCKING:

We will alert the newspaper reporters, you might be able to knock Lara Bingle off the front pages in the green and

white Lycra.

Now, we do have to look at a couple of important issues and there is one obviously now out of Melbourne. Indian

diplomats are going to meet with Australian counterparts for crisis talks today. It follows on from the murder of an

Indian migrant in Melbourne. The situation here obviously is sending some very, very bad messages back to

India. What is your take on what’s been occurring and what can we do to try and calm some of those concerns

that might be emanating out of India?

TONY ABBOTT:

Stuart, look I think the best thing we can do is not make too much of it. I mean obviously it’s a terrible tragedy. It

really is a terrible tragedy but the officials in Victoria seem fairly confident that it was not racially motivated, given

that, that is the view that there doesn’t appear to be any evidence that it was racially motivated I think we should

just treat it as a standard homicide and do the best we can to solve it but obviously it is a terrible tragedy when

anyone is murdered and we just have to give every support that we can to the law enforcement agencies.

STUART BOCKING:

I know this is probably more a State issue but there is certainly a growing feeling within Victoria that there may be

some race elements involved with some of this street crime particularly involving other ethnic minorities. Is it just

too easy to gloss over that by saying, oh well if the authorities aren’t prepared to say that it’s a racial thing well we

won’t suggest that it is because it does appear that there may be some glossing over of some of these elements?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes Stuart, I think it is equally easy to leap to conclusions. I mean you know I think it is a human tendency to see

sinister aspects of things. Now, obviously there’s something horrible about any murder but I don’t think we should

readily conclude just because the victim is of a particular ethnic group that there is that racism unless there is

some fairly strong evidence. Unfortunately there is a bit of a gang culture in parts of our cities and my guess is

that murder is murder and it should be simply treated that way rather than seen as more than it is. I mean it is an

evil thing, we should treat it as an evil thing and we shouldn’t make a bad situation worse.

TRACEY SPICER:

Tony there is an argument in this country though that racial intolerance in Australia stems from the Howard

government’s policies on asylum seekers which to a degree have been continued by the current Rudd

government.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah well look Tracey, I completely reject that. I mean every Australian government; Liberal or Labor has wanted

to maintain effective border protection. Some governments have been much better at it than others but let’s not

forget that it was the Keating government which first began the policy of mandatory detention and it was Kevin

Rudd himself who said before the last election that he’d be strong enough to turn boats around so I think to try

and pin up things on the Howard government is a bit unfair.

STUART BOCKING:

On another issue Tony, in relation to this farmer, Peter Spencer, there was this protest outside Federal

Parliament yesterday. There seemed to be some divisions within elements of the Liberal Party and the National’s

over this. Bill Heffernan has very strong views as he normally does one way; Barnaby Joyce is very much in

support of the farmer. As Opposition Leader having to bring the two parties together, where do you stand on all of

this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think that in the end it is up to the Government of the day to address these problems. We have got State

government land clearing legislation which is causing Peter Spencer and many other farmers these difficulties.

It’s the Federal Government which ultimately takes responsibility for what happens in this country and I think

Kristina Keneally and Kevin Rudd really do need to sit down and reach agreement with the farming community

and do what they reasonably can to solve this. I think that’s where the focus should be.

STUART BOCKING

Question inaudible…

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a serious problem. Under the national Constitution you do have to pay compensation if your property is

taken from you by government action and the same requirements don’t sit on the States. Yes it is an issue;

generally speaking State governments haven’t wantonly reduced people’s asset values by their own actions but

unfortunately with this plethora of environmental legislation, all of it well intentioned, much of it just a justifiable.

Nevertheless it has impacted on people’s property values. It has reduced the value of their assets and you can

understand why they feel ripped off.

STUART BOCKING:

Can I then construe that to mean that if for instance, a State government as part of an expansion of a CBD metro

or some where else wants to reclaim somebody’s business, somebody’s land then technically speaking they

wouldn’t necessarily have to pay compensation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they are not required to under the State constitutions.

STUART BOCKING:

Extraordinary isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Federal Constitution is more prescriptive than the State Constitutions and it’s a weightier document

generally speaking than the State Constitutions but normally the State’s would pay compensation but I guess in a

case like this they haven’t actually taken the land all they have done is dramatically restricted what you can do

with it.

STUART BOCKING:

That’s right yes.

TRACEY SPICER:

Tony, parts of the legislation that Senator Joyce denounced yesterday, parts of that legislation were actually

brought in my the Howard government in relation to the carbon sinks and the Kyoto protocol. Is he defying your

call on the 11th of December for Cabinet solidarity?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I am not familiar with the precise detail of what Barnaby said yesterday but my recollection of what the

Howard government did back in 2003 or 2004 was that it gave the New South Wales government several

hundreds of millions of dollars which were designed to in some way compensate farmers who were impacted by

this legislation. I have to say that typically what State government’s do with Federal government money is that

they pocket it, they don’t use it for the purpose for which it was intended. It wouldn’t at all surprise me if rather

than handing that money on to farmers as it was supposed to the State government used it for its own purposes.

STUART BOCKING:

Just quickly Tony, on one other point and I know your only just sort of getting back in to the swing of things.

There is a story around today about the dramatic increase in private school fees. Now the Howard government’s

been a great supporter of private schools and I have no problem at all with public funding being used to assist

private hospitals, private schools. That’s continued under Kevin Rudd but alongside that increase in federal

funding there has also been a marked increase in fees as well. The original idea was if there was more money

coming federally to these schools that would help abate some of those increases in fees. Why isn’t it happening?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well in the end these are private institutions and it’s up to them to decide what their fees should be.

STUART BOCKING:

They are also recipients of increasingly large amounts of public money.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, that’s right. And the reason for that is because every Australian child is entitled to government assistance

towards his or her education. Now, whether people choose to utilise that assistance by going to a public school or

whether they choose to go to a private school and receive a reduced level of support, but nevertheless a

substantial level of support, that’s up to the parents of the child, so we don’t support these schools because we

think they should be free or almost free we support these schools because every kid is entitled to get government

support towards an education. Now, obviously it would be better if fees were lower and the increases were less

but in the end it is up to these schools to make their own decision on….

STUART BOCKING:

Does a six per cent increase though across the board generally speaking seem excessive to you in light of the

Global financial slowdown, the CPI and various other measures?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am just not sufficiently familiar with the kind of cost structures which these schools face.

TRACEY SPICER:

Regardless of their cost structures their fees went up nine per cent last year and then six per cent this year.

Surely that’s an indication that they’re ripping students off?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again if they are ripping students off, this is an issue for the Federal government. I think Julia Gillard should

be out here justifying Federal government policy because I am in opposition Tracey.

TRACEY SPICER:

Yeah, but the SES funding was brought in under the Howard government was that a mistake then in retrospect?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, no look it’s very important that the Federal government support the right of kids to the education that their

parents choose for them. Whether that be public education or private education but in the end if any aspect of

education system is falling down that is a problem for the government of the day. Now we will announce our

policies on these matters well before the next election and if there are any problems we’ll do our best at that time

to address them but as things stand this is a matter for Julia Gillard who I think is on deck.

STUART BOCKING:

She is on deck.

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t think she is a prisoner of the Lodge, a prisoner of Kirribilli House, the way Kevin is. So why don’t you get

Julia on the program and ask her to justify and defend these fees?

STUART BOCKING:

We might just do that. You mentioned the election, it is an election year. If you were tipping a month what do you

think it’ll be?

TONY ABBOTT:

My guess for what it is worth is that it will have to be before November because that’s when the Victorian election

will take place. So my tip is that it will be called early September to mid- October.

STUART BOCKING:

We wish you well; have a great day at the SCG. Thanks so much for your time.

TRACEY SPICER:

Thanks Tony

TONY ABBOTT:

Good luck to Australia and let’s hope they a good third day.

STUART BOCKING:

Well I am pleased to know you’re their as the 12th man if they need you. All the best Tony thanks so much.
