DIMIA answers beggar belief:  continued inaction on HREOC report  25th May 2005

In answers to questions put by Senator Kerry Nettle during Senate  Estimates today, officials from the Department of Immigration insisted  that the timing of the release of Virginia Leong and her daughter  Naomi had nothing to do with media reports highlighting their case.

"The department wants us to believe that just as it was a coincidence  Cornelia Rau was found to be mentally ill and transferred to hospital  on the same day that her identity was revealed so the Leongs,  coincidently were released the week after adverse publicity on their  case," Senator Nettle said. 'This explanation of events beggars belief.

"The reputation of the Minister and the department is in tatters and  today's performance in Senate Estimates has done nothing to change  that.

"The department even admitted that their have been no specific  changes to immigration detention procedures in the wake of the  damning HREOC report into the detention of children released last  year.

Senator Nettle asked the head of the Immigration department Mr Bill  Farmer whether the Minister has instructed the department to make  any changes in the wake of the HREOC report and he replied. "We  have had no specific directions from the minister about the HREOC  report."  "The Leong case would have been avoided if the Minister had  taken the HREOC report seriously but clearly she did not.    "The department and Minister have revealed themselves as unwilling  to change, entrenched in an aggressive mindset that puts government

policy ahead of compassion for anyone caught in DIMIA's net."
