.  T h e :Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Andrew  Peacock, said today that the Australian Government had noted the  broadcasts from FRETILIN, sources over the weekend reporting ' renewed, fighting’in East Timor. These reports appear to have .

received confirmation in press reports from Indonesia. The  Australian Government had reminded the Indonesian authorities of  Australia's opposition to the use of force in East Timor.

Mr Peacock noted that the reports of renewed fighting  had come within a ;few days of the adoption by the United Nations  Security Council of a resolution which expressed the Council's  concern about the ;  conflict, in East Timor and in which the .  Â· . '

Security Council had agreed to the appointment of a special .   representative of\the Secretary-General to proceed to the . territory to assess the situation there. The Australian GovernÂ­ ment had welcomed;this decision by the Security Council which  had accorded with'proposals that Australia itself .had made in

the statement delivered by its representative to the Council on .   16 November. The Australian delegation in New York had worked  hard for the adoption of a constructive decision by the Security  Council; it had been particularly gratifying, that the resolution  had been passed, unanimously, by the Council.

.  .  Australia was therefore disappointed.at the report that the new authorities in Dili h a d .requested the Secretary-General.   to postpone the planned visit of his representative. The  Australian Government's position is clear: it believed that the

Secretary-General!s representative should leave for East Timor  forthwith and: that he should be admitted without delay or .  Ã¢ÂÂ   . prevarication. '  ! Ã¢ÂÂ   Â· . ' _ Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· Â·  "  .  .

.  Mr Peacock added that the.Australian Government was .

also, anxious that Ã¢ÂÂ  ;  the International Red Cross Teams should be  permitted to return to East Timor to resume their humanitarian  relief programs. |The Australian Government had. made several  approaches to theÂ·Indonesian authorities in this regard. ‘

.  It was imperative that, all parties should provide  immediately the guarantees necessary to enable, the International..  Red Cross to resuAte its operations in East Timor. The Australian  Government was very keen .to resume and step, up its own

contributions: to the relief effort and, as before, would channel  its assistance through the International Red CrossÂ»

The Minister recalled that,  in regard to Timorese  refugees,  he had already made clear that the Government would  wish to adopt a generous attitude should a refugee situation  arise. The problems facing possible refugees further underÂ­

lined the need for the Internetidnal Red Cross Teams to return  to the territory as soon as possible. It was in this area that  Australia's diplomatic effort would continue to be concentrated.

The Minister concluded that allegations that the  Australian Government had turned its back on the Timor situation  were unfounded. Australia had indeed been more active than any  other country, in the region or outside it, in trying to bring

about a peaceful settlement in East Timor..  This applied to  Portugal,  nominally the administering power. Mr Peacock recalled  in this regard that,  while Australia had no formal responsibilities

for East Timor, it had through its successful work in the United  Nations,  through the Government's unequivocal calls for the.  cessation of hostilities, and through our,proposals for the  appointment of a United Nations special representative for  East Timor, played a positive and constructive role in trying to

resolve the present crisis. Australia had also been very  positive in the humanitarian area where Australia's official  contributions for relief have far exceeded contributions forthÂ­ coming so far from any other source. '

Finally, the Government was endeavouring to press  Indonesian authorities,  and through them AP0DETI and UDT, to  allow the recommencement of all relief efforts beginning with  the immediate resumption of the programs administered by the  International Red Cross.
