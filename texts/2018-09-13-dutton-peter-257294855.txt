RAY HADLEY:



I'll get to that weather across the network very, very shortly, but I wanted to chat to the  Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. He's on the line. Minister, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:



Good morning Ray.

RAY HADLEY:



Tomorrow is three weeks since the former Prime Minister lost his job, took off to New York  on holidays, complained about the media following him, but still can't resist having a crack.  I've just said on air - whether you heard it or not - he's confirmed what most people tell me  of him. He's self-centred, he's egotistical and he won't let go. He's now the Kevin Rudd of  your party.

What comment do you have that he's confirmed overnight that he's been lobbying your  colleagues to get you to go to the High Court?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Ray, just a couple of points. I mean, obviously mine is one of respect for former Prime  Ministers regardless of the circumstance. So I think John Howard's got the gold standard  here. I think he conducts himself with dignity and I hope that all former Prime Ministers can  do that.

All of us want to see Scott Morrison elected because we don't want Bill Shorten to be the  leader of this country.

And on the Section 44 stuff - look, a couple of points. One - the Labor Party raised this in  October of last year in Senate Estimates and then they never mentioned it again. My wife's  business interests are well known. I've never taken a dollar in distribution out of that  enterprise. That's the reality. It's my wife's business and the former Prime Minister knew all  of that detail. Mr Turnbull never raised once with me any issue around Section 44. His staff  never raised it with my office. He never asked me for the legal advice that I had that showed  I had no problem at all and the first that was ever mentioned by Malcolm Turnbull was  during the leadership week. And the other point to make of course is that Mr Turnbull,  when the Labor Party sought to refer the matter to the High Court, voted for it not to be  referred. So people can draw their own conclusions and judgments.

I hope that Mr Turnbull is able to enjoy his retirement and contribute to the Liberal Party, as  I say, in a way that John Howard has. That would be the ideal circumstance.

RAY HADLEY:



Well I know you won't confirm it, but it seems incredible that he'd be doing this from his  apartment overlooking Central Park, being the same person who offered you the position of  Deputy Liberal Leader in the last ditch effort to get you to drop off.

PETER DUTTON:



Well, as I say Ray, people can make their own conclusions. I served the Turnbull  administration loyally for a long period of time and I made every effort to make the  government of Mr Turnbull's work and that's a matter of history.

Now we look forward. I think Scott Morrison has started very well. I think he's talking about  issues that are important to people - getting electricity prices down, making sure we keep  our country secure, all of that - which is actually what matters to people, not the beltway  issues in Canberra.

RAY HADLEY:



Now it appears today there's been a softening by Fairfax Media, who have been chasing you  about Mr Quaedvlieg for quite some time, because they now admit that one of the claims  made by Mr Quaedvlieg, among many which have been unsubstantiated, is actually they say  factually unsubstantiated. It's a second claim by this bloke that's been undermined.

There's been criticism of you for using parliamentary privilege to go after him. Not from me,  I think you're fully entitled to do it in light of what he's tried to do to you.

But I read this piece yesterday that was published on Friday night in the Courier Mail by  Renee Viellaris in relation to exactly what transpired with this bloke and social media  accounts, where he received an inquiry from a young woman, 22 at the time, to perhaps to

be part of Border Force. He deemed it important as Commissioner that he talked to her  personally about it. Some people may say that what you said in Parliament was true, but the  story that I read and shared with my listeners yesterday would leave me in no doubt that  this young woman was targeted by a very powerful man at the time in an effort to get her  into Border Force. Now she's facing a court appearance sometime in the foreseeable future.

But it's not in dispute that he sent 28,000 texts or exchanged 28,000 texts with her between  March and August 2016. It's not in dispute that he exchanged 1500 images including a  naked selfie - he's denied it, by the way, but we'll rely upon the fact that Freedom of  Information would see us obtain those if we need to.

When's this going to end with Quaedvlieg? When does he run out of oxygen in relation to  the accusations he makes against you?

PETER DUTTON:



Well Ray, that's really an issue for Mr Quaedvlieg. I think - again, a couple of points to make  here. He has given evidence that can't be relied on. He's a discredited witness and it's a sad  story really because he had a long and successful policing career, but was under  investigation, as you say. He's still - and it's on the public record that he's still under criminal  investigation. He's obviously bitter at the fact that he lost his job and, as I say, those matters  have all been well documented. I think even the latest version of his evidence now has been  discredited as well. I think people need to look at the motivations.

I've conducted myself with integrity at all times. The Labor Party and the Greens and The  Guardian, The Sydney Morning Herald and others have run hard on the comments of course  and when comments are proven to be wrong they don't appear on the front page anymore.

But that doesn't matter too much because look, the Greens and Labor hate me because of  Operation Sovereign Borders, the tough decisions. But I have cancelled now over 3000 visas  of people that have committed criminal offences. I think I've had a common sense approach  to visas where we've had to overrule the Department.

I think this matter's now put at rest. Labor went hard for a few couple of weeks during the  media, through the media, and then getting into Question Time asked me a couple of  questions and then they drop off it. Yesterday I didn't get a question on it all.

So I think it - look it demonstrates that Mr Quaedvlieg has issues and, as I say, I hope that  he can deal with those. But it's not an issue that should continue on because I think now  people realise that fabricating evidence and providing that false information is just in no  oneâ€™s interest.

RAY HADLEY:



One of the things that I corrected yesterday, thanks to Renee's article in The Courier Mail,  he took leave in May 17 from his job while the investigation was launched after questions  were raised about him - Quaedvlieg and Sarah Rogers and how she got the job with Border

Force. It was then referred to the organisation known as the ACLEI who continue their  investigations. It was reviewed by the Prime Minister - the then Prime Minister and Cabinet  - but you've been blamed through this and they say it's a square up because you sacked  him. The Attorney-General Christian Porter, with the support of the then Prime Minister  Malcolm Turnbull, in March recommended he immediately be sacked. The statement of  grounds of termination released said that Mr Quaedvlieg was terminated for engaging in  conduct inconsistent with his position and the failure to disclose details of any material or  personal interest that had been related to the affairs of the Australian Border Force. It  accused Mr Quaedvlieg of having engaged in acts and made omissions which materially  advantaged that candidate over other comparable candidates for ABF employment and on  that basis, his conduct also amounted to misbehaviour inconsistent with his affirmation.

Further, Mr Quaedvlieg engaged in misbehaviour and conduct inconsistent with his  affirmation by failing to disclose to the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency  within a reasonable time a significant change in his personal life. It also said he was  terminated because he failed to reveal that he was in a relationship with the person who  was seeking to get a job within the ABF.

So all of this of course was put in place by the Attorney-General with the express permission  of the then Prime Minister. I know you're part of Cabinet, but you didn't sack the bloke at  the end of the day, the Attorney-General did.

PETER DUTTON:



No in fact I recused myself from the discussion or the consideration of the matter because I  was his boss if you like as Minister. I thought it appropriate, and the Attorney-General  thought it appropriate that he deal with it. And obviously there was a lot of input from the  Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as well so all that process was independent.

The other point of course Ray is that Mr Quaedvlieg's former executive officer, or his chief  of staff, now works as a senior adviser to Bill Shorten. And Mr Shorten has still not answered  any questions about whether he has offered a job to Mr Quaedvlieg or whether Mr  Neumann, the Shadow Immigration Minister, has offered a job to Mr Quaedvlieg or whether  they've had any discussions about information being out in the public domain.

So look, there are many elements to this, but what have they sought to do? They've sought  to try and tarnish my reputation.

As I say, I conduct myself, I think, in an appropriate way and there's nothing that they've  been able to point to that demonstrates that I've acted inappropriately and I stand by all of  the decisions that I've made and I'm not going to allow my reputation to be tarnished by  people of this calibre.

There was plenty of discussion about these 17 individuals who landed in North Queensland.  I believe that Operation Sovereign Borders has reinforced its position and I believe all 17  individuals have returned to Vietnam, is that correct?

PETER DUTTON:



That's correct. So they've gone back.

We've increased the surveillance both on the water and in the air and through our  intelligence gathering otherwise. So this is a continuing threat Ray. We know the people  smugglers are still out there.

The important point to make here though is that the 17 people from Vietnam who arrived  on the boat have all gone back under us. The likely outcome under Labor would be that  those people would have stayed here because they offer permanent protection visas and  this is a big issue because had the 17 stayed, it would have sent a very clear message that  the gates are open again, you're ready to go, pay your money, hop onto the boats and we'll  restart it.

And that shows you how difficult a balancing act it is, but it shows I think the determination  of this Government why we've had success and what would happen under a Shorten  government. If those 17 stayed, boats would have followed, no doubt at all.

RAY HADLEY:



Am I right in confirming that at least two people who appear to be the organisers remain  here facing charges?

PETER DUTTON:



Well again Ray, there are operational matters in relation to people that are both onshore  here in Australia and offshore who have been responsible or involved in organising these  syndicates, putting people on boats etc. and there are a number of matters that are still  under investigation at the moment.

RAY HADLEY:



Just back to that fella you mentioned and I think his name is Paul Iozzi. He was also - apart  from being Mr Quaedvlieg's chief of staff - he was also the Chief of Staff of the former Labor  MP at the time when he was a former Labor MP and then came back into Parliament Mike  Kelly from Eden Monaro I believe. Is that also right?

PETER DUTTON:



He's certainly got deep Labor links and, as I say, you know, Mr Shorten employs this fellow,  has this fellow had direct conversations with Mr Quaedvlieg about these matters? None of  those questions have yet been answered.

But it's interesting, when you get all the facts, it paints a very different picture than what  Fairfax and others have been trying to paint over the last couple of weeks.

RAY HADLEY:



We'll talk next week. Thanks for your time.

PETER DUTTON:



Thanks Ray. See you mate.
