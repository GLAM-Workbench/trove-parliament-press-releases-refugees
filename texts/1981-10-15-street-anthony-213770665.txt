AUSTRALIA AND ASIA 1981 - RETROSPECTIVE AND OUTLOOK

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Tony Street MP,   in an address to the 25th Anniversary Dinner of the Australian-   Asian Association of Victoria, said today that Australia's relationÂ­ ships with the countries of Asia must be based on "equal dealing".

"Australia is now involved in a complex set of relationÂ­ ships in Asia, in which mutual political and economic rights and   interests must be worked out in what is normally a tough, businesslike   basis day by day," Mr Street said.

He pointed out that since the 1950's Australia and its   region had changed greatly. Australia's Asian neighbours now largely   enjoyed political stability as well as unparalleled economic growth.

Mr Street said that Australia was today accepted as part   oC the region. He added that Australia could contribute to its own   growth by developing trade and investment opportunities in the region.   The flow of trade and investment however must be a two-way process.   Asian countries expected to compete equitably in world markets.   Australia could not continue to pursue a policy of increasing

protection for its markets. Both for domestic and regional reasons   Australia needed to adjust its economy.

Mr Street also said that human rights issues would from   time to time create difficulties but that an equal relationship meant   we did not interfere in our neighbour's affairs. However, we could   make clear our own values to our neighbours without interfering in

their affairs.

Mr Street warned that although security and stability had   improved in the region, there still loomed uncertainties created by   global strategic problems caused largely by the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union had extended its presence in the region -   through Vietnam and would continue to seek opportunities as they arose.

Mr Street said that regional problems were open to interÂ­ vention or exploitation. This made it more important to try to solve   local problems in their own terms rather than waiting for,  and then   reacting to, the involvement of external powers.

However, he believed the overall situation in Asia was   better than most people expected following the Unites States withdrawal   from Vietnam. The political environment was one in which proposals   for a "Pacific Community" had emerged.

Mr Street said that problems of population growth and refugees   were likely to continue and would require development assistance and   emergency relief aid.

Nevertheless the region had progressed over the past   25 years. If Australia was prepared to show vision it could   further contribute to the betterment of the region.

AS I SAID BEFORE, WE SOUGHT SUCH SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT. .

It i s now v er y  im p o r t a n t  t h a t  in the next  decade  we

CONTINUE TO WANT TO BE PART OF THIS DYNAMIC ECONOMIC

REGION.

THE REMARKABLE GROWTH IN THE REGION'S ECONOMY MUST '

BENEFIT US. AUSTRALIA CAN ENLARGE ITS OWN GROWTH AND

EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS BY MORE ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT TRADE ...

AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE REGION. Ã¢ÂÂ BUT THE

FLOW OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT MUST BE A TWO-WAY PROCESS.

As i a n  c o u n t r ie s  e x p e c t  to compete  e q u i t a b l y  on world

MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR OWN. I f AUSTRALIANS BURY THEIR

HEADS IN THE SAND OR CALL FOR HIGHER AND HIGHER PROTECTION

TO SEEK TO AVOID ANY NEED TO ADJUST TO THESE RAPID

CHANGES, THIS COULD LEAD TO A DEGREE OF POLITICAL

OSTRACISM BY THE REGION. THAT IS QUITE APART FROM BEING

ECONOMICALLY SELF-DEFEATING : RESULTING POSSIBLY IN

HIGHER PRICES,. LESS EFFICIENT- ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, .

SLOWER GROWTH AND DIMINISHING STANDARDS OF L IV IN G .

OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, IMPORTS ALREADY SUPPLY A

UNACCEPTABLE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS ARE TO BE AVOIDED
