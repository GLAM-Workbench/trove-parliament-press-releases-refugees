Ã¢ÂÂ   .  .Mr MacKellar .was addressing the Gala Dinner of the South Australian Italian Association at their centre in Adelaide on Saturday evening."Migrants will remember that economic mismanagement by the Whitlam Government between 1972 and 1975, led to a doubling in unemployment among people born overseas," Mr MacKellar said. .'  "Between November 1972 and November 1975, according to Quarterly Labour Force Survey estimates, unemployment of overseas-born rose from 36,900to 70,000." - /Mr MacKellar said migrants would remember the Whitlam Government's solution to the problems of migrants because of its economic mismanagement. Â·"That solution was to cut off migration to Australia, he said. "In the three years of devastation his Government wreaked, migration to Australia was halved and migrant unemployment doubled. Ã¢ÂÂ"Migrants will remember the callous attitude the Whitlam Government displayed towards family reunion migration in October 1974, by leaving many > relatives of Australian residents who had previously qualified for migration to Australia isolated from their relatives in Australia by the sharp cut-back in the migrant intake. ."Between 1973-74 and 1975-76, migration from Britain was cut by two-thirds as was migration from Europe." _2 /

In his address to the South Australian Italian Association, Mr MacKellar ,

quoted from a statement by Mr Whitlam in Sydney on Friday evening,, in .

which Mr Whitlam had' said: "The statistician revealed in August "

that unemployment was running at significantly higher levels among

migrant men and women than the general population.1 1

Mr Whitlam had also said: "Hhese statistics _represent hardship for many

men, women and their families who had come to Australia expecting a 'happy

and successful life', but whose hopes have been dashed."

Mr MacKellar told his dinner audience: "This is simply not true. The

August 1977 Labour Force Survey estimated that 5.2 per cent of the

Australian-born workforce was unemployed, and 5.4 per cent of the overseas-

born workforce was unemployed. " "

"It is of interest that in February 1975, 5.4 per cent of the overseas-born

workforce was unemployed.

"There has in fact been a reduction in the estimated number of overseas-

born members of the workforce unemployed in August 1977, compared with

May 1977." '  y .

Mr MacKellar said that in May 1977, the Labour Force Survey estimated that

89,300 overseas-born members of the workforce was unemployed and in

August the estimate was down to 86,800. .

Bearing in mind the substantial inflow of Lebanese and refugees in the

period up to August 1977, this was a hopeful sign. In fact, migration in

recent months had been running at a higher level than for some years and

yet the number of migrantsunemployed was declining. .

"The_unemployment rate among overseas-born is inflated by new arrivals

who have always experienced a higher rate of unemployment during their

settling-in period due to the necessity to obtain accommodation and to

become familiar with local conditions," Mr MacKellar said.

3 .

"Significantly the rate of unemployment among new arrivals (since

January 1976) has decreased from 17.9 per cent in May 1977 to 11.7

per cent in August 1977.. The decrease suggests that the 13,000

Lebanese who have arrived since June 1976 are now starting to find

employment.  .  x

"This is a tribute to the migrants themselves who are showing great

initiative in finding work." .  ^

Mr- MacKellar acknowledged that there were groups of recent arrivals

experiencing difficulty in finding work.

'It is surprising and unfortunate that Mr Whitlam should seek to make

political capital out of the employment problems of the 20,000 refugees,

evacuees and Lebanese who have sought sanctuary in Australia in the

past 18 months," he said. . . .

"These pe* j>le have come to Australia mainly to survive and to build a

new life out of the tatters of civil war and internal conflict in their

former countries. .  '  .

'Ihe Fraser Government has seen this offer of sanctuary as the first

priority." :

Mr MacKellar said he would be meeting with the Lebanese community

in Sydney on Monday evening to discuss ways of overcoming the problems

of persons who had arrived recently from the Lebanon and he was hopeful

that these discussions would point to initiatives which would lead

to a further reduction in unemployment in this group.

"It is regrettable that Mr Whitlam should seek to create divisions \

within Australian society by promoting the idea of a labour market divided

between Australian-born and migrants," Mr MacKellar said.

"The whol^e Australian community, both Australian-born and overseas-born,

will recognise that their future prosperity depends upon sound economic

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  management.

"Mr Whitlam has already demonstrated that he is incapable of .

providing sound economic management. The steps already taken .

by the Fraser Government which have involved necessary

stringencies in expenditure, have paved the way for soundly-based

economic progress in the future. That is in the interests of all

Australians."
