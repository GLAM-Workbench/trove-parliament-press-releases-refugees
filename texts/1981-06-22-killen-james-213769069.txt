REFUGEES PICKED UP BY HMAS MELBOURNE

The aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne is heading for

Singapore with 99 Indo-Chinese refugees on board, rescued in

the South China Sea about 200 nautical miles due east of Ho

Chi Minh City late yesterday. ;

The refugees, 33 men, 37 women and 29 young jchildren,

were all suffering from malnutrition and sea sickness when they

were rescued by HMAS Melbourne, which was on passage from Hong

Kong to Singapore.

The rescue, carried out in pitch darkness, followed

an earlier sighting by a patrolling aircraft piloted by

Sub-Lieutenant Dave Marshall.

It was the second sighting of a refugee boat

within several hours.

Earlier a Grumman Tracker aircraft from HMAS

Melbourne sighted a small boat with about 30 refugees on

board. Contact was immediately made with the Liberian

freighter MV Karaka which headed into the area and picked

up the refugees before continuing on to Hong Kong.

Following the sighting of the second boat the destroyer

escort HMAS Torrens,  commanded by Commander Mike Rayment, was

sent to investigate and reported the boat had about 90

refugees on board.

began the transfer of the refugees to HMAS Melbourne under the

supervision of Lieutenant Commander Lyn Smith.

said they had left Vung Tau on June 16 .

They were given medical examinations and treatment

on board HMAS Melbourne. Family units were reunited and they

were given food and warm clothing.

The 15 metre vessel on which they had been travelling

was examined by a boarding party from HMAS Torrens and found to

have little food on board. The engine was unserviceable and

the craft unseaworthy.

As the vessel was posing a hazard to navigation it

was destroyed by a demolition team from HMAS Torrens.

next Friday (June 26),
