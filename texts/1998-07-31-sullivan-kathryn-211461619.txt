AUSTRALIA COMMITS $1 MILLION TOWARDS PEACE IN SRI LANKA

Â

I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide $1 million towards 
bui lding a lasting peace for conflict-ravaged areas in the North 
and East of Sri Lanka.

Â

More than one and a 
half million people living in these areas continue to be affected by 
a 15-year civil war.

Â

Of these, approximately 
600,000 are children aged under 18, many of whom have lost one or both 
parents. Some have witnessed their relatives being killed, maimed or 
disabled.

Â

These people need help 
to overcome the disruption and trauma caused by years of conflict.

Â

Australia will support 
the work of two international aid agencies helping Sri Lankan children 
and women deal with the effects of armed conflict. These agencies are 
also assisting people who are finally able to return to their homes 
by improving their community’s infrastructure.

Â

*Â $500,000 
will be provid ed to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) 
to promote landmine awareness, help find extended families for orphans, 
provide rehabilitation for children affected by conflict and reintegrate 
disabled children into normal activities and schooling.

Â

*Â $500,000 will be provided to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help rebuild social and economic 
infrastructure. Funds will be provided for programs to assist families 
to earn income through cottage industries such as dairying, fishing, 
seafood processing and vegetable marketing. Communities will also be 
supported with wells for drinking water, trauma counselling for conflict 
resolution and educational supplies.

Â

Australians will assist in managing and monitoring these  projects, 
which are an important stepping-stone to help conflict-affected communities 
return to a normal life. The contribution to UNICEF also represents 
another practical expression of the Australian Government’s commitment 
to the eradication of the use of landmines.
