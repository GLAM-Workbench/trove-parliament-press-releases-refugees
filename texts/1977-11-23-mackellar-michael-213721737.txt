was being given to surveillance requirements essential to safeguard AustÂ­

ralia against unauthorised entry and to maintain the effective standards

of quarantine xdiich had prevailed in Australia* '

There were the important considerations of protecting Australia against

the introduction of diseases which could tin*eaten Australian livestock

industries and agricultureÂ»

Any necessary changes in requirements for surveillan.ee arid patrol would

be considered urgently by the Interdepartmental Committee on Surveillance.

It was essential that entry to Australia was controlled — - but any action

taken to ensure this had to be leavened with humanity and compassion for

the plight of genuine refugeesÂ» Â·

The Ministers said the despatch of an additional task—force was to assist

the orderly international processing of refugees in the Malaysia-Singapore area

and thereby avoid.the need for genuine refugees to make the hazardous voyage

strengthened by another officer from Australia. This would speed up selection

and processing of refugees. '
