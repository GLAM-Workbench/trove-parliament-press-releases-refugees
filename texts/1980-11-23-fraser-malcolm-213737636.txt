ELECTORATE TALK

Now that the Federal election results have been finalised,  Australia's 32nd Parliament will assemble'next Tuesday for its  official opening by the Governor General.

The constitution requires that after any general election,  the Parliament will be summoned to meet not later than 30 days  after the day appointed for the return of the writs.  However,  apart from this constitutional requirement, it was the  Government's vie^r that a Parliamentary sitting before Christmas  would provide an opportunity for us to get on with the job.

Because the Australian people once again returned my Government  with a substantial majority, we are naturally keen to implement  those commitments which were outlined in my election policy speech  as soon as possible. Â·

An important priority of course is to continue the fight against  inflation.  It remains our belief that an improvement in economic  growth is the most effective way to reduce unemployment.

An important priority of the Government as we enter another  term of office is assistance to Australia's youth, especially  those who are having difficulty finding a job. We have a very  real desire to enable youth to articulate its concerns, and to  take note of that voice. We are also expressing our commitment  to youth through our educational initiatives for those who  are about to leave school and are seeking to join the work force.

It is a Â·difficult time for all young people,  and we firmly believe  that all possible assistance must be given to educate our young  people for the future. After all, Australia's future lies in  the hands of the young men and women of today. Attention is being  directed in particular to those whose orientation is less academic  and who may leave school early. With this in mind, we have

introduced the School-to-Work Transition programme with a  Commonwealth commitment of $150 million over the next five years.  Young people are being offered a range of options in education  and training as real, meaningful alternatives to the academic  stream, and the Government has further boosted its efforts to .   assist young people in making the important s_tep from school  to work by announcing a new transition allowance. .

Yet these education and transition initiatives do not exist Ã¢ÂÂ  in a vacuum. Preparation for work must be followed by the . .  opportunity to work. Another direction of our commitment . to youth is ensuring that young people are given the opportunity

to gain employment, both through our broad economic strategy  and through training and manpower programmes. Our economic  .  policies have already led to a gratifying growth in employment  over the past year, and will lead to further improvements

in the future. Our policies have played an important part  in providing an increase of over 200,000 jobs over the last year  including almost 40,000 jobs for teenagers. .

We are also taking steps to ensure that young people are  .  properly equipped to take advantage of the job opportunities  which are in fact opening up. In 1980-81, our manpower,  training and special youth programmes will help over 220,000

young Australians. We have set aside over' $100 million for .   this assistance which includes subsidies under CRAFT and  the Special Youth Employment Training Programme and assistance  under the Community Youth Support Scheme.

The encouragement given to young people to become involved in  community service, to retain their work orientation and to  develop skills for the future underlines the real contribution  that they can make to Australian society.

The Government considers that the election provides us with  a mandate to continue the basic policies which we have developed  and implemented over the past five years. It is .our firm .  Â· belief that economic and social progress can only be achieved  on the basis of a firm.confidence, both within Australia and  ~ overseas, that the Government of Australia will adopt a n a Â­

.  pursue stable, sensible and reliable policies and will always  act in a responsible manner. We will show again that we are  worthy of that confidence by demonstrating a firm resolve to  get on with the job. .  Ã¢ÂÂ

"  Many of us when we gather for the new Parliament,, will be  Ã¢ÂÂ   saddened by the death of a very great Australian and a great Parliamentarian, Sir John McEwen, who died last Thursday. It is difficult to know where to begin to praise someone

like the late Sir John. There are many facets of his career  which deserve particular mention. I think if I had to single  out one, it would be his dedication to all Australians

Although he was a member of the Country Party, he did represent  all Australians, not only the rural parts of this country. His career in this Parliament as a Member of the House of  Representatives for an unbroken period of 37 years, during  which time he served as a Minister of State for 26 of them,

including a short period as Prime Minister, is unequalled.

His interest in all things Australian brought about a great  increase in manufacturing industry which enabled us to become  more self reliant. During his period as Minister in Charge of  Manufacturing Industry, there was a great growth in that

industrySome might have thought that there is an odd irony in  that, that as Country Party Leader, that was one of his very great  achievements. It just shows that he was prepared to govern and  adopt policies for all Australians. .  '

As'I have said previously, Sir John McEwen was a great  Australian,  and a very great Australian leader. I was  honoured and privileged to serve in the Parliament with  him, and to serve in government with him. In addition,  he

was a great friend. .  .

My Government and I grieve deeply for him, and our sympathy  goes to his widow, Lady Mary McEwen.  . .
