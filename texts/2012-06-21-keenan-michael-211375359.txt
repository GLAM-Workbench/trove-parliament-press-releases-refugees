Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 2GB Interview with Luke Grant June 21, 2012

Topics: Asylum Seeker Boat Tragedy

Luke Grant

I have the Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan, on the line. Afternoon Michael.

Michael Keenan

Good afternoon Luke.

Luke Grant

Boy oh Boy Michael we have spoken on this issue a lot over the last couple of years and I can’t believe that it could get  worse but it seems like it has got worse, with reports now suggesting that 200 people on this boat that has capsized north  of Christmas Island. Have you heard much more than this? What can you tell us?

Michael Keenan

No I haven’t and it has only come over the wires in the last 15 mins, in fact it has only come over the wires whilst I have  been on hold waiting to talk to you. I don’t have any further information about it, apart from what I have heard in that very  brief news report that has come out saying that a boat has capsized north of Christmas Island but there is no further

information about it at this stage.

Luke Grant

It is going to be one of those line in the sand moments, where someone says come on Canberra, come on Federal  Parliament and do something. Australia can no longer be a magnet for these people.

Michael Keenan

I think that is right. I think we crossed that threshold a long long time ago but unfortunately the Government still doesn’t  seem to understand that it needs to do something different if we are going to get a different result than what we are getting  at the moment. I have been hoping they will change their minds and adopt policies that we know are going to work but  unfortunately they just don’t show any sign of wanting to do that and that is why we have this status quo arrangement  where we have had 2000 people have arrived in the last six weeks alone. So not only are they not doing anything about  the terrible result that we have had in the past but this problem is getting worse. And yet they continue to sit on their  hands.

Luke Grant

So we have had three boats in the last 24 hours and now, hopefully not, but reports suggesting 200 people on this boat  capsizing north of Christmas Island, it is just a terrible business. I don’t know how but we have to find a solution, sooner  rather than later. Michael we were going to talk about the Budget consequences but given what has just happened, I think  that is a conversation for another day.

Michael Keenan

I think that is right Luke and I need to find out some more information before I could tell you anything further.

Luke Grant

Alright Michael thank you for your time. Michael Keenan, he is the Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection.
