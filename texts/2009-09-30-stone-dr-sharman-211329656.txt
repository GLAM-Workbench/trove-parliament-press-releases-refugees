PRIME MINISTER, STOP IGNORING THIS PEOPLE SMUGGLING CRISIS

The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

Already this year, 31 boats carrying 1627 unauthorised arrivals have been intercepted by Australian authorities

and taken to Christmas Island.

The most recent boat was intercepted by Australian authorities last night, near the CocosÃ¢ÂÂKeeling Islands. The 43

passengers on board the distressed vessel had to be rescued.

Prime Minister Rudd must immediately stop ignoring this expanding crisis. Lives are being lost at sea while this

surge in people smuggling continues.

Labor’s unravelling of strong immigration policy is a major factor in the surge of unauthorised arrivals.

Since the Rudd Government started softening immigration policy in August 2008 38 boats have arrived carrying

1806 people. Ten boats have been intercepted in this month alone.

Scores of other boats carrying unauthorised arrivals have been intercepted by Indonesian authorities.

In the 2007Ã¢ÂÂ08 financial year, prior to the Rudd Government’s weakening of immigration policy, only three

unauthorised boats carrying 25 people were intercepted in Australian waters.

The crisis began in 2008 when the Rudd Government abolished Temporary Protection Visas, softened

mandatory detention rules, abolished detention debt and created a new upfront option for permanent residency

for those who do not meet refugee criteria.

Mr Rudd and Immigration Minister Chris Evans must immediately review the impact of its softer policies on the

surge of people smuggling we have seen since August 2008.
