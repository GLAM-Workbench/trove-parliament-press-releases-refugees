SPEECH BY THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,

THE HON TONY STREET MP

Summary of main points

1. The conduct of Australia's foreign policy has become more complex

.  The international community is much more tightly integrated

and interdependence between nations has grown

.  trade, aid, energy, food, immigration and refugee and  similar issues have an increasing bearing on the conduct  of foreign policy

.  the issues necessitate clear perceptions of Australia's  national interests. The gap between the contents of the

issues and public perception of them must be narrowed -  public discussion must be promoted.

2. Australia as a Middle Power ,

.  Australia is a significant middle power. Depending on  circumstances, middle powers can have considerable weight  in some issues. This demands good judgement and flexibility  in assessing situations and the appropriate response

.  the balance of opportunities and constraints is more  complicated for middle sized powers than it is.for the  very small or very powerful

.  the impact middle powers are able to achieve depends on  the skill and quality of their human resources.  It is

essential that the conduct of Australia's foreign policy

be of a high and professional standard

.  because its resources are limited, the range of issues

on which Australia should concentrate is limited. National

interests must determine the issues on which Australia acts.

.  the breadth of Australia's interests make it proper to

declare its position on all major issues.

2. ' Ã¢ÂÂ  i

.  in some circumstances a middle power can be more

effective than a great power as it does not bring too

much weight to bear or automatically engage the interest

of other great powers; for example,  in the search for a

settlement in Zimbabwe

.  the significance of declaring positions should not be overlooked in an environment in which symbols and principles  can be crucial. Taking a position on issues is not merely  posturing

. for Australia the management of relations with the  United States is of prime importance.  The ANZUS link  should continue to receive bipartisan support

.  ties of friendship and common interest do not mean that

the national interests of the two countries always coincide

.  the desire to maximise the benefit of co-operation and  concern to safeguard independence of action brings with

it inevitable differences

.  changes in the structure of international relations

have highlighted the contradictions in Australia's  historical origins and geographical location

.  Australia is a "north" country which shares many of the  interests and perceptions of the "south"

.  Commonwealth meetings have shown there is scope for

constructive initiatives by middle powers

3. Current issues in Australian foreign policy

.  there have, over the past six months,  been extensive  discussions on Kampuchea.  Australia regards the  implementation of the UN resolution on Kampuchea as  essential for the restoration of peace in the region

. Australia's derecognition of Pol Pot was because the regime  was repugnant and the issue of recognition distracted

attention from the basic strategic and political questions

at issue '  .  '  .

.  Australia also had to weigh the opinions and interests

of other countries. These affected the timing of

3.

derecognition.

Australia's opposition to Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea

remains implacable.  The Government rejects the claim by

Heng Samrin to be the legitimate representative of the

Khmer people and deplores the continued Vietnamese

occupation of Kampuchea.

Australia deeply regrets Vietnam's refusal to accommodate

the legitimate interests and concerns of its neighbours  and to play a more constructive and co-operative role in  the region

Australia will continue to support the interests of ASEAN  countries and watch carefully efforts to create a new  political grouping of Khmers. It will review its position

if the situation changes significantly.

visits to Japan and China earlier this year confirmed the  soundness of Australia's relations with these countries.   Australia and Japan have similar democratic and free  enterprise institutions. While Australia and China have

differing perspectives, they have a common view of Soviet

policies and intentions and a wish to see stability in Ea

it is in Australia's political and strategic interest  as well as its commercial interest that China maintain

its outward-looking policies ,

talks with senior members of the new Administration have  strengthened the impression that the Administration means

what it says. A greater degree of predictability in the  content and conduct of United States foreign policy seems

likely

the philosophical perspectives and analysis of the internatÂ­ ional situation of the Reagan administration basically coincide

with those of the Australian Government.  These include  shared concern at the military buildup by the Soviet Union  and the need to improve consultation among Western allies

4. Relations with the United States

the new Administration sees the possession of adequate

4.

military power as reducing rather than encouraging the

chances of armed conflict

.  the new Administration believes economic,  human rights,

strategic and political issues cannot be dealt with in

isolation. They are interrelated, as events in Central  America reveal

. Australia believes human rights issues are of greatest

importance.  But economic reform and human rights issues  cannot be divorced from questions of security and strategy

.  the shared views on most issues between Australia and the  United States does not imply across-the-board agreement

on all matters.  .  As a middle power Australia's perspective

will necessarily differ from those of a superpower on  some occasions

.  as an ally, Australia will continue to pursue as helpful  and co-operative a role as possible.  But it will make  its contribution on the basis of an independent national  effort Ã¢ÂÂ

. Australian assistance to the United States can only be on  the basis of consistency with Australia's national  interests and maintenance of national sovereignty

5. Australia and North/South Issues

.  as a middle power and important trading nation Australia

can play a role in North/South relations

.  vital global interests are at stake in efforts to resolve

North/South issues. Stability will largely depend on  progress towards easing tensions between the developed and

the developing nations

.  the evolution of a more equitable international economic

order will bring significant economic opportunities for

the "North"

.  1981 is not a propitious year for the North/South dialogue.

Serious economic difficulties in developed countries and

heightened East/West tensions have distracted attention

from North/South issues

.  the forthcoming CHOGM will provide a unique opportunity

for leaders from both the North and the South to transform

the dialogue over North/South issues into practical  measures
