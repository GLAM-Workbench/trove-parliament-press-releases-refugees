A new 17-member Australian Ethnic Affairs Council,  replacing

the former 24 member Council, was announced by the Minister for

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Macphee,  today.

increased efficiency and effectiveness, he said.

It would continue to be headed by Polish-born Foundation

Prof. Jerzy (George) Zubrzycki, CBE.

'  Mr Macphee said that after reviewing the various advisory

bodies in his portfolio, he had decided there was a need to.continue

A.E.A.C. .  '  :

About half the members of the new Council had been reÂ­

appointed to provide continuity of experience but the opportunity

had been taken to allow some people who had not previously served

on the Council to make a contribution.

The first Council was. established on 31 January 1977 by

the previous Minister, Mr MacKellar. The new members have

been appointed for a term of two years to 1982.

The decision to continue the Council emphasises its

value as a source of advice on problems and aspirations of

the migrant communities and the strong links he wanted to

retain with Australia's ethnic groups,  Mr Macphee said.

He made a special point of saying that he had been

anxious to give an opportunity for young people to make a direct

contribution and therefore he had included some younger people in

the new Council. ,

Mr Macphee said that the Council advised him on the

integration of migrants into the community,  the suitability and

effectiveness of Government programs and services directed to the

integration of migrants, and the position of migrants related

to health, welfare, housing, education,  employment,  communÂ­

ications,  the law and other areas which affect their well-being.

Other aspects of the Council's terms of reference were

promotion and development of harmonious relations within the

Australian community and forstering an understanding of migrant

cultures. .

The Council also suggested and encouraged studies and

research programs related to these aims.

The first meeting of the new Council will be held in

Canberra 20 and 21 March.
