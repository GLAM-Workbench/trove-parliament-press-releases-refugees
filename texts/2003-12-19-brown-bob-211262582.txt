Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania



Vanstone Should Go to Nauru

19th Dec 03

Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone should go to Nauru to sort out the developing  crisis at Australia’s detention centre, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

“For many, including dozens of children at Nauru, this will be their third Christmas  behind the razor wire. Amanda Vanstone should spend this Christmas with them to  defuse the situation” Senator Brown said.

“The pacific solution, with offshore detention centres and areas like Christmas Island  excised from the migration zone, must end.

“Nauru should be closed with those detained brought to Australia to have their cases  properly reviewed by Australian courts.

“I call on both major parties to commit to one set of migration laws for all of Australia  and all those who arrive here,” Senator Brown said.
