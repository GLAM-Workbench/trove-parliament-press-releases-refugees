OPPOSITION WELCOMES REPORT ON

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Â

The Federal Opposition toda y endorsed a report by a committee 
of experts looking into the growing problem of illegal immigration to 
Australia.

Â

Acting Shadow Immigration Minister, Martin Ferguson, 
said the recommendations by the External Reference Group (ERG) report 
on illegal immigration were an important first step in the fight to 
curb people-smuggling to Australia.

Â

“The External Reference Group has identified that 
people-smuggling is an international, multi-million dollar industry 
that is preying on vulnerable people,” Mr Ferguson said.

Â

“Labor endorses the report’s conclusion that we 
need to send a stronger message to people-smugglers that Australia is 
not a soft target for their operations.

Â

“Illegal immigrants who are able to afford to pay 
their way should not be given preferential treatment over genuine asylum 
seekers. We must defend the integrity of our immigration program.”

Â

Mr Ferguson also welcomed a new push by Immigration 
Minister Phillip Ruddock to curtail illegal immigration through an overseas 
information campaign targeted at source countries such as Iran, Jordan, 
Pakistan and Turkey.

Â

However, Mr Ferguson said that the Government’s 
priority should be to secure international cooperation with source countries, 
rather than spending money on glossy brochures, posters and postcards.

Â

“At the end of the day, a publicity campaign is 
not going to stop anyone who desperately wants to come this country,” 
Mr Ferguson said.
