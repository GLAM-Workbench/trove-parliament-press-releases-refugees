j2/ivm/u f  //~c ÃÂ® SPEECH BY THE H O N .  M.J.R. MACKELLAR,  M.P . , MINISTER FOR .IMMIGRATIONÂ· ^   AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS, TO THE STABLE POPULATION (Z.P.G., S.A.) FORUMÂ·' Ã¢ÂÂ   :  ON "TOHARD A POPULATION POLICY FOR AUSTRALIA" '  ADELAIDE - 9 AUGUST 1976 .  ' MR. CHAIRMAN, You have already had the benefit of hearing Professor Borrie  give a review of the First Report of the National Population Inquiry  which he headed. That Inquiry, which was commissioned under the  Liberal/Country Party Goverhment in 1970, has provided the basic  framework in which a national population policy can be developed. As Professor Borrie has mentioned, the process of studying components  of population growth has not ceased with the publication of the  Inquiry's First Report. . It is perhaps unfortunate that the formuh. tion of a  community, and Government, approach to population objectives and  policies is taking place in a period of high unemployment which,  with reasonable fortune, will be untypical of the remainder of this  century and beyond. Ã¢ÂÂ   There is probably no time, however, which is ideal for the formulation of national population objectives and policies. In  periods of high levels of economic growth or boom times, there are  people who argue that we should not seek to develop longer term  objectives since they would be determined on the basis of untypical  circumstances. In the end wre have to accept that there is no time  like the present even if, both in the economy and in our population,  the economic experience and high levels of unemployment over the  past few years provide a pessimistic framework for developing  policies for our longer term future. Despite the present difficulties, I believe that it is of  fundamental importance to Australia and its people to think about  the size and composition of our population 25  years and more ahead. I have no doubt that if the community decides that we should not  seek to increase our ;population, and this means primarily by  adding increments to it by migration, we run the risk of becoming  increasingly inward-looking and of becoming a stagnant society. If  we seek to expand the Australian population in the longer term, an active immigration programme is essential. Any i-mmigration programme  has a 'number of components - family reunion, acceptance of refugees,   in ter-country adoptions, as well as the more remarked upon worker  rec .ruitment. It is patently false to speak of an immigration intake  as though it was all of one nature. As Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs,  I shall seek to ensure that the immigration programme  itself does not contribute to unemployment in this country. We have  a selective programme which is also .non-discriminatory,. designed to  facilitate family reunion and also to bring to this country people in  occupations where there is a strong and continuing demand in the  local labour market. This policy should in fact generate new  employment opportunities rather than add to unemployment. '"t b I teelieve that the real issue in the longer term is not  whether Australia should aim at a stable population but the extent  of our increase in population. I have asked the Australian Population  and Immigration Council of which Professor Borris is a member, to  prepare a Green Paper on Population and Immigration Policies. This  Green Paper,  which I hope will be tabled in the Federal Parliament  early next year, will outline the basic issues and options ÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂÃÂ· to  Australia for the future and, hopefully, will encourage informed  public deba.te about where Australia should be going in the population  and immigration areas. On the basis of the Green Paper and the  reaction to it, the Government will be reviewing papulation and  immigration policies. , The end result of this exercise should be the development  of population and immigration policies which accord with the  community's values and foreseeable national needs. A P I C 1s membership  comprises a distinguished group of people with wide technical  expertise and exceptional personal qualifications. It includes  experts in a variety of academic disciplines, (economics, demography,  sociology, environmental studies and foreign policy) as well as  experienced industrialists, trade union leaders and members of , community organisations. '  Â· The Council itself is as appropriate a body to formulate  a Green Paper on Population and Immigration Policies as one could  hope to find. Nevertheless,  the primary purpose of preparing a  Green Paper is to assist the Australian community to participate in 3  - w  'determining what changes are to .occur to our population and  immigration policies and, therefore, what the future size, growth  rates and composition of our population are to be. Accordingly,  APIC is calling for submissions from groups land members of the  public about the matters to be covered in the Green P a per.   Advertisements will be appearing in the national and ethnic press  in the near future seeking these submissions. I hope that everyone with an interest in this vital  matter will respond to this invitation. Against this background you might well ask whether there  is any purpose in continuing this discussion since, with, the  commitments I have given, I am .unable to prejudge what will emerge  from the Green Paper or the community's reaction to it. .Nevertheless,  thete are some facts and some considerations which need to be taken  into account now. The first point is that there is no doubt that Australia  cotild sustain a much larger population than we could possibly reach  this century or well into the next century. With sensible adminÂ­ istration and sufficient forward thinking we could double or even  treble our present population without seriously depleting most of  our resources, threatening the environment or risking a deterioration  of our present,  or a higher, standard of living. This is not simply  an assertion. It follows from the studies of the National Population  Inquiry. It is not a case of could we - it is a case of should we,  and if so, by how much and by what methods. A second point is that any future increase in Australia's  population through migration or the natural fer6ility rate will make  no more than an insignificant difference to the overall level of  the earth's population and will not add to the threat of the depletion  of its resources. Our domestic fertility level has already reached  long term replacement level.  In fact for the present, zero population  growth is a dead issue as far as the people of this country are  concerned. Migration itself involves a transfer of people which is no more than infinitesimal in comparison with the earth's total  population.. In these circumstances the limits to our population growth 4  - will be determined not by the availability of natural resources  but primarily by how the community sees the desirable Australian  society of the future. I am o n 'record as saying that I believe in some economic  and population growth. I shall be interested to see whether the  Australian Population and Immigration Council suggests that specific  population objectives,  even in a broad range,  are desirable. Perhaps  what we should be aiming at is not an optimum population of a  particular level but a rate of increase in our population which is  designed to achieve certain broader objectives. In other words  population growth itself should not be the objective but it should  be directed to broader societal goals. '  It. is the definition of those  goals which is the first step in determining what our population  and immigration strategies should be and I am not avoiding the issue  by saying that I prefer to wait to see what emerges in the Green Paper 1  I think it is worth while spending a little time in considering the implications of our present migration programme  since it draws attention to a number of important points which some  people now seem to be forgetting. In times of high levels of  unemployment it is natural that people and groups try to find a '   scapegoat. Migration is an obvious scapegoat when unemployment is .   rising. There are now those who s ay that the migration programme  for the current financial year should be cut back so that unemployment  will not be worsened. ,You will have read that in the current .   financial year the Government has set a migration programme of 70.000 persons. By no means does that mean that 70,000 persons will  be entering the worksforce. In fact, mfr Department estimates that no more than a third of that 70,000  programme will enter the workforce  That is, our programme will bring to Australia no more than 23,500  persons who will be seeking work. The remainder of the intake are  dependents,  spouses, parents or others not seeking to enter the  workforce. We estimate that some 20,000 close relatives of  Australian residents will be among the 70,000. Of these no more  than 4,000 will be seeking to .enter the workforce. Apart from these  family reunion cases there will be a significant number of refugees. In 1975/76 we accepted more than 4,000 refugees as well as more than 2.000 other persons who are in a "quasi" refugee situation. If we  were to accept all relatives of Australian residents who are  nominated we would in fact face apotential intake of family reunion w Ã¢ÂÂ¢  | T —*^pÂ· - 5 - cases in the current financial year of roughly the full 70,000   programme that has been set. While it is disappointing to many  Australian residents that their brothers and sisters and other more  distant relatives cannot come to this country, I think, they understand  that it would not be in their interests or in the interests of people  already here if we were to permit the broadening of family . reunion  categories in present circumstances. /  Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·   Again, we constantly review the acceptable occupations -  and it is worth noting that we have decided, in view of the state of  the building industry in N.S.W., Qld and Tasmania, not to recruit  skilled workers in the building trades for those States. ,  I might digress at this point to mention that, in a period when considerable attention is being directed to the conditions in  which migrants work in Australia,  there is no sign of a reduction in  the number of nominations by persons resident in this country of  people overseas to migrate h e r e . In 1975/76 a total of 70,425 persons  was nominated by Australian residents for entry to Australia. The  majority of these nominations were by persons who have migrated to  Australia. There is another side to the question as well. In setting  a programme of 70,000 for 1976/77 the Government was aware that there  is a substantial outflow of persons from Australia. On recent  experience we can expect a loss of some 25Â»000 residents - Australian  born and former settlers - on a permanent basis in the current  financial year. The outflow does not end there. There is almost  certain to be a substantial loss on long and short term movements. Taking these factors into account, the * net migration gain to Australia  during the current financial year will not be large - roughly it will  be around 30,000  persons and that is probably the upper limit. .  I I want to emphasise these points very strongly. The net  migration gain in 1976/77 will be less than 30,000 persons. In net  terms there will probably be not m_ore than 10,000 persons entering  the labour force as a result of migration.  A considerable proportion  of those persons leaving Australia possessed professional qualifications  or skills. The present selective migration programme which, apart  from family reunion, is designed to introduce persons with professional  qualifications or skills, in fact is offsetting the loss of skilled .

The skills, capital and initiatives  brought in by migrants are seen as beneficial to Australia. Of  course demands are placed on social servi ces, schools,  housing and  other areas. However,  a steadily growing population will assist in  providing improvement in these areas,  Nonetheless I stress that the  emphasis is on a balanced and steady programme which must be suited  to current needs. The intake will not always be restricted to highly  ski 1 herd workers,  of c o u rse. We would expect to have an intake which  rbpre'sent s a c ross-sect ion of the workforce when conditions are  more .favourable. .

Any discussion on population size will take into account  the development of our resources. I am sympathetic to the view  that an expanding Australian economy will be able to play a more  vigorous part in assisting the underdeveloped countries of the world.  To do this most effectively we should make use of our natural  resources in a way which will not threaten the continuing availability  of the resources we will be needing in the future. Technological changes cannot accurately be foreseen. However, at this stage there is no reason to expect that a growing  workforce will not be required. In fact in the p a s t ,  the displacement  of labour by technological change has not left vast numbers unemployed  rather it has made labour available to meet.other community needs -  which had not previously been met. There are also advantages of  scale - certainly a growing economy, not necessarily a rapidly  growing population,  will provide a basis for investment in AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂ  I I have been talking in terms of economic growth, stimulated  by a balanced immigration programme.

'  ADELAIDE - 9 AUGUST 1976 .  '

MR. CHAIRMAN,

You have already had the benefit of hearing Professor Borrie

give a review of the First Report of the National Population Inquiry

which he headed. That Inquiry, which was commissioned under the

Liberal/Country Party Goverhment in 1970, has provided the basic

framework in which a national population policy can be developed.

As Professor Borrie has mentioned, the process of studying components

of population growth has not ceased with the publication of the

Inquiry's First Report. .

It is perhaps unfortunate that the formuh. tion of a

community, and Government, approach to population objectives and

policies is taking place in a period of high unemployment which,

with reasonable fortune, will be untypical of the remainder of this

century and beyond.

Ã¢ÂÂ   There is probably no time, however, which is ideal for the

formulation of national population objectives and policies. In

periods of high levels of economic growth or boom times, there are

people who argue that we should not seek to develop longer term

objectives since they would be determined on the basis of untypical

circumstances. In the end wre have to accept that there is no time

like the present even if, both in the economy and in our population,

the economic experience and high levels of unemployment over the

past few years provide a pessimistic framework for developing

policies for our longer term future.

Despite the present difficulties, I believe that it is of

fundamental importance to Australia and its people to think about

the size and composition of our population 25  years and more ahead.

I have no doubt that if the community decides that we should not

seek to increase our ;population, and this means primarily by

adding increments to it by migration, we run the risk of becoming

increasingly inward-looking and of becoming a stagnant society. If

we seek to expand the Australian population in the longer term, an

active immigration programme is essential. Any i-mmigration programme

Australia for the future and, hopefully, will encourage informed

public deba.te about where Australia should be going in the population

reaction to it, the Government will be reviewing papulation and

immigration policies. ,

The end result of this exercise should be the development

of population and immigration policies which accord with the

community's values and foreseeable national needs. A P I C 1s membership

A second point is that any future increase in Australia's

population through migration or the natural fer6ility rate will make

no more than an insignificant difference to the overall level of

the earth's population and will not add to the threat of the depletion

of its resources. Our domestic fertility level has already reached

long term replacement level.  In fact for the present, zero population

growth is a dead issue as far as the people of this country are

is no more than infinitesimal in comparison with the earth's total

Australian residents that their brothers and sisters and other more

distant relatives cannot come to this country, I think, they understand

that it would not be in their interests or in the interests of people

already here if we were to permit the broadening of family . reunion

categories in present circumstances.

/  Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·

Again, we constantly review the acceptable occupations -

and it is worth noting that we have decided, in view of the state of

the building industry in N.S.W., Qld and Tasmania, not to recruit

skilled workers in the building trades for those States.

,  I might digress at this point to mention that, in a period

when considerable attention is being directed to the conditions in

which migrants work in Australia,  there is no sign of a reduction in

the number of nominations by persons resident in this country of

people overseas to migrate h e r e . In 1975/76 a total of 70,425 persons

In our geographic situation such stimuli are essential.

,  The environmental factors are complex and will be closely

monitored. The basic position which I have adopted is that economic

growth and a population growth assisted by a moderate and steady ,

immigration policy will not necessarily involve greater destruction

of the continent's natural resources. In fact the stimulus provided

to newer technologies should prove beneficial. .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Finally, I come to the question of how we should go about

formulating a population policy. .

Broadly speaking, population policies may be "passive" or

structures without attempting to change them and gears social and .

economic policies accordingly. .

Australia would have been without them. Apart from this they have

made our country a more culturally diverse and rich place to live

in. .  If we assume the continuation of current fertility trends to
