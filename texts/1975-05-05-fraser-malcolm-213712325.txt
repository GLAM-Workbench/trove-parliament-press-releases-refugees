MR. FRASER CHALLENGES PRIME MINISTER OVER MIDDLE EAST. Â·

Mr. Whitlam's misleading of the Parliament and the people over Vietnam  inevitably raises serious doubts about the even handedness of the  Government's policies in other areas, particularly the Middle East.

The evidence revealed last week of the Whitlam Government's encouragement,   and sympathy foy, the communist cause in Vietnam adds to the growing concern  about the impartiality of the Government's policies in the Middle East.

There is every reason to fear that, the Government is as much involved in  duplicity and deceit in this area as it clearly has been in Vietnam.

There have been a number of instances that have raised questions about a.  two-faced approach to Israel.  '  .  Â·  '

The Government has been quick to condemn additional assistance for Israel,  but much slower to react to Russian re-equipment of the Arabs. .

The Whitlam Government censured the United States when it implemented a  general alert to counter a Russian move to intervene physically in. the  Middle East and claimed that the Americans were involved in a domestic plo y ,  .

This was despite the fact that the Prime Minister knew the move was .

initiated by the National Security Council which is prevented, by statute,   from giving cognisance to internal events.

There is yet further evidence of the Whitlam Government’s partisan approach. It takes an unrealistic attitude to neutrality in the Indian Ocean, and  opposes the United States development of a base at Diego Garcia, even  though this.could have a vital bearing on the future re-supplv of Israel.

Diego Garcia could become the only remaining air link, for the. United States  in the Middle East. Ã¢ÂÂ   .

Agianst this background is it any wonder that the Prime Minister's double  dealing in Vietnam generates' uneasiness and uncertainty about his foreign  policies across the board?

It has been proven that the Government has been pro-communist in VietnamÂ·,  and has been sacrificing Vietnamese refugees in; the interest of good relations  with Hanoi.  The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were  prepared to try to deceive the Parliament in order to cover up this partisan

approach. ,

There are many indications that the Whitlam Government is involved in double  dealing in the Middle East, this time to strengthen its friendship with  Moscow, presumably at the cost of Israel.

I am prepared to give the Government a chance, belatedly, to restore some  confidence in its policies. .  .  .

1 invite the Government to make a full statement on all that it has been  saying to both sides in the Middle East. .

At the same time I request the Prime Minister to let me see - on a

confidential basis - the copies of the exchanges between Israel, the Arab  countries, Russia and the United States where such messages touch on -   MiddleÂ· East policies. .  . .  ... .

I will be glad to give a public reassurance if these communications show  that the Government has been entirely impartial in its Middle East relatic  and not pro-communist as would seem to be the case. -It is distressing that we now have physical violence in Australia between'

sympathisers and Jewish people. .

The ambiguity of the Labor Party's official attitude - and the direct  support for the PLO cause by some prominent ALP members - is not 'ir re levari  in this deplorable development. '  Ã¢ÂÂ

The pro-PLO attitudes of Mr. Bill Hartley, a member of the ALP executive,  are well known and he is closely involved with the Australian Union of  Students which arranged the current visit by Palestinian student leaders.

It is also pertinent' to note that the PLO supporters who fought with Jews  in. Melbourne yesterday had been in the May Day march, and that the  Chairman of the May Day committee is also Mr. Bill Hartley.

The Whitlam Government has only itself to blame for increasing doubts  about its credibility.

For instance, apart from Vietnam and the Middle East, there was the underÂ­ handed recognition of the Baltic States - a further overture to the .   Russians that was performed in a clandestine fashion and which was reveals

by accident, not design.

Australians have a right to evidence of even-handedness in the Middle East  and, following yesterday's deplorable episode in Melbourne, will want  assurances that pro-PLO sympathisers within the Labor Party will not be  allowed to bring Middle East violence to our own shores.
