NATION- WIDE PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS ON AUSTRALIA’S 
IMMIGRATION   PROGRAM COMMENCE

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today marked the start of his annual national consultations on the Government’s 
migration and humanitarian programs with the release of his Department’s 
1997-98   Settler Arrivals  statistical report.

Â

Â

Mr Ruddock said the report showed that 25,985 skilled 
migrants arrived in Australia during the 1997-98 financial year, a 31.9 
per cent increase on the previous year.

Â

“Skilled migrants represent 33.6 per cent of Australia’s 
total migrant intake for the year — up from 23 per cent on 1996-97.

Â

“These figures are the best proof that changes made 
by this Government to Australia’s migration program are successfully 
attracting highly skilled migrants - migrants who generate enormous 
benefits for the Australian community.’

Â

Mr Ruddock said that for the first time a nation-wide 
series of public meetings will be held as part of the consultations 
on the Government’s migration and humanitarian programs.

Â

“Last year’s consultations included for the first 
time, public meetings in Melbourne and Perth.

Â

“These proved to the very successful and as a result 
I have decided to hold open meetings in every capital city as well as 
some regional centres this year. These public meetings are consistent 
with the Government’s promise to administer Australia’s immigration 
program in an open and accountable manner.

Â

“I hope they will provide a unique opportunity for 
many Australians to contribute their thoughts, ideas and comments.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said his consultation program helped ensure 
that Australia was eliciting the expertise it needed, and that the community 
could be confident it was getting a migration program that would benefit 
the nation.

Â

“During the consultation process I will be meeting 
representatives from more than 2,000 groups including State, Territory 
and local governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental 
bodies, welfare organisations, church groups, and representatives of 
Australia’s migrant communities.

Â

“I am also pleased this year to involve members 
of my Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council at many of these consultations.

Â

‘Their advisory role in the migration and settlement 
process is an important one, particularly on issues regarding refugee 
resettlement. The consultations will provide them with the opportunity 
to hear community views on these issues first-hand.”

Â

This year’s consultations will commence in Tasmania 
today, with extensive meetings in both Launceston and Hobart, which 
is also the venue for the first public meeting.
