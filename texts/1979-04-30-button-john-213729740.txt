PRESS RELEASE THE SENATE

ÃÂ² STATEMENT BY SENATOR JOHN BUTTON,  DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE AND SHADOW SPOKESMAN FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE 'MULTI-CULTURAL EDUCATION IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA

"South Australia is leading the nation in multi-cultural education,Senator  John Button said today following a visit to Thebarton Primary School,   Trinity Gardens Primary School,  Adelaide High School,  Adelaide College  of the Arts and Education,  and the Migrant Education Centre.  Senator Button  was accompanied by Dr Harry Jenkins,  MHR, Chairman of the ALP Caucus Educate

Committee,  and Dr Neal Blewett MHR, member for Bonython.

"Today we saw -* Young migrant school children being taught in their own  Italian language. * Australian born children having the opportunity to acquire

a foreign language while still at primary school. * A high school which offered children a choice of six languages  including Mandarin Chinese. It is of crucial national importanc  that more and more Australian acquire proficiency in Asian languages. * A CAE specifically education primary and secondary school teachers

to be specialist language teachers in Greek and Italian."

"There are valuable lessons here for the rest of Australia. The South  Australian Government and the South Australian Education Department have  demonstrated real leadership in this field."

"Very important and significant work is also being undertaken by the  substantially Commonwealth funded Migrant Education Centre in the vitally  important task of teaching adult migrants English despite the handicap of  lack of adequate Commonwealth funding which results in a meagre budget, a Ã¢ÂÂ    very high rate of casual to permanent staff,  and a lack of Commonwealth  recognition of the increasing flexibility and professionalism involved in  Adult Migrant English Programs."

"One hears throughout Australia complaints about the rigidly bureaucratic  and high handed treatment given adult migrant teachers as a result of  directives from the Federal Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

"It says much for the enthusiasm and diligence of local staff that they  can operate effectively under such conditions particularly in the very  difficult area of teaching English to Asian refugees", Senator Button said.
