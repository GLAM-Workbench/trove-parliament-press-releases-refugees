Leader of the Opposition

TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  RADIO 2UE WITH ALAN JONES

Topics: Policy release timetable; ALP advertising; Sale of Telstra; Debate; NSW  Governor; Tariffs; Unions; Health Insurance

If I could ask you just one question. Much of the criticism of you in recent months has been  about the fact that you can’t vote for John Howard, he’s a weak leader. How tough did you  have to be to survive the criticism at not releasing policy and how much pressure was there  on you to maintain your strategy of releasing them when it suited you?

Very tough and a lot of pressure but I stuck to it because I knew that I was talking  commonsense and I was also talking history. No successful Opposition Leader in Australian  political history has ever delivered the policy speech before the campaign started. That  basically is what the Labor Party and sections of the media were asking me to do. They were  asking me to say, well, the campaign has not started but we want you to fire all the shots in  your campaign locker before the campaign starts, and in parenthesis basically - and then we  can attack you for having no policies during the campaign. Now I have watched other  Opposition Leaders on both sides of politics allow their opponents to set their agendas and  allow other people to set their agendas. I was determined that I was going to set my political  agenda. The Australian public understood what I was doing. I received virtually no letters or  telephone calls from the public telling me to do what I was being advised to do by the Labor

Party and sections of the media. Wherever I went people would actually stop me in the street  and say. “You stick to your guns. Don't release the policy initiatives.”

JONES:

Are you a smarter bloke than you were last time round?

HOWARD:

I think everybody is with the benefit of experience, Alan.

JONES:

What about the ads last night, “Little Johnny Howard”? Is that meant to be a derogatory  expression to undermine your standing, do you think?

HOWARD:

Well, I’m sure it’s not designed to help me.

JONES:

But you can laugh it off?

HOWARD:

Well, of course. I mean, I’m flattered that they should start on me. Isn’t that interesting? They’ve started on me. They’ve been in power for 13 years. They’re supposed to have this  genius of a leader running the place, despite the fact that he’s presided over record debt and  very high youth unemployment and a widening gap between rich and poor. But what do they  do? They don’t start on that, they start on me. Well, I should be so lucky that the Labor  Party should decide that their only hope of winning this campaign is to attack me. I mean, I’m flattered.

JONES:

What are the people out there worried about? You’ve walked across the country and talked to  them all. What are they worried about in this campaign? What are going to be the issues  from your perspective?

HOWARD:

I think the pervading mood in the community is a sense of insecurity. They worry about their children getting jobs. They worry about holding their own. They worry about the pace of change. I think deep down people understand that change is necessary - and good change is necessary and I support it. I think there is a feeling of insecurity. I think they worry about * the fact that they can’t trust what people in authority tell them any more and one of the things

I really am dedicated to doing if I win the Prime Ministership is to re-establish that sense of trust between the public and their elected leaders. I mean, none of us are perfect. If I win the Prime Ministership I’m not going to be - I’m going to make mistakes just as my predecessors have but I do, above everything else, want to establish a bond of trust between the people and the government, to bring back the time when you can say something and people will actually believe it. My opponent of course said before the last election, “You’re all going to have an

L-A-W law tax cut” and he snapped it away after the election.

3

He said pensioners were going to be free of tax. He snapped that away. He made other  commitments. Now I’m not going to promise a lot in this campaign. I’m going to promise a  few things of course. There are changes in relation to small business. I’m going to promise

later on today some changes in relation to Sydney Airport which is important to a lot of  people. But they’re not going to be huge promises.

JONES:

Does the privatisation of Telstra, one-third privatisation of Telstra - 1 don’t want to go into  the debate for and against all that - but does that give you the money to fund whatever  promises you might make as opposed to the government setting its face against it and then  having to try and establish where it’s going to get its $460 million for the environment and  $28 million for the museum and so on?

HOWARD:

Well, we’re not going to use the proceeds of selling Telstra to fund expenditures that go on  year after year. I mean, you only get the $8 billion once and you’d be a fool if you cut tax by  $8 billion on the strength of that - 1 mean, what do you do the second year?

JONES:

Well, how do you then wind back the debt? How do you wind back —

HOWARD:

Well, essentially you use the proceeds of the sale of Telstra to retire debt. The correct  economic practice is to say that if you sell a capital asset you use the proceeds for capital  purposes and that means essentially - not entirely - but it means essentially you’re using it to

reduce debt. One of the advantages of selling Telstra is that you do get 8 - perhaps more - the  Prime Minister said it was worth - a third was worth $10 billion. Well, maybe it is. We put  in a conservative figure because we didn’t want it criticised. The advantage of that is that  you’ll be able to - apart from the advantages to Telstra you’ll be able to essentially use that to  retire debt. We will not be using it to fund recurrent expenditure.

JONES:

Every person that you’re talking to now right across this city has to each week, each month,  make sure that what they spend is no greater than what they get in otherwise they’re going to  be absolutely down the tube. It’s been suggested that the real budget deficit this year, 30  June, could be in the vicinity of $7 billion. You’ve promised to turn that into surplus. It’s a  hell of an amount to do.

4

HOWARD:

Well, on the Government’s own figures, and that’s what our commitment was based on - on  the Government’s own figures the budget will be in surplus next year. Now that’s the  Government’s prediction and we of course, in the absence of any revision of those figures -  and if the government issues a revised set of figures during the campaign, well, obviously  they have to be taken account of but based on what —

JONES:

Are they cooking the books, do you think? Can you believe their figures? Are they rubbery?

HOWARD:

Well, their track record has been very bad but I’m not going to fling an accusation around  except - unless I’ve got hard evidence. But on the basis of their figures a surplus next  financial year is achievable.

JONES:

The debate - there are going to be two debates, (February) 11 and 25 - you’ve put your foot  down over Kerry O’Brien. Who would be acceptable to you?

HOWARD:

I think there’s a range of people. Certainly, to many people in the community, somebody like  Paul Lyneham —

JONES:

And O’Brien isn’t?

HOWARD:

Well, I’ve discussed the matter, as has Andrew Robb, with the ABC and with Mr O’Brien  and we put certain views to him and, let me say this, he understands my view.

JONES:

But Paul Lyneham would be acceptable? 1

HOWARD:

I think Paul Lyneham is regarded in the community as somebody who’s tough, down the line,  in the middle, doesn’t favour either side, and that’s essentially what you want.

5

JONES:

How do you get 25 per cent of young people into jobs?

HOWARD:

Cut the burden, take the load off the back of small business. That’s the best----

JONES:

Fringe benefits tax is one of those loads. A caller this morning said he was going to abolish  fringe benefits tax. What’s he going to do about it now?

HOWARD:

Well, it would cost $3 billion to abolish fringe benefits tax and I honestly, Alan, haven’t got -  can’t find $3 billion. I can cut the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax. I can scrap the  stupid, unfair dismissal laws, which are actually discouraging small businesses from taking  on new staff. I’m going to have a task force - its goal will be to cut the paper burden by 50  per cent in the first term of a Howard Government and I’m going to reduce the provisional  tax burden, and that particular reform will be of particular benefit not only to small businesses  but of course to many people on the land and in the professions.

JONES:

Have you put Bob Carr on your Christmas card list because surely that’s the biggest windfall  you’ve received in the last fortnight, all New South Wales alienated by what he has done. Do  you have a view about —

HOWARD:

I have a very strong view. I mean, what he did was undemocratic. What, I think, Carr has  forgotten and what I suspect his mate Paul Keating has never learned, is that in this great  argument about our constitutional future it’s more important to be a democrat than to be  either a republican or a constitutional monarchist. I want to take the opportunity of saying  that Peter Sinclair and his wife Shirley did a magnificent job for the Australian public in this

State. The most offensive aspect of this whole affair has been the implied criticism of them,  that they were in some way remote from people or pompous or living in a grand style. Two  more earthy, direct, quintessential Australians you couldn’t meet in your life and they are the  most charming of people and the most easy to meet. They have less pretension about them  than many chardonnay socialists I’ve met and I think they’ve done a magnificent job and I  think the attempt to denigrate them by implication, that they were in some way remote or  pompous, is about as ungracious an act that I've seen for some time.

JONES:

You're all for reducing tariffs. It gets a very complicated issue for----

6

HOWARD:

I’m in favour of reducing tariffs provided at the same time you reduce the operating costs of  business, so that in a lower tariff environment, business has got a chance to survive.

JONES:

But isn’t that a factor in debt, because you see we’ve got fewer people in manufacturing  industry now working in manufacturing industry in this country than there were when Billy  McMahon was Prime Minister.

HOWARD:

That’s right.

JONES:

So we could virtually say to people out there, we’ll find you jobs but I don’t think we can  find you any in manufacturing. Is that a sustainable argument?

HOWARD:

Well, it’s a sustainable argument if you make - if you make other changes, I mean, what has  happened is that we’ve cut tariffs in this country, which I support, but we haven’t at the same  time reduced the operating costs of business. And the other thing that we haven’t done is that  we haven’t won enough reciprocal removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers from our trading  partners. I mean I am constantly told by...

JONES:

So why then do we reduce tariffs if we haven’t won those benefits. I mean, if we are $12.10  on average an hour for labour and say Fiji is 8 cents or Thailand is $1.80, how the hell can we  make shirts more cheaply than them?

HOWARD:

Well the answer is you won’t. And well, no, you don’t give up making shirts. There are  many people in the textile and the apparel business who are still doing quite well, but you  have to accept that in certain areas which are very labour intensive, it is very very difficult. I

mean you could sort of attempt to put a 1000% tariff on, and in some areas you still wouldn’t  compete.

JONES:

But what I don't understand is that, in cars - forget shirts - cars, our automotive trade deficit  just continues to escalate. In other words, the amount that we're paying to get cars into the

7

country increases and increases over the amount that we are ever getting in car exports. You’ve got to turn that around to turn the debt around. How do you do that?

HOWARD:

Well, you reduce the costs of doing business. Can I just give you a simple example of what I have in mind. A couple of years ago there was a lot of concern that the Sizzler restaurant chain was going to buy American beef instead of Australian beef. Despite the fact that the American beef was 60% dearer off the hoof than was the Australian beef, provided after you’d gone through the processing of the beef and all the add on things out of the farm gate, > the net result was that the American beef was 40 cents a kilo cheaper. So the American thing went from off the hoof being 60% dearer, to being 40 cents cheaper. Now, what that tells you, what it tells me, what it tells all your listeners is, is that the problem is not so much the efficiency of our farmers but everything that gets between the farmer and the purchaser, and one of the big costs of that is that cost of meat processing. And we have very expensive meat processing in this country and the reason we have it is that we have an outdated union

structure in the meat processing industry. They run a stupid thing called a tally system, which adds enormously, enormously to the cost of the finished product. Now they are the things that I am talking about when I talk about reducing the costs of doing business.

We are killing efficient producers like our farmers by loading them with all those sorts of  costs.

JONES:

Does union leadership represent workers anymore? I mean fewer than 35% of people are in  unions. What status does the ACTU have in a Howard Government?

HOWARD:

Well, they won’t be members of...

JONES:

Get a seat on the bank of the Reserve board, on the board of the Reserve Bank?

HOWARD:

They won’t be members of my Cabinet. They won’t be. And I think their representation of workers is diminishing with the passage of time. *

JONES:

Malcolm Fraser put Bob Hawke on the board of the Reserve Bank.

HOWARD:

Yes, he did. I don't know that this of itself...

8

JONES:

Bill Kelty’s on the Board of the Reserve Bank.

HOWARD:

Of itself, I’m not making commitments but of itself I don’t see any harm in having some, in  having a trade unionist on the board of the Reserve Bank, a suitably qualified one. I don’t  object to that. I think there is some merit in that but what I do object to is that in the ANL  and CRA disputes both of those disputes were taken over by the leadership of the trade union  movement. The Prime Minister was completely sidelined, he was a bit player while that  dispute was going on, while both those disputes were going on. Now that won’t happen  under us. I think the CRA dispute was very revealing because the union leadership was  arguing against a situation where...

JONES:

... against contracts.

HOWARD:

I think against people being paid more money.

JONES:

But they are against contracts. Bob Hawke told the pilots they could only get a job if they  had a contract.

HOWARD:

That’s right, that’s right, exactly.

JONES:

Just the airport. Can you solve the problem of the airport noise?

HOWARD:

Well I can certainly treat it more fairly. Look, I’m not promising a situation where aircraft  noise is going to disappear but at the moment there is an unfair concentration on a limited  number of people and our policy commits us to reopening the East West runway. It commits  us to having a cap on the air movements at Sydney airport to about 80 an hour, which of  course is above what the movements are at present. We are going to have an EIS into the  construction of Badgerys Creek.

JONES:

10

HOWARD:

Well, ten years ago. Ten years ago the E1S was carried out Alan and my gut feeling is that  unless you have a proper EIS on Badgerys Creek, the population around that area will never  accept the Government’s decision to construct it.

JONES:

What are your surveys telling you about voter backlash over airport noise? Are you in Bennelong likely to feel the impact of this? 1

HOWARD:

I would expect that for a whole lot of reasons my majority in Bennelong will be OK. I’m  more interested in some of the neighbouring seats. In fact, our policy will be of more benefit  to people who are living in Labor electorates than it will to people living in Liberal  electorates. I think there’s a lot of intense feeling about it in the inner suburbs of Sydney.

People feel that they’ve been dumped on.

JONES:

Were they lied to?

HOWARD:

They were misled, absolutely. The noise projections out of the Sydney Kingsford Smith EIS  were demonstrated over time to have been utterly unreliable - completely false.

JONES:

But the Sydney Airport noise proofing plan said over 16,000 homes should be soundproofed  but out there listening to you now, because the government said it’ll only do 4,200. Who  pays for the other 12,000?

HOWARD:

Well, what we’re going to do is to extend the plan to pick up people who are living under the  East West flight path who might suffer some noise as a result of the policy change we’re  going to make. *

JONES:

So, if the East West runway is reopened, those people who will have noise reimposed upon  them will be protected by sound proofing.

HOWARD:

Oh yes.

11

JONES:

What will that cost? .

HOWARD:

It’s very difficult to make a final estimate but it will be funded by the continuation of the  special levy that was imposed in order to fund the Government’s plan.

JONES:

Public administration, just finally, in this country. Do you understand the disillusionment  that exists amongst people about the way government runs itself, how infrequently it sits, the  way politicians fund themselves on all sorts of benefits and the extent to which you are just  constantly raped as a taxpayer to feed all that?

HOWARD:

Yes, I think there’s a feeling in the community often that the public doesn’t get value for  money and that is fed when you have a Prime Minister who turns up to Parliament only half  the number of days it sits. That’s a symbol. You might say, oh you’re just picking on the

Prime Minister but he’s the leader of the government and he symbolises an attitude of mind. I will sit Parliament longer and if I become Prime Minister I will attend every question time  when it’s in session. So, let there be no argument, I’m not going to be part-time Prime

Minister. I think there are a lot of areas of Federal and State Government where we have  overlap and duplication. One of the commitments Peter Costello made for the Coalition early  in the piece was to have an Audit Commission to examine amongst other things the areas of  duplication that exist between Commonwealth and State Governments. I think there is a  mood in the community that they don’t get value for money. I can’t answer all of their  problems and all of their concerns overnight but I have a very good ear for what they are  saying and thinking.

JONES:

Well, what they are saying and thinking is in major areas. Not welfare, but in areas like  health, where you and I should be paying for our own healthcare but we don’t have to, in  education.

HOWARD:

On health we are going to have an incentive for people to take out private health insurance.

JONES:

So it will take us off the public lists.

HOWARD:

12

*

What do you mean by that?

JONES:

It will remove my entitlement and your entitlement for going to a public hospital tomorrow.  We should have to pay our way - we can afford to.

HOWARD:

Well, if you take out private health insurance that’s the change we have in mind. We are  going to maintain the universality of Medicare, let me make that clear. I know there are some  people who don’t believe in that but we have a firm commitment to maintain the Medicare

system and we are going to maintain bulk billing and community rating. More importantly  we are going to tackle the thing that is the weakest link in the whole chain at the moment, and  that is the decline in the number of people who have taken out private health insurance. It’s  gone from 61% in 1984 to 35% now.

JONES:

And we’re paying it and it’s unaffordable. We’ve run out of time. Good to talk to you.  You’ve got a long five weeks ahead of you. We wish you well and we’ll talk to you again at  some point down the track.

HOWARD:

Thank you Alan.
