TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here in Aurukun. I want to thank Cindy Hales and her team here at the school for making myself, Nigel  Scullion and some of Australia’s senior business leaders so welcome here at the school today.

I was here three years ago to help with the truancy team. This is a school transformed: in terms of the discipline, the  attentiveness and, above all else, the literacy results of the kids, this is a totally different school to the one where I was just  three ago. So, it reflects very well on the staff. It reflects well on the kids themselves and their parents. It also reflects very,  very well indeed on Noel Pearson and his team who have been so dedicated to working with the Queensland education  department to lift the results here in Aurukun. So, I am exhilarated, I’m excited, I’m thrilled, I’m impressed. I think what’s  happening at this school is a very important lesson for the rest of Australia.

I’m going to ask Cindy Hales now to say a few words, then Nigel Scullion. Then we’ll take questions about Aurukun. Then  Nigel and I might take questions on more political issues.

CINDY HALES (Executive Principal, Aurukun School):

We’re really honoured to have Tony and Nigel and the CEOs here today. It’s just an exciting time for us to share the  strength and the directions that we’ve travelled in the last three years. Certainly there’s been really significant changes  and I think the strength of our class, club and culture model has just been embraced by families and that’s why we’re  seeing some of the results. So, what you’re seeing today is every day here at Aurukun, I’m proud to say and we’re just  really going to enjoy the weekend and enjoy the investment that is being contributed by so many of our friends to improve  the library. Now that our children can read, they’re very excited to be able to put those skills to practise. So, thank you.

NIGEL SCULLION:

Well, I’m very excited this morning. As I travel around indigenous communities around Australia, one of the great  challenges is how do we actually close the gap in education? I think coming here today, clearly this is one of the planks in  closing the gulf in the outcomes for indigenous children. I think it’s just a fantastic programme. My congratulations to the  Cape York Institute. You’ve got to get with the strength, you’ve got to keep with this programme and I would encourage  everybody to understand and learn more about this programme. This is a programme that all those children around  Australia who aren’t doing so well and don’t have those same opportunities, they richly deserve it. So, congratulations to  the Institute.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well said. Ok, do we have any questions on Aurukun issues?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, why did you bring so many business executives up here today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, as you can see, this school certainly needs some work, just in terms of its physical infrastructure. About six  months ago, I was in Cairns talking to people from Cape York Partnerships about the needs of the school. I guess I was  reflecting on my time here in 2009 and rather than apply for a government grant to upgrade the school, the suggestion  evolved into a proposal that there would be a community working bee that would help beautify the school and upgrade the  grounds, in much the same way as a school in my part of Sydney might have a community working bee to do this kind of  thing, and I thought that it would be terrific if I could come up here, and not only that, if I could bring a group of senior  corporate people up here because we all talk the talk these days when it comes to engagement with Aboriginal people  and when it comes to achieving real reconciliation, but so few of us actually experience the real life of Aboriginal people.

Now, even to come here for just a few days is better than reading about it in a book or watching stories about it on  television and I’m so full of pride and excitement that a number of very senior business leaders who have incredibly hectic  schedules have been prepared to come up here and share the experience of life in Aurukun, even for just a few days and  to actually put a bit of "sweat equity" into it - this is a term which Noel Pearson uses frequently - and for them to put a bit of  their sweat equity as well as the substantial donations that many of them have made towards the beautification of the  library I think speaks very well of their commitment to our country and their deep patriotism.

QUESTION:

Can you talk about the contrast between the last time you were here - I understand there were struggles getting kids to go  to school - and the highlights this time?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there are always struggles getting kids to school when you’ve got communities where school education is not part of  an ingrained way of life. But things are much improved. What is really striking today, though, is the atmosphere in the  classroom. The kids sit still. The kids are paying attention and, obviously, the reading results are simply outstanding  compared to what they were just three years ago.

Now, in 2008, the year before I was here in Aurukun, I spent three weeks as a teacher’s aide in Coen. Now, Coen has  always been one of the very good schools when it comes to remote indigenous education but I’ve got to say the spirit in  these classrooms is not only a total transformation on what I saw in this school three years ago, but it is a big  improvement on what I saw in Coen four years ago and Coen was always regarded as the gold standard in remote  indigenous education.

So, without getting too much in to pedagogy - which, obviously, I am no particular expert in - I’ve got to say that the direct  instruction model appears to have done extraordinarily good things. It really seems to have worked wonders for a school  like this.

QUESTION:

The Newman Government is considering relaxing alcohol restrictions in Aboriginal communities. They say that’s because  everybody should be treated the same way. Obviously, that’s going to going to create all sorts of problems for Aboriginal  communities. What do you think about that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I am confident that Campbell and his team will work with communities on this issue. Here in Aurukun there were

terrible, terrible problems with alcohol a decade or so back. Things are steadily improving; still far from perfect. There are  still cases of people smuggling booze into this community and obviously that has a pretty bad impact when that comes in.  There are more police here now than there were even three years ago. I gather the police are still running booze patrols to  try and stop people bringing booze in illegally and I’d certainly encourage them to redouble their efforts in that area.

QUESTION:

Does this model that now applies to Coen, Aurukun and Hopevale have potentially much broader application in the  country?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there are lessons here for the whole country. I’m not saying that you can exactly replicate everything that’s being  done here everywhere else but I think there are lessons here for the whole country. The Family Responsibilities  Commission has done a lot of good work. The direct instruction model, I think, is transforming some of the schools in this  area. I think there are important lessons for the rest of the country. I’m not saying that you can just lift it holus-bolus from  here and dump it down anywhere else, but there are important lessons.

QUESTION:

We are a long way from Sydney’s north shore. If you were to typify where the execs might find the biggest culture shock,  you know, just looking around, what do you see?

TONY ABBOTT:

All of these kids speak a language other than English in their homes and it was interesting in the classroom today when  they were talking to each other, they were talking amongst themselves in Wik Mungkan, which is the local indigenous  language. So, these kids are learning English as a second language but they are learning extremely effectively English as  a second language and I would have high hopes that quite soon with the kind of pedagogy we’re getting at this school  now, these youngsters will be just as fluent in our national language as they are in their local language.

QUESTION:

Do you think it would come as a surprise to the rest of Australia that we’ve got parts of Queensland that don’t speak  English as a first language?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think most Australians are proud of the fact that indigenous languages still flourish in our country and I think it's important  that we should try to preserve indigenous language where they still exist, but I also think it’s critical that everyone in this  country is fluent in the national language. You can’t get ahead in modern Australia without being fully conversant with  English and that’s what is happening here, thank God.

QUESTION:

Despite the evident support that’s put into communities like these, there’s still very little employment. Can you actually see  that ever improving?

TONY ABBOTT:

There is no doubt that in the long run every community, to be sustainable, has to have an economic base. Now, there’s a  lot of potential mining development here in the Cape, including one large potential mine just down the road. So, I think  there are reasonable prospects for a place like Aurukun to develop a more sustainable economic base. Certainly, you’re  right, a lot of people here don’t have full-time work; many don’t work at all, even on various work for the dole projects

which is, I think, a real problem. But I think this place does have prospects of a sustainable future in excess of that of  many other remote locations.

Ok, well we might just move on to some other political issues briefly, if we could. Thanks so much, Cindy.

We’ve had yet another boat. It’s one of the very biggest boats that has arrived on our shores since the current government  abolished the policies that worked. We’ve now had 379 boats. We’ve had more than 22,000 illegal arrivals. 2012 is now by  far the worst year ever for illegal arrivals and we’re only in August. This is a disaster which goes from bad to worse and it  is, frankly, all the responsibility of a Prime Minister and a government that lacked the magnanimity to leave well enough  alone. There was a policy that worked, it was scrapped by this government and now we have this unfolding disaster on  our borders.

It is a monumental failure because the first duty of any government is to control the borders of the country. If you can’t  control our borders, you can’t govern the country and I think that’s the conclusion that so many millions of Australians  have come to over this government.

We’re also seeing today that the Government is already canvassing major changes to the carbon tax. We’re scarcely a  month into the operation of this toxic tax and already the Government is arguing amongst itself publicly about how it  should be changed. Look, this is just a bad tax. You can’t fix it, you’ve got to axe it. That’s what we should be doing in the  Parliament in the coming fortnight.

QUESTION:

Will electricity prices be cheaper under an Abbott government?

TONY ABBOTT:

There will be no carbon tax under an incoming Coalition government and the carbon tax is somewhere between 50 and  100 per cent of the price rises that we are currently experiencing and every time the power price goes up, Julia Gillard has  a great big smile on her face because that’s the carbon tax doing precisely its job. The whole point of the carbon tax is to  put up the price of power.

QUESTION:

What will your attitude be to the expert panel’s recommendations on Monday?

TONY ABBOTT:

We don’t need an expert panel to tell us what our policy should be. We’ve had a policy for more than a decade now. It’s  the policy that worked in the past. It’s the policy that will work again in the future. I respect the members of the panel, but  with respect to them, the Coalition did not need to subcontract out to a committee its policy on border protection. Only this  Prime Minister has to subcontract her job out to others.

QUESTION:

So will you consider the Houston report?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ll treat the report with great respect, as we treat the contributions and the inputs of all distinguished people, but we  have a policy and we don’t need anyone to tell us what our policy is. We’ve got one, we’ve had one. It worked in the past,  it will work in the future. It’s the policy we’re sticking with.

Thank you.
