MORRISON NEGLECT CAUSES RESETTLEMENT DELAY



Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has serious questions to answer about his failure to  effectively manage the relationship with Papua New Guinea causing the resettlement  plan for asylum seekers to be mothballed.

In March, Tony Abbott said people would be resettled in PNG within three months.

Today the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Peter O’Neill, announced that a  new policy will need to be prepared regarding the resettlement of asylum seekers in  PNG.

“The new policy will be considered by cabinet after these comprehensive public  awareness and consultations are completed.” - Mr O’Neill, statement - Office of the  Prime Minister, PNG, 19 October 2014.

Maintaining a proactive dialogue with PNG was critical in reaching the Regional  Resettlement Arrangement that Labor signed with Papua New Guinea in July of last  year. By contrast, since coming to power, the Abbott Government has been asleep at  the wheel.

Scott Morrison needs to start taking responsibility for his disastrous handling of this key  agreement, including his failure to actively engage with the Papua New Guinea  Government until after the riot at the Manus Island Facility in February of this year.

His lack of engagement has played a significant role in delaying the resettlement of  asylum seekers.

This agreement cannot continue to be neglected by Scott Morrison and the Abbott  Government.

Labor taking Australia off the table through this agreement has had the biggest impact  on stemming the flow of asylum seeker vessels and saving lives at sea.
