TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SKY PM AGENDA WITH DAVID SPEERS

SUBJECT: FINAL BUDGET OUTCOME

E & O E - PROOF ONLY



SPEERS: Penny Wong, thanks for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.

SPEERS: Now, the deficit has come in at $43.7 billion for the last financial year. That is a  fraction better than the last forecast from the Government about six weeks before the end  of the financial year, but itÃ¢ÂÂs still a lot worse than what you forecast when you put the (2011-12) Budget together, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? You estimated a deficit of $22 billion, itÃ¢ÂÂs now come in at nearly  $44 billion ...

WONG: I think youÃ¢ÂÂre referencing the 2011-12 Budget figure, as opposed to the 2012-13  Budget. Obviously a number of reasons have led to there being a larger-than-anticipated  deficit. One of them is, obviously, whatÃ¢ÂÂs happened in the global economy.

We have had more softness in the global economy than was anticipated, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs  obviously flowed through to revenue. WeÃ¢ÂÂve spoken about that in the MYEFO, and also the  2012-13 Budget. Remember that -

SPEERS: Was it just global factors, or were there -

WONG: One of the things that the Treasurer pointed out in his press conference which is if  you look at the accumulated write downs in revenues over the five years since 2008 and  2008-09, you see about $26 billion of that in the 2011-12 year. So obviously weÃ¢ÂÂve also  been dealing with lower revenues than were anticipated.

SPEERS: So in this one year - in the 2011-12 financial year - the difference between what  you forecast and what you ended up with was almost $22 billion. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs not just because of  revenue write downs.

WONG: YouÃ¢ÂÂre talking about, not our most recent forecasts, but a forecast from some time  ago, and obviously -

SPEERS: When you actually put together the Budget ...

WONG: - in the 2012-13 Budget, we did update those figures.

SPEERS: No, IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about the 2011-12 Budget.

WONG: And those figures have obviously been updated for some of the reasons IÃ¢ÂÂve  outlined to you. Global circumstances, economic circumstances - certainly the global  economy is in a different place to the one you would have imagined, say, 18 months ago.

SPEERS: But the Government is spending more on various things as well than perhaps  youÃ¢ÂÂd anticipated. I want to go through a few specifics. The interest bill on public debt has  grown, from $9.3 billion a year ago to $11.4 billion in the last financial year.

WONG: Actually, the interest bill has come in pretty much where we anticipated in the Final  Budget Outcome. So, itÃ¢ÂÂs broadly -

SPEERS: Where you anticipated in the six weeks before the end of the year?

WONG: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right - which is the most recent figures in the updates. So, the interest bill is,  as I said, about where we anticipated. Having said that, obviously this is one of the reasons  why it is so important to come back to surplus and why the Government remains committed  to doing so.

SPEERS: But we paid last year $11.4 billion in interest on our debt. When is that figure  going to start coming down?

WONG: Well, we need to get back to surplus. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs how you bring your interest payments  down, is to make sure you bring the budget back to surplus, which is why the Government  is committed to doing so. We think itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do, given where our economy is.

But I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important David, just to be fair, we have very strong public finances in this  country. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want you to sort of pick up the Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂre all gonna be roonedÃ¢ÂÂ thing that the  Opposition keeps saying.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen the IMF, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen the global ratings agencies back in AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs strong  public finances. And, as the Treasurer showed today, our debt is at a fraction of the major  advanced economies.

SPEERS: But IÃ¢ÂÂm just trying to establish where our moneyÃ¢ÂÂs going, and this final outcome  isnÃ¢ÂÂt forecast, this is where it was (inaudible).

WONG: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, this is a point in time, what actually happened.

SPEERS: Now, the other cost that we keep hearing a lot about is asylum seekers. IÃ¢ÂÂve  been trying to establish what the cost was last year. More boats arrived, more people  arrived, the immigration bill went up to $2.7 billion, but there are costs on top of that, arenÃ¢ÂÂt

3



there, when it comes to intercepting and rescuing people at sea, processing and housing  them? What is the total cost now?

WONG: We will update our forecasts in MYEFO for immigration -

SPEERS: But IÃ¢ÂÂm talking about last year.

WONG: I donÃ¢ÂÂt have the full breakdown - we do it by functions in the Final Budget  Outcome. But I would be upfront with you; the costs are higher than what we anticipated,  because obviously we didnÃ¢ÂÂt anticipate weÃ¢ÂÂd have the sort of stonewalling we saw in the  Federal Parliament for some time when it came to immigration policy. Obviously arrivals are  higher than we anticipated and -

SPEERS: But you canÃ¢ÂÂt give me a total figure?

WONG: I can get that for you. We report on outcomes - on functions, I should say - rather  than specific programs.

SPEERS: And just to explain what that means…

WONG: Government functions -

SPEERS: So, you donÃ¢ÂÂt report -

WONG: So, immigration, foreign affairs, those sorts of -

SPEERS: Defence?

WONG: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs correct.

SPEERS: So itÃ¢ÂÂs not broken down into specifics?

WONG: ItÃ¢ÂÂs not broken down. And we do report on the major variations. But IÃ¢ÂÂve been  upfront with you on this program - the numbers are higher than we anticipated because we  didnÃ¢ÂÂt anticipate that we would have, as I said, the kind of logjam in the Federal Parliament  than we saw for so long.

SPEERS: The Opposition has accused you of trying to fudge and fiddle in this Budget  Outcome, or in this budget process. They point to a couple of things - the Audit Office  required you to include a $500 million dividend payment from the Reserve Bank in last  financial year rather than in this current financial year, where you wanted it to be included.  Also, a $400 million payment from the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation. You were  trying to include them in this financial year as you try and hit the surplus.

WONG: Actually I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt quite sure what Joe Hockey was talking about there, because,  those accounting changes to which he referred actually only affect the fiscal balance, not  the underlying cash balance.

I thought, I have to say, Mr HockeyÃ¢ÂÂs press conference in response to what is a serious  document - the Final Budget Outcome is a serious document, and something worth

4



responding to - I thought it was a press conference really characterised by bluster and  cheap shots. And, really, if he wants to be taken seriously, he probably has to do a bit  better when it comes to his own costings.

SPEERS: OK, but those two points that heÃ¢ÂÂs making about those payments -

WONG: IÃ¢ÂÂve answered that question.

SPEERS: They didnÃ¢ÂÂt affect…

WONG: The accounting treatment change that is transparently referenced in the Final  Budget Outcome, affects the fiscal balance.

SPEERS: OK, but not -

WONG: Not the underlying cash balance.

SPEERS: And it wonÃ¢ÂÂt impact on the surplus target for this year?

WONG: For this year? For 2012-13?

SPEERS: 2012-13.

WONG: The surplus target in 2012-13 - and we will, IÃ¢ÂÂm sure, have a long discussion about  this, subsequent to the 2012-13 financial year - will be a function of many decisions. And I  think IÃ¢ÂÂve said -

SPEERS: Will these two payments -

WONG: - and IÃ¢ÂÂve said to you itÃ¢ÂÂs wrong to look at a single decision for this target or for the  subsequent surpluses.

The Treasurer today, for example, made very clear to you and other members of the Press  Gallery and to the Australian people that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have to take further savings in  relation to the surplus. So thereÃ¢ÂÂll be a whole range of decisions. He referenced -

SPEERS: I want to get to that. But just to be specific, the two points Joe Hockey raised -  this $500 million dividend from the Reserve Bank, $400 million from the Australian  Reinsurance Pool Corporation - that wonÃ¢ÂÂt affect the surplus for this year?

WONG: What IÃ¢ÂÂm saying is the accounting treatment thatÃ¢ÂÂs referenced is in reference to the  fiscal balance not the underlying cash balance. And IÃ¢ÂÂm making a broader point about  whether itÃ¢ÂÂs a 2012-13 surplus or subsequent surpluses. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre the result of many, many  decisions. And I think itÃ¢ÂÂs wrong to point to a particular decision and say Ã¢ÂÂwell therefore this  is not rightÃ¢ÂÂ.

Joe Hockey, remember, if he handed down a Final Budget Outcome today his would be far  worse because he opposed the Private Health Insurance Rebate, he opposed the closure  of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and who can forget he opposed the Flood Levy and  then put forward a range of botched costings for the Queensland Floods.

SPEERS: Alright, getting back to your Budget -

WONG: But the point is youÃ¢ÂÂre putting to me a proposition from Mr Hockey and IÃ¢ÂÂm saying  this is the proposition that should be put to him: wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt his be worse? WouldnÃ¢ÂÂt his be  worse given the position heÃ¢ÂÂs taken?

SPEERS: LetÃ¢ÂÂs look at this current financial year that weÃ¢ÂÂre in and your efforts to try and get  a surplus. Now the Treasurer said today the fall in commodity prices will hit Government  revenues significantly, which means you will have to cut deeper to protect that forecast  surplus. Is the Budget now tied to commodity prices - the more they fall the deeper you will  have to cut?

WONG: The Australian Budget has always been affected by commodity prices and we  have factored in a fall in the terms of trade over the forward estimates. As the Treasurer  said today, and as weÃ¢ÂÂve said previously, obviously where prices are now is a more  substantial fall. That is referencing what the spot price is. So obviously the longer term price  is more relevant. But the Australian Budget has always been affected by the terms of trade.

SPEERS: But you want that surplus, youÃ¢ÂÂve guaranteed that surplus, so if they keep falling  youÃ¢ÂÂll have to keep cutting elsewhere?

WONG: We think a surplus is the right thing to do and -

SPEERS: Regardless of where the commodity price goes?

WONG: Because of where the economy is. Given the economy is continuing to grow -

SPEERS: But if those commodity prices keep falling -

WONG: - at around long run trend, given the importance of a surplus in a world that is  turbulent. I mean all the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve spoken about that you and IÃ¢ÂÂve spoken about,  about why a 2012-13 surplus is important - and not just 2012-13 but the years beyond -  remain the same. And what the Treasurer is saying, what IÃ¢ÂÂm saying is, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be  harder.

SPEERS: He also said today that the public service has actually grown under LaborÃ¢ÂÂs time  in office. I know youÃ¢ÂÂve been particularly critical recently of the Queensland and New South  Wales governments for cutting public service jobs. Is this a no-go area for the Federal  Government? You wonÃ¢ÂÂt cut public service jobs?

WONG: We actually have made decisions to find efficiencies in the public service and  weÃ¢ÂÂve made them clear in the previous Budget - I think you might have criticised me in an  interview for the efficiency dividend decision. But I think the point is itÃ¢ÂÂs a very different  approach to the approach thatÃ¢ÂÂs being taken by Coalition Premiers. ItÃ¢ÂÂs an approach that  says you should prioritise non-staffing savings first and weÃ¢ÂÂve done that.

WeÃ¢ÂÂve taken about $13 billion worth of savings as a result of things like ICT, coordinated  travel and improved procurement practices. So that is the approach a Labor Government

takes. We have had to make some difficult decisions, thatÃ¢ÂÂs true, but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a very  different approach from the one the Liberal governments are taking in other states.

SPEERS: Can you say there will be no public service job cuts?

WONG: What I can say is what I said when I first announced the increased dividend which  is that our instruction to agencies is to prioritise non-staffing savings and to seek to avoid  forced redundancies, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the agencies have been doing.

SPEERS: “Seek to avoid”, thatÃ¢ÂÂs -

WONG: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂve said. IÃ¢ÂÂm on the public record saying that.

SPEERS: There might have to be some.

WONG: I think if you look at departments, most departments have sought to do exactly  what we asked, which is to look at all the other ways in which they can find savings - a very  different approach to Joe Hockey who will beat his chest about wanting to sack 20,000  people. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a very different approach.

SPEERS: Penny Wong, thank you.

WONG: Good to be with you.
