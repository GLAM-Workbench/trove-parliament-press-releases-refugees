NEW APPROACH TO SELECTING MIGRANTS

From the beginning of next year, Australia will adopt a

new system for selecting people for migration.

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,

said today that the-  new system would be knowm as NUMAS (numerical

multi-factor assessment system) and would come into force on

1 January 1979. Â·

It would replace the present Structured Selection Assessment

System which had been in operation since 1973, while retaining

elements of that system.

"NUMAS will ensure consistency of selection for prospective

migrants wherever they apply in any part of the world," Mr MacKellar said.

'  "It will, be in line with the Government's established policy

of non-discrimination which is applied to all applicants regardless

of their race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic

origin or sex."

Mr MacKellar said one of the main reasons for developing the

new system was to ensure that people selected for migration had the

best possible chance of successful settlement.

"All applicants will be assessed against a uniform set of

factors designed to evaluate their prospects of succeeding

economically in Australia and of making the necessary social and

personal adjustments to life in this country," Mr MacKellar said.

The fact that a prospective migrant had friends or relatives

already settled in Australia would be one factor taken into

consideration because of the obvious advantage this gave in overcoming

settlement problems. Ã¢ÂÂ

"This reflects the Government's wish to give further

emphasis to family reunion,  while maintaining a proper standard

of selectivity," Mr MacKellar said,

"The new system is based on very close study of data

collected in a range of surveys on migrants and their problems.

.  .  "It has been field-tested in seven countries overseas

and modified in the light of information gathered in that testing

"However,  the system will be kept under constant review,

especially during the early days of its implementation.

"Surveys will be undertaken to test its efficiency and

adjustments will be made where necessary,

"The introduction of NUMAS is a major Government initiative

and I am sure it will be welcomed by Australia's ethnic

communities," Mr MacKellar said.

NUMAS is divided into two parts;  the first consisting

of economic factors, the second of personal and settlement

factors.  Those prospective migrants applying independently

will be required to attain a pass score on each of the two

sets of factors before being approved for entry.

Mr MacKellar said some of the factors to be considered

by selection officers, and for which varying numbers of points

would be allocated, would be

,  the work skills possessed by an applicant;

.  the demand for those skills in Australia;

.  the employment record of the applicant and the .

experience and personal qualities applicable to '

proposed employment in Australia;  '

,  whether an applicant had a job waiting in Australia or

had adequate resources to establish his own business;

.  the degree of fluency in English and ability to Â·

communicate in the type of employment followed;

.  an applicant's economic viability and financial assets;

the level of education and literacy;

,  an applicant *  s general approach to migration and

resettlement; and

,  sponsorship or nomination by a relative or friend

in Australia, .

Other factors to be taken into account would be family

unity and an applicant's age,  personal presentation, attitude,

adaptability and initiative,

Hr MacKellar said that.while the new system laid some

emphasis on an applicant having friends or relatives already in

Australia and was consistent with the Government's policy of

family reunion, Australia had much to gain from admitting

independent applicants possessing skills, qualifications or

experience valuable to Australia.

"This new approach to migrant selection will play an .

important part in ensuring that the composition and size of our

migrant intake remains consistent with our capacity, to absorb

newcomers and in ensuring .that those who are accepted have the

ability to settle successfully into our community," Mr MacKellar

added,  ~

NEW BASIS FOR MIGRANT SELECTION .

From 1 January 1979 Australia will employ a new system of

selecting people for migration.

The new selection method is known as NUMAS (numerical

multi-factor assessment system). Ã¢ÂÂ   ’ /  '  .  Â· Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  ' Â· '

j  NUMAS is intended to ensure consistency of selection for  migrants wherever they apply in any part of the world. This

reflects the Government's established policy of non-discrimination

on the grounds of race, colour,  nationality, descent,  national

or ethnic origin or sex.

One of the main reasons for establishing the new system

is to ensure that people selected as migrants have the best

possible chance of successful settlement and that their admission

does not prove detrimental to their own or Australia's interests.

j  Ã¢ÂÂ

Recognising the valuable moral support and assistance

given new migrants by relatives and friends already .established ' Â· " i *'

in Australia,  the new system allocates points on the basis of

sponsorship or nomination. This is consistent with Government's

policy of assisting family reunion. ..

Specific goals which NUMAS has been designed to meet

include:  '  .

.  improving the consistency of migrant selection;

.  ensuring that migrant selection is non-discriminatory;

a providing a screening system which is fair and selective;

.  ensuring that assessments are based on all factors

relevant to successful settlement;

?  .  ensuring that the selection system accurately reflects

an applicant's prospects of successful settlement;

.  assisting in the review of those cases where special

circumstances apply: and .

.  improving supervision of the selection process,  ,

.  The new system, which has been field-tested in seven overseas

countries,  is being kept under continuing review to remedy any

2

anomalies which may arise in its application.

Generally each applicant, and if a family is involved, each

member of the family over 16 years, has to score a minimum number of

points to be accepted for migration.

The minimum points have been set at different levels for

breadwinners and other family members. .

Two sets of factors are involved in assessing potential migrants.

One set covers economic and employment aspects and the other the

personal and settlement side of migration.

Some of the factors are:

.  the standard of work skills possessed by an applicant;

.  the demand for those skills in Australia;

.  the employment record, of the applicant'and the experience

and personal qualities applicable to proposed employment

in,Australia;

.  whether an applicant has a job waiting in Australia or

has adequate resources to establish his own business;

.  the degree of fluency in English and ability to

communicate in the type of employment followed;

.  an applicant's ecoyomic viability and financial assets:

. . .  the standard of education and literacy; ....

.  an applicant's general approach to migration and resettlement;

and " -

‘  .  sponsorship or nomination by a relative or friend in Australia.

Other factors to be taken into account will be family unity,

the age of applicants, personal presentation and attitude,

adaptability and initiative,

Knowledge of English is included in both the economic and

personal assessments because surveys nave shown it to play a major

" role in both employment and the broader aspects of successful settlement

Survey data shows that ability to speak English is a vital factor in

obtaining employment, securing recognition of"qualifications,  industrial

safety, access to -  communityÂ· services and facilities and educational

. .  .  progress. However, the..new system recognises that some people will not .

require fluency in. English in their occupations and this is given due.

'weight in measuring an applicant's ability to communicate in the

employment the applicant: proposes to follow in Australia. :  .

- 3 ~

All applicants for migrant entry will be assessed under

NUMAS; but spouses, dependent children and aged parents of

people resident in Australia will not be required to reach a

minimum number of points in either the economic or the personal

and settlement factors.  Refugees will also be exempt from that

requirement.

Other relatives of residents of Australia who are eligible

under special family reunion policy will generally not be

required to attain a minimum pass score on the economic factors. I  . . . . . ' ÃÂ . .  " . . .  Ã¢ÂÂ

But they will need to show that they will not become a charge

on. public funds if admitted to Australia. They will also be

required to reach a minimum score of 25 points bn personal and

settlement factors. '

'  Independent applicants including those who are nominated

by Australian employers will be required to score a minimum of

30 points on both the economic/employment and personal and

/settlement sets of factors. Applicants who fail marginally on

one set of factors may be accepted if they attain a better than

pass score on the other set.

1  '  Fiances of Australian residents, ,  and applicants eligible,

as patrials, intrepreneurs or self-supporting retirees will not

be'required to attain a minimum pass score on the economic

factors but need to score 30 points for personal and settlement

factors. '  Â·‘
