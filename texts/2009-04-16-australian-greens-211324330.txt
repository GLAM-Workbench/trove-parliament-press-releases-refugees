Greens express sadness over boat tragedy

The Greens have expressed commiserations as injured people from a boat carrying  suspected asylum seekers are transported to hospitals on the Australian mainland.

It has been reported that an explosion occurred on the boat, thought to be carrying  asylum seekers from Afghanistan, while it was being escorted by a Navy patrol boat  to Christmas Island. Three people are reported dead, two missing and many more  injured.

“The Greens are deeply saddened by this tragedy,” Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“We don’t yet know how this explosion happened, or what the circumstances were.

“We are waiting for details to be released by the Federal Government, particularly to  clarify which people were on board and if any were children.

“Our thoughts are with those injured and we hope that those missing are found.

“We hope that the Government can provide all assistance necessary to those in  need.”

Senator Hanson-Young said she would provide further comment when more details  were available.
