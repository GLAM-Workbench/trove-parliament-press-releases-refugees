Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling ABC Radio interview with Marius Benson May 28, 2013

Topics: Labor’s border protection failures / national security breach

Marius Benson

Michael Keenan, good morning.

Michael Keenan

Good morning Marius.

Marius Benson

The arrival numbers aren’t surprising because they are counted as people arriving on Australia’s shores but the disparity  between the departmental forecast and the reality is striking. Who do you blame for that?

Michael Keenan

We blame the Government, as those are their figures. We have consistently said that they have underestimated how many  people are going to be arriving here under their failed border protection policies. They might look to blame someone else but  they need to take total responsibility for these sorts of estimates.

Marius Benson

But these are departmental figures. The estimate came from the Department so are you saying that the Department is simply a  tool of the Government?

Michael Keenan

The Department is answerable to the Government that is the whole point. It is the Labor Party that must take responsibility for  these figures. It is their estimates.

Marius Benson

But aren’t these departmental estimates given by an independent and fearless public service?

Michael Keenan

No, the public service is answerable to the Government of the day. We will find instances where the Government will try and  say that it’s not their responsibility and that somehow the public service is at arm’s length from them but of course the public  service is answerable to the Government of the day. These figures are clearly underestimates about what’s going to happen  under the Labor Party’s border protection failures and that is up to the Labor Party to take responsibility for.

So there is no independent advice going to the Government? The public service is simply an arm of the Labor Party?

Michael Keenan

No the public service is not an arm of the Labor Party but the public service, as is appropriate, is answerable to the  Government of the day and the Government of the day is the one who needs to take responsibility for figures such as these  and also for the policies they pursue.

Marius Benson

This information was given by the Departmental Secretary, Martin Bowles, in a budget hearing yesterday, he was also asked  about some individuals arriving on Australia’s shores with concerns being raised particularly about an Egyptian man, who  arrived here despite having an Interpol red notice, which is a high level of security, and a Sri Lankan murderer also being  amongst arrivals. Now Martin Bowles said that he could assure everyone in that estimates committee that these people were  known about and that it was damaging for this to be discussed in public. Do you accept that?

Michael Keenan

No I don’t. What has happened here is very concerning and the Australian people are actually owed an explanation. We have  had people arrive in the country who should not have been detained in the manner in which they were detained. In particular  the Egyptian you mentioned was subject to the highest level of Interpol notice and that means that they take you very seriously  as a criminal. He was put into Inverbrackie, which is a very low security detention facility that is surrounded by what is  essentially a pool fence. Now that is clearly not appropriate and the Australian people need to understand why that is the case  and be assured that it won’t happen again.

Marius Benson

Just going back to the numbers themselves. The issue of asylum seekers has been devastating politically for Labor. In all  likelihood, in 15 weeks, this will be an issue that you the Coalition will be responsible for. What is the first thing you do on  arrivals?

Michael Keenan

Well firstly we a certainly not taking an election victory for granted. What we need to do if we are successful is to send the  message very clearly to people smugglers that there has been a change of administration in Canberra and we will no longer  tolerate their activity. That will be very important because we need to let them know that we are deadly serious about closing  down their evil trade and we will implement the suite of policies that will close them down as one of the highest priorities if we  were to form government.

Marius Benson

Tony Abbott said back in February that he would stop the boats within weeks, which has since been abandoned. What is a  realistic expectation of what you can do?

Michael Keenan

We will move from day one to tackle this problem and we believe that our efforts will have an effect very quickly but I don’t think  it is useful to put an estimate on it. But we will move from day one and our policies will have an immediate effect from day one  as they have done in the past.
