TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be out here in the electorate of Macarthur with Russell Matheson. I want to thank Narelle and  Joel Matthews for making Margie and me and Russell so welcome into their home. I think that this is typical  of the hundreds of thousands of Australian households who are struggling to find effective and affordable  child care that suits the realities of their working life. There are hundreds of thousands of Australian  families, possibly millions of Australian families, whose working lives are not well suited by the standard  institutional pattern of child care.

Child care is still predominantly an 8 till 6 institutional operation and this doesn’t suit increasing numbers of  Australian families. So it’s very important that we try to find more flexible and more effective ways of child  care support. That’s why I have committed the Coalition to an urgent Productivity Commission inquiry into  this matter and I can’t understand the relentless negativity of the Prime Minister on this. If the Productivity  Commission is good enough to inquire into disabilities, if it’s good enough to inquire into aged care, it’s  certainly good enough to give us a better way forward on the whole question of child care.

People of this area have a real problem with cost of living. People in this area are very conscious of the need  for more, not less, economic opportunities. We have the Business Council of Australia today releasing a  major new report talking about the increasing impediments to doing business in Australia and of course the  carbon tax is just going to make everything so much worse. The costs for families are going to go up and up  and up and the cost for businesses are going to go up and up and up and that just makes the security of  employment go down and down and down and that is a real problem, particularly for the aspirational people  of Western Sydney.

Finally, can I just say that every day it just gets worse and worse and worse with the Health Services Union.  This union looks more and more like a corrupt boys club. The only person in the labour movement in  Australia who is oblivious to the problems here is Prime Minister Gillard. We’ve got Graham Richardson  who sees the problem, we’ve got Paul Howes who sees the problem, we’ve got the ACTU that sees the  problem and has suspended the union. The only person who sees no evil, hears no evil is the Prime Minister  herself. Well, it’s just not good enough. She can’t wash her hands of this. Fair Work Australia is her

creation. Craig Thomson is her member and if it’s good enough for the ACTU to go without the Health  Services Union’s money, why is the Prime Minister still clinging to the Health Services Union’s vote in the  Parliament? She is clinging to it like a drowning person will cling to a life rope. Well, the fact of the matter  is we need to see finally a little bit of political integrity on this matter from the Prime Minister.

Russell?

RUSSELL MATHESON:

Thanks, Tony. I’d just like to thank Tony and Margie for coming out to south-western Sydney once again.  It’s something that the people of Macarthur really, really do appreciate. I know that nearly seven percent of  our working population travel between one hour and three hours to work each day. So, our young families in  Macarthur are definitely looking for flexibility in their child care services. I don’t understand - like Tony has  said - the negativity from the Prime Minister. All we are asking for an inquiry, an investigation, from the  Productivity Commission and it's something that’s worthwhile doing and the people of Macarthur would  really, really appreciate that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Any questions?

QUESTION:

Tony, what do you say to the Prime Minister who says that you should allow proper processes to take place  in the Fair Work investigation that is currently underway?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don’t believe that any proper process could take more than three years and end up with the relevant  prosecuting body saying that the work in its current form is completely useless. I mean, that can’t be proper  process; that’s either got to be - as Peter Faris said last week - utter incompetence, or it’s got to be a  deliberate protecting of Craig Thomson and Julia Gillard.

QUESTION:

She was saying that under the Howard years, you supported John Howard when he was taking heat over  investigations into other Liberal members facing investigations into parliamentary entitlements and she said  you should allow the same thing to happen now.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don’t think there has ever been anything approaching this. We’ve got a member of the Gillard  Government against whom very, very serious allegations have been made; very credible allegations have  been made involving the misuse of hundreds of thousands of dollars of low paid union members’ money -  allegations that he spent hundreds of thousands on election campaigning, that he spent thousands on the high  life including prostitution services. This has to be investigated. The guilty parties have to be identified and  charges should be laid. Crime has to be punished and there is no way that there hasn’t been something  deeply improper happen here and I can’t understand why the Prime Minister persists in trying to wash her  hands of this. She is the only person in the labour movement in Australia who still insists that nothing  untoward has gone wrong with Craig Thomson and the Health Services Union.

QUESTION:

Tony, in an opinion piece in today’s Herald, Kathy Jackson says that she warned the Labor Party not to  preselect Craig Thomson in the seat of Dobell. What do you make of those comments?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I think that Kathy Jackson has been a very credible whistleblower here. I think that it’s to the  enormous discredit of some people in the labour movement that they are now trying to blacken her name. I  think that what she has done has been heroic and I think that what she’s said today needs to be taken very,  very seriously and I would like to know exactly who she warned inside the Labor Party and exactly what  action, if any, was taken in response to those warnings.

QUESTION:

She’s also calling for the whole national executive to stand down or to be dumped while these investigations  are taking place, but the boss of the HSU won’t agree to those requests. Does she have a point? Should the  national executive of the HSU stand aside?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think a union such as this - which is exposed as, at best, a corrupt boys club - does need to be  completely overhauled and if Kathy Jackson thinks that’s the best way forward, I think that is a view that we  have to respect.

QUESTION:

But do you think that the HSU executive should be disbanded?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not going to get into detailed commentary on what should happen inside the executive of a  particular union, but I do make this fundamental point. Unions which have been exposed as completely  abusing their members’ trust and their members’ money do need to be cleaned up and they need to be  cleaned up urgently and the Prime Minister cannot be the only person anywhere in Australia in the labour  movement who thinks that there is no problem with the Health Services Union and no problem with Craig  Thomson. Why is the Prime Minister alone amongst everyone in the labour movement in pretending that  this doesn’t stink to high heaven?

QUESTION:

What do you make of Craig Thomson’s constant denials that he has done anything wrong, though?  He’s  been fairly vocal in maintaining his innocence in the whole matter, especially last week he was virtually  coming out every day when he spoke to the media he was maintaining his innocence in this situation.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, on the admitted facts, he’s got a problem.  It was his credit card, it was his driver’s licence and until  that can be satisfactorily explained away - preferably on oath in a court of justice - he’s got a huge, huge  problem and as long as he’s got a problem, the Prime Minister who is protecting him at every turn - she has  a problem, too.

QUESTION:

The Prime Minister also said this morning in her radio interview that she thinks that if a budget surplus is  achieved, that the Reserve Bank will then lower interest rates and that’ll help alleviate pain on families.  What are your thoughts on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that it’s very important that a budget surplus be achieved, but Labor has been much better at  predicting a budget surplus than actually delivering one.  What we have had from this government so far are  the four biggest budget deficits in Australia’s history and if a budget surplus is achieved on Budget night, it  will be a Claytons budget surplus - a surplus that has only been achieved by fiddling the books and inflating  the estimates. That’s my strong expectation. The other point I should make is that if a budget surplus is  achieved, it will be because this government is more interested in being tough on you than in being tough on  itself and its own wasteful and unnecessary expenditures.

QUESTION:

And, what do you say, were you surprised that your sister decided to come out in the newspaper, so to speak,  talking about her lesbian relationship?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I deeply respect my sister.  She’s had some very difficult issues to grapple with over the last few  years. I think she has handled them with courage and with authenticity but I think that from this point on her  privacy should be respected and I’m not going to be making any further comment about it.

QUESTION:

And on the Productivity Commission report, have you spoken to the Productivity Commission about doing a  report into child care?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the Productivity Commission is a well-respected arm of government and I have absolutely no doubt  that the Productivity Commission would be only too happy to undertake such an inquiry given that it is such  an important issue for millions of Australian families and given that it does have an enormous impact on the  productivity of the mothers of Australia.  I mean, the mothers of Australia should have a real choice.  The  mothers of Australia should be economic assets as well as social assets and I think if the mothers of  Australia want to be bigger economic contributors they should have the opportunity to do so and that’s why  it’s so important that the Productivity Commission should be involved.

QUESTION:

And Mr Abbott just before you go, the asylum seekers that are off the Indonesian coast. What should happen  there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, if we didn’t have the boats, we wouldn’t have the problem and this is the problem: if you can’t stop  the boats, you can’t stop the tragedies, and as long as the boats keep coming - because this government has  effectively provided the people smugglers with a business model - as long as the boats keep coming, these  problems will persist.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what is your stance on the Chinese asylum seeker boat on its way to New Zealand that’s  currently moored in Darwin?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, it does go to show the importance of effective border protection policies and if we want to stop  the boats and protect our borders, it’s clear what we need to do. We need to, first of all, have rigorous  offshore processing; we have to have temporary protection visas; we have to have the option of turning  boats back where it is safe to do so and we have got to have mandatory detention.  It’s only because New  Zealand lacks mandatory detention that that boat is apparently headed there.

Thank you.
