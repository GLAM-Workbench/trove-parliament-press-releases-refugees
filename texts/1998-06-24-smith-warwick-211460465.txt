CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AGED CARE PROJECTS RECEIVE $400,000

Â

Frail elderly Australians from Italy, Greece, Macedonia, Malta and 
Indo-China w ill have better choice and access to residential 
aged care services following $400,000 funding to eight ethnic aged service 
organisations in New South Wales and Victoria.

Â

“The grants will help 
to build stronger links between ethnic communities and aged care services,” 
Federal Family Services Minister Warwick Smith said today.

Â

“This initiative shows 
the Federal Government is providing real services for the diversity 
of needs of frail older Australians.”

Â

In New South Wales, 
the organisations being funded are the Greek Welfare Centre, NSW Italian 
Association of Assistance, Macedonian Australian Welfare Association 
and Italian Social Welfare Organisation (Wollongong).

Â

In Victoria, the Italian 
Association of Assistance, Maltese Community Council of Victoria, Australian 
Greek Welfare Society and Indo-Chinese Elderly Refugees Association 
have received funding.

Â

“Improving the choice 
and access to residential aged care for frail older people from diverse 
cultural and linguistic backgrounds is a key activity under the Government’s 
Ethnic Aged Care Framework.

Â

“People from diverse 
cultural and linguistic backgrounds represent 14 per cent of all people 
in Australia aged over 70 years. By early next century they are estimated 
to represent 25 per cent of the total population over the age of 70.

Â

“The funded organisations 
provide a valuable service by informing people of the new opportunities 
that exist for ethnic communities under the aged care reforms,” Mr 
Smith said.

Â

These grants complement 
a number of Government initiatives, including the development of a National 
Ethnic Aged Care Training Strategy, Best Practice Workshops and a Training 
Package for Dementia Care for People From Diverse Cultural and Linguistic 
Backgrounds.
