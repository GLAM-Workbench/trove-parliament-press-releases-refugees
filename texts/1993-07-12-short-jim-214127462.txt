CONTINUING DEPRESSED ECONOMY AFFECTS MIGRANT INTAKE

The total fall in new arrivals in the March quarter is clearly related to the  continuing depressed economic conditions in Australia.

If there had not been . a large increase in new arrivals in the

Refugee/Humanitarian & Special Assistance categories, the 36% fall in total  arrivals would have been much greater.

Even more significant is the big increase in the number of permanent departures  from Australia during the March quarter - to the fourth highest figure since the  March quarter of 1975.

It is little wonder that with a million Australians unemployed as a result of the  Keating Government's policies, long term residents of Australia, including many  who were born here, are leaving to seek employment and a better economic  future in other countries.

Many of the departures are people with skills and related qualities whose loss is  a significant blow to Australia. The loss to the persons concerned in both  economic and human terms is also heavy,

The Coalition has consistently advocated a lower level of net migration while  Australia languishes in the economic rut into which the Government's economic  mismanagement and incompetence has dumped us. However, having a situation  which virtually encourages people to leave Australia for their economic well-being

is not the way to go.

The tragedy is that this Government is clearly bereft of ideas and policies to pull  Australia out of the economic malaise it has created.
