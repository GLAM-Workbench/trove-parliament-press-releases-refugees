DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO EGYPT

I have today announced the appointment of Robert Alan Newton as Australian Ambassador to the Arab Republic of Egypt, with non-resident accreditation to the Republic of the Sudan, the Arab  Republic  of  Syria  and  the  Republic  of  Tunisia.   Mr  Newton  will  replace  Ms  Victoria Owen  who  has  been  Ambassador  since  June  1998.   Mr  Newton  is  expected  to  take  up  his appointment in January 2002.

Australia values its strong relationship with Egypt.  Australia recognises Egyptâ€™s central role in regional political developments and attaches importance to dialogue with Egypt on present and  emerging  challenges  in  the  Middle  East.   Australia  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to assisting efforts to bring peace to the region and in support of this, is continuing to provide military personnel  to  the  Multinational  Force  and  Observers  located  in  the  Sinai.   Australia values its dialogue with Egypt on a range of multilateral issues including WTO matters, arms control and disarmament.

Two-way trade between Australia and Egypt amounted to A$615 million in 2000-01.  Egypt is a  substantial  buyer  of  Australian  wheat  and  is  an  important  market  for  a  range  of  other Australian exports including live cattle, fresh vegetables and dairy products.
