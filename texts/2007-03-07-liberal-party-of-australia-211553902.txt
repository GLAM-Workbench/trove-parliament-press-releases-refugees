Australia Provides Support for the Displaced in the Asia Pacific

Australia will provide over $14.4 million to help conflict-affected populations in the  Asia Pacific.

Australia's International Refugee Fund will support seven new projects that help  reduce the adverse impacts of crises in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, East Timor and on the  Thai-Burma border.

The Fund will provide over $3.5 million to UNICEF, to upgrade school facilities and  teaching in Sri Lanka; supply water, vaccinations and mine education for families in  Afghanistan; and provide protection services for vulnerable refugee children on the  Thai-Burma border.

A further $7.8 million will be provided to UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee  agency, for emergency assistance to displaced populations in Sri Lanka; return,  reintegration and protection in Afghanistan; and to fund protection activities in  refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border.

We will also provide over $3 million to the International Organization for Migration  to support internally displaced people in East Timor.

The International Refugee Fund has provided $74.6 million in assistance since its  establishment in 2002.

The Fund operates as part of the humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs of  Australia's international aid agency, AusAID, to help improve conditions, alleviate  suffering, and maintain the dignity of people displaced by conflict and natural  disasters.
