INTERVIEW WITH KIEREN GILBERT, AM AGENDA, SKY NEWS

MONDAY, 29 JULY 2013



KIERAN GILBERT:    First, though, to the issue of asylum seekers and the first group  is set to be sent to PNG under the new arrangements within the  week. On that and other matters I spoke to the Immigration  Minister Tony Burke a short time ago.

Tony Burke, thanks very much for your time.

TONY BURKE:          Good to be with you.

KIERAN GILBERT:    The first group as asylum seekers to be sent to PNG under the  new arrangements will be sent this week. Is that correct?

TONY BURKE:          Well, I've always said they'll be sent when the health checks are  complete. The health checks take in the order of about two  weeks so, you know, that two week period that I originally  flagged would take us through to Friday.

KIERAN GILBERT:    And the cargo, the various pieces of infrastructure, has this  started arriving?

TONY BURKE:          That's right. That's on its way now, so that's been transported  across first to Port Moresby and then by plane between Port

Moresby and Manus Island, and that's where, I've said the whole  way through, we are capable there of rapid expansion and rapid  expansion of the facilities at Manus is exactly what's happening.

KIERAN GILBERT:    So we should expect that the first people to be sent to Manus  will happen by the end of the week?

TONY BURKE:          Well, I've always said the test isn't an arbitrary deadline. The  test is health checks. In the ordinary course, health checks take  about two weeks.

KIERAN GILBERT:    Well, two weeks is Friday.

TONY BURKE:          You get some people where health checks can take longer, some  people where it's a briefer period of time, but I'm not working to  a deadline of how quickly I need to get people across. My  deadline is when health checks are complete, people can go  across.

KIERAN GILBERT:    There are 1350 asylum seekers that have arrived since the PNG  deal was announced. The Manus capacity's getting well and truly  tested, even with that number, isn't it?

TONY BURKE:          Be in no doubt about what we are doing now to allow rapid  expansion at Manus. Anyone who's wanted to set a limit on, you  know, this is how many people you can take or this is how many  people you can get across or different forms of limits is exactly  what the people smuggling operators would love. They'd love to  think they could overwhelm our capacity. They can't. Capacity  will increase as required.

KIERAN GILBERT:    You can expand quickly, but doesn't the haste with which you're  putting it together raise further doubts about conditions?

TONY BURKE:          No. The - what weâ€™re doing there with the rapid expansion is  tents and marquees. Now there's already some fixed structures  there when I went and had a look last week, so they'll be used as  well. Some of the areas that have been tents and marquees for  quite some time will start to rotate through and we'll have fixed  structures gradually being put in place there as well. So, as well  as the rapid expansion of the temporary accommodation, we're  still methodically adding permanent accommodation there as  well.

KIERAN GILBERT:    Now, I know you don't want to accept arbitrary deadlines, but  how soon would - before women and children will be sent to  PNG, in rough terms? Weeks or months?

TONY BURKE:          Look, if we're talking months I don't think we're talking many  months. The facilities to make sure that it's right for family  groups, you need to do a few things. Importantly, you need to  make sure that the family groups are being kept well away from  where you've got single adult males. So some of the facilities go  to education and actually quality facilities. Some of it goes to  physical location and separation from other groups.

KIERAN GILBERT:    Mr Burke, the flow of boats has not abated. Do you see this as  people smugglers rushing people onto boats as quickly as  possible before the policy kicks in in full effect or are they, like  you alluded to earlier, trying to overwhelm it?

TONY BURKE:          We always said people would test our resolve. Now they're  doing exactly what we said they would, and they'll discover that  we're going to do exactly what we said we would, and that is  we've made clear that if you come by boat without a visa now,  you will not be settled in Australia. We're going to follow  through on that, and each stage of the timing and the process  that we said we would follow is exactly how things had been  going.

KIERAN GILBERT:    Have you got any advice that the message is getting through to  asylum seekers, transit countries?

TONY BURKE:          Yeah we do, and that advice - obviously the full advice channels  I can't refer to, but even the media on the ground have no  trouble finding people who are saying now they're going to go  through the UNHCR process, United Nations process. Other  people smugglers effectively shrugging their shoulders and  saying well, they made money for a while but it's probably over  now. The media have had no trouble reaching the same  individuals where we're getting our information. It'll be different  for different cohorts and different groups of people, and some  people will have a view that they think they'll get away with it.  Well, we needed to draw a line here. The moment we had the  cooperation from Papua New Guinea, it was time to announce it  and start implementing it.

KIERAN GILBERT:    Has there been progress with other countries in the region for  possibly replicating the PNG deal?

TONY BURKE:          We're not going out there selling it to different countries.  Certainly, the agreement with Papua New Guinea contemplates  that other nations may choose to become involved. Obviously  when I was in Nauru last week, most of my attention there had  to deal with reconstructing and rebuilding what has been  destroyed during a horrific ride.

KIERAN GILBERT:    I want to turn your attention now to the heartbreaking image of  the child's coffin on the front page of a number of our  newspapers this morning. It's a reminder of the terrible cost in  this area, isn't it, and the stakes in this area.

TONY BURKE:          Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is and I'm the minister and my view is always  when you're the minister for something, you take responsibility  for what happens on your watch and this is where some people  wanted to characterise it as though we're thumping the table

and trying to show how tough we are or it's a shift to the right or  something like that. No one should pretend for a minute that  there is a lack of compassion in wanting to stop people drowning  at sea, in wanting to make sure the most needy people in the  world are chosen by the UN, not by smugglers, and [audio skips]  to have a pathway whereby Australia can help more refugees,  not fewer.

And I won't accept the argument that's put out there quite a bit

by some that somehow this is away from what you would expect  and what you would want if you believe in the values of the  Labor Party.

KIERAN GILBERT:    It shows just how much is at stake in your policy area. The  names of those who have died in asylum seeker tragedies are  not normally released. Will you consider doing that to provide  the human face to the tragedies?

TONY BURKE:          There are issues there which specifically relate to families as  well, so I'm not going to give you an answer straight up on that. I  also think it's fair to say at this point Australians are not missing  and, you know, there's no lack of understanding of the exact  human cost of what we've been seeing in the Indian Ocean. The  important images that I think the Department has done the right  thing in getting out is also showing the images of people when  they've been told that they're going to Papua New Guinea, not  to Australia.

That's the image that I want to make sure gets out because that's

the image that says to people smugglers no longer have a  product to sell. The significance of not settling people in  Australia is that there is no longer a reason to get on a boat to  Australia.

KIERAN GILBERT:    The Government's finalising an economic statement to be  released later this week. Your colleague, Mr Bowen, has

reiterated the plan to return to surplus by 2016-17. Do you  recommit to having the full costs of the PNG deal in this  economic update?

TONY BURKE:          The economic update will, by definition, have to deal with the  new arrangement that's been put in place. Now, there will  always be the limit in these sorts of figures that you're talking  about something that the funding has to vary based on the  number of people who test our resolve. My preference for this  policy is always that as few people as possible put their lives at  risk in the Indian Ocean.

However, many choose to take that risk, the pathway for them

ultimately will be the same. They'll be transported to Papua New  Guinea, they'll be processed, and if they have a successful claim,  they'll be settled there.

KIERAN GILBERT:    Mr Burke, thanks for your time.

TONY BURKE:          Good to be with you.
