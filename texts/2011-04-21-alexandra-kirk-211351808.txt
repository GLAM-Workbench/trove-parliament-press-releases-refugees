E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

The Opposition Leader is speaking here to Alexandra Kirk.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I want a fair go for people with mental illness and that’s what they haven’t had over the last few years.  We’ve got even GetUp! saying that mental health needs an additional $2 billion as a matter of urgency and  along with the $1.5 billion that the Coalition committed to extra mental health beds and extra mental health  centres at the last election, the additional $430 million that the Coalition would commit which I announce  today will supplement that with better employment services, more research and better professional  development.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

Most of your plan is targeted to disability support pensioners and the unemployed with mental illness. How  many more people do you think you could get a job if that help was there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the answer is we can’t precisely say, but we do know that there are many people out of work  who could be in work if they had better services and we know that there are many people who are working  now who could work far more effectively with better mental health services. Just look at my colleague  Andrew Robb for instance. Andrew was dogged for years with a form of depression and I think anyone who  knows Andrew and works with Andrew would say that he is a transformed man since getting the treatment  that he needed.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

Well, what bang for the buck do you think you would get?

TONY ABBOTT:

This isn’t a savings measure, not at all, Alex. This is a spending measure. But certainly if you invest  intelligently in health, including mental health, over time you have a far more productive society. It’s no  accident that over the last fifty years Australia’s net wealth per head has quadrupled at a time when our  health spend has gone from five to ten per cent of GDP because that health spend is an investment in a more  productive society.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

How serious do you think mental health problems are amongst disability support pensioners and the  unemployed?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if you look at the stats about a third of people on the disability pension are there because of various  forms of mental illness. So better support for people with mental health certainly should get a lot of people  back into the workforce and that’ll be good for the economy, but it’ll be extremely good for their mental  health because the six experts who reported to the nation back in March and on whose work much of today’s  announcement is based, they recognised that fulfilling work is very important to people’s mental health and  work - whether it’s rocket science or just fairly humdrum work - is very important to giving people a sense  of self and a sense of belonging to our society.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

When she became Prime Minister Julia Gillard said mental health would be a second term priority for her  Government and the Government’s expected to deliver on that promise in next month’s budget. You’re  getting in first, pre-empting the Government. Do you really think that you’ll get any credit for that political  strategy?

TONY ABBOTT:

All I can say is that this is a long term commitment of mine. When I was the health minister we brought  down the largest ever mental health initiative, including much, much wider access to psychologist  consultations on Medicare. We dramatically expanded the range of treatment that was available to people  through their GPs for mental health problems. Then at the election we took a $1.5 billion boost to mental  health which was widely praised by the mental health experts. So, for me this is just a continuing evolution  of a long term commitment.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

But the timing is deliberate, isn’t it, just before the budget?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s appropriate. It’s appropriate. I mean, I think that we should build on the commitment that we made  in government and in the last term and that’s what we’re doing.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

Asylum seekers are in the news again today. One of the mental health experts you listen to and cite as an  influence for today’s announcement is Professor Pat McGorry. He’s described immigration detention centres  as factories for producing mental illness. Your plan doesn’t extend to asylum seekers. You discount that  argument of his?

TONY ABBOTT:

And we have a strong plan to stop the boats and that, Alex, is the only way that we can get people out of  immigration detention.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

And that’s your mental health plan for asylum seekers?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if you want to stop people having mental health problems in immigration detention you’ve got to stop  illegal immigration and that’s what our plan is there to do.

ALEXANDRA KIRK:

And once they’re here and in immigration detention what then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they get the range of treatment that’s available to people there and as people who visit Villawood  know there are pretty good health services available to people there.
