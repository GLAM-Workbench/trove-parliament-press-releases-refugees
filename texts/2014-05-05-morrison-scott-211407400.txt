THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



MEDIA RELEASE

REPORT MUST BE RELEASED WITHOUT DELAY

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has said  serious allegations relating to conduct at the Manus Island Regional Processing  Centre reported today by Fairfax Media highlight the urgent need for the Abbott  Government to release its report into the incidents that occurred on Manus  Island between 16-18 February and resulted in the tragic death of Reza Berati.

It is critical this report is released without delay by Immigration Minister Scott  Morrison so that we understand exactly what is taking place at the Manus Island  Regional Processing Centre, and importantly what factors contributed to the  violence that broke out in February.

We need to know what happened leading up to the violence in February, to  make sure we can put in place whatever safeguards are necessary to prevent it  happening again.

The report into the events 16-18 February at the Manus Island Regional  Processing Centre was due to be delivered to Minister Morrison by the end of  April. There can be no delay in making the full report public - the Australian  public have a right to know what is going on at the Australian funded facility.

We must ensure that asylum seekers are being provided with safe  accommodation and treated in a humane and dignified manner.
