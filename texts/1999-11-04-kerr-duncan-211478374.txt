Ruddock announces failure of Howard and Max 
Moore-Wllton

Coastal Surveillance Taskforce

Â

“Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock’s announcement of a third 
Gover nment inquiry into illegal boar arrivals is an admission 
that the Prime Minister’s recent Inquiry was a failure,” said Duncan 
Kerr, Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs.

Â

“In June this year, the Prime Minister’s Coastal 
Surveillance Task Force, headed by Max Moore-Wilton and including senior 
Defence and Security personnel, published its report.

Â

“The Report subsumed an earlier inquiry commissioned 
by Customs Minister, Senator Vanstone and headed by retired Air Vice 
Marshal Heggen.

Â

“The measures contained in Max Moore-Wilton’s 
recommendations and adopted by the Prime Minister were hailed as the 
answer to halt the tide of boar people.

Â

“Nearly 1300 illegals have arrived by sea alone 
since the Report.

Â

“In announcing this new inquiry, Mr Ruddock has 
effectively declared the Prime Minister’s Inquiry a waste of time 
and money; and Max Moore-Wilton’ s recommendations now up for review. 
On Monday, a boat carrying 352 boat people landed on Ashmore Reef. This 
is the largest such arrival on our shores.

Â

“The fact that boat people can choose where to dock 
is a serious issue of national security. The problem is compounded as 
news of successful landings is sent back and we are seen as a soft target.

Â

“Senator Vanstone is the Minister responsible for 
coastal surveillance. She has been missing from this debate since the 
Heggen Inquiry announcement.

Â

“Of course the Government would rather treat this 
as an immigration issue. It provides them with easy scapegoats - those 
being exploited by people smugglers.

Â

“If our border security was adequate, fewer and 
fewer boats would choose Australia as a target and there would not be 
the massive illegal immigration problem that has caused us to build 
a tent city at Curtin in WA to house recent arrivals.

Â

“Frontline border control requires an integrated 
approach. That is why the Opposition is calling on the Government to 
examine the option of establishing a properly resourced and dedicated 
force charged with protecting our borders - an Australian Coastguard.”
