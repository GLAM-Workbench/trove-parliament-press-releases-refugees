SPEERS:

Wayne Swan, thanks for your time. Surveys consistently in the recent  months have shown that business and consumers are pessimistic, but  today's figures show businesses and households seem to be spending  again. Has confidence now returned to the Australian economy?

TREASURER:

Well the consumption figures in the National Accounts have consumption  at about trend, at about 3 per cent for the year. Now if you listened to a  lot of the public commentary or perhaps you take notice of a number of  the surveys, you get the impression there is some form of consumption  strike going on. There clearly isn't, but there has been a shift in what  people have been doing. People have been spending more on services  and they've spending less on goods. And it's also true that people have  had rising incomes and they've also been lifting their savings. They are  simply not spending in a way in which they may have spent prior to the  Global Financial Crisis. I think retailers got used to people spending a lot  more in their stores so consumers are out there saving a bit more but  they are still spending, spending around trend levels and the consequence  of that is that has made a very significant contribution to growth in these  figures today.

SPEERS:

You call it a patchwork economy though, and clearly one area that is  struggling is tourism and you've pointed to that. Exports overall are down  half a per cent in today's figures but tourism in particular, short term  overseas departures are up nearly 9 per cent?

TREASURER:

Well first of all can I say exports are going up, although they have been  held back because we still have got some problems in the supply chain in  terms of coal. But what we actually saw reflected in the figures was that  there was a strong burst of imports and we're seeing that reflected in the  figures. So exports are going strongly and investment in the export  sector, the resources sector, is also very strong and that is one of the  strengths of the economy, and strong business investment.

SPEERS:

What about tourism?

TREASURER:

I think in tourism they are doing it tough because of the patchwork  economy. The elevated dollar really hurts those people that are trade  exposed and it particularly hurts the tourism industry and what we've  seen in the figures is this huge jump in the June quarter of people going  overseas and spending their money on overseas holidays...

SPEERS:

(Inaudible)

TREASURER:

...so I take this opportunity to urge Australians to holiday at home.

SPEERS:

But that's not enough with the dollar where it is. Obviously the temptation  is there to go abroad. What can the Government do to help tourism?

TREASURER:

Well what the Government can do to help tourism and all of those sectors  that are affected by the patchwork economy, which is caused particularly  by a high dollar, is to make sure we do everything we can do to make  those businesses more competitive. That's why the Government for  example is so intent on using the revenue from the MRRT to give a  company tax cut, to give a very big company tax cut to small business.  That's not the only thing we can do, it will depend upon the sectors, but  these are structural forces on our industries that we need to recognise are  causing great pain in those sectors and I do recognise that.

SPEERS:

The cost of labour in today's figures continues to rise and yet productivity  has been falling. Now some argue that this productivity issue needs to be  tackled by reforming industrial relations. Even some of Labor's friends  here, Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group, is saying individual  contracts should be brought back. What's wrong with individual contracts  if there is still a no disadvantage test?

TREASURER:

Well first of all, let's look at the figures in terms of what is happening with  wages. Basically wages are growing around trend. There's nothing  particularly unusual about what we are seeing in terms of our wage data  at the moment. There is a separate debate is what we need to do as a  country to lift productivity overall. Now there are some people out there  who think the way you lift productivity is simply to rip away wages and  working conditions and go back to some sort of WorkChoices style  approach. The Government completely rejects that.

SPEERS:

What about having a no-disadvantage test for individual contracts? Well  that's what she's arguing and that's what others are arguing What's  wrong with that?

TREASURER:

Well we'll talk to industry and responsible people in industry about the  issues they have and their plans for lifting productivity, but I want to  make this point: the point is that when it comes to Australia's productivity  challenge, the challenge for us is to make sure that we train and educate  and skill our workforce - and that's what the Government has been intent  on doing from day one. The centrepiece of our last Budget was a huge  skills package, not only to train the workforce but also to lift labour force  participation.

SPEERS:

But what about individual contracts, are you open to considering them?

TREASURER:

No I'm not open to going back to a WorkChoices style arrangement.

SPEERS:

No, but with a no-disadvantage test?

TREASURER:

Well, the Fair Work Act, we've put it in place, we did that in consultation  with the industry. From time to time there'll be some people in the  industry who will say to me or to other Ministers that they'd like to revisit  sections of the Act. We will deal with that in the way in which any  responsible government deals with it. We've got a review of the Fair Work  Act happening now, but we are not in the business of going back to some  WorkChoices style arrangement where people's basic wages and working  conditions are ripped away.

SPEERS:

Which is not what they're arguing. They're not arguing for that.

TREASURER:

No, well they're not arguing for the Fair Work Act to be overturned either.  Some are, some aren't. We'll have a responsible conversation about it.

SPEERS:

But individual contracts are out?

TREASURER:

Well, I don't see them as being as being a panacea for productivity if  that's the point that they are making. I don't happen to agree that that is  a panacea for productivity. Some of them do. I respect their view. I just  respectfully disagree.

SPEERS:

How confident are you looking at today's figures now about returning the  Budget to surplus next financial year?

TREASURER:

Well, there's no doubt that returning the Budget to surplus in 2012-13  has been made more difficult by all of the events that we've seen unfold  over the last three or four months, but the Government is determined to  bring the Budget back to surplus in 2012-13.

SPEERS:

Is it going to happen?

TREASURER:

Well, we're determined to bring it back in 2012-13. We acknowledge that  that task has been made all the more difficult by events in the global

economy which impact upon global growth, impact upon our growth, and  therefore impact upon our Budget. But we're determined to do that  because we think it is really important there is very clear and consistent  fiscal policy.

SPEERS:

Do you think it will happen?

TREASURER:

Well, we're determined to bring it back.

SPEERS:

Because it went from a commitment to a target to something you're  working towards.

TREASURER:

That is just the sort of debate that's been run largely by the Opposition.  The fact is, I've been clear, all of our Ministers have been clear, the Prime  Minister has been clear that we're determined to bring it back to surplus  in 2012-13, but we've made the commonsense observation that that task  has got harder. People then come to me and say 'what if' - and they give  a whole lot of hypothetical examples - 'what if global growth does this or  that?', and I say to them that we've got a proven track record of dealing  with global financial and economic instability and if that were to happen,  we'd deal with it in a responsible way, which is the responsible answer.

SPEERS:

It's also made harder by the decision by the New South Wales  government in their budget yesterday to increase mining royalties. This is  going to mean miners pass that cost on to you.

TREASURER:

We'll see. I mean this is a political game that is being played by Barry  O'Farrell to cover up for his embarrassment at the fact that he's got a  budget deficit he didn't tell anybody about...

SPEERS:

He's made the decision and you're going to have to fit the bill?

TREASURER:

Well, we will see because I tell you one thing, the revenue from the MRRT  is critical to deal with the pressures in the patchwork economy to give tax  cuts ...

SPEERS:

You say you won't follow the mining tax and refund the miners for ...

TREASURER:

No I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is we'll deal with Mr  O'Farrell and what he's done when it's entirely clear what he's done and  how he's going about it and we will meet our commitments in terms of  the expenditures flowing from the MRRT because it is critical for dealing  with the challenges of the patchwork economy, and we won't be derailed  in doing that by Barry O'Farrell who's playing some pretty puerile political  games.

SPEERS:

So New South Wales could lose some revenue in other areas?

TREASURER:

We'll deal with it responsibly, we'll have a look at what they're proposing  and we'll deal with it.

SPEERS:

They say they need to do this, Mike Baird, The Treasurer, because they're  being duded in the carbon tax. They're not being compensated for the  impact this is going to have on their coal generators?

TREASURER:

This is just complete rubbish and you know they'll play their games and  we'll get on with responsible economic policy. This is a very poor effort  from a first term of government - with the majority they've got - to bring  down a budget that's so confused and all over the place like this one, let  me tell you.

SPEERS:

Why should Victoria and South Australia be compensated for the impact  on their brown coal generators when New South Wales...

TREASURER:

Because we're implementing responsible policy. There's very good  reasons for the policy platform we have outlined. They understand that,  they're playing a political game and are embarrassed by their budget  bottom line...

SPEERS:

Well, just give me one reason then. Why should Victoria and South  Australia be compensated but not New South Wales?

TREASURER:

Well, I'll tell you why - because it depends on the energy intensity and  the degree to which it is an efficient or inefficient generator -

SPEERS:

And that's going to cost New South Wales?

TREASURER:

No, they say that, we don't accept their costings. It's a political game that  they're playing, they'll continue to play it. We'll get on with responsibly  managing the economy and responsibly putting a price on carbon - which  Barry O'Farrell used to believe in.

SPEERS:

Final question on the Malaysian plan which is still under consideration  from the Government in the wake of last week's High Court ruling. Is it  still your belief that this is the best way to deter asylum seekers?

TREASURER:

Well, it is the best solution and it is the best humanitarian solution as  well, and that is why the Government put it forward in the way in which  we did. Now we thought earlier in the week that Mr Abbott might have  been prepared to consider that and he made an emphatic public  statement saying that he would consider it. Now he appears to be crab  walking away from it.

SPEERS:

He said he's still prepared to work with the Government to make offshore  processing possible?

TREASURER:

Well, I'm not sure what he's saying at the moment, I think he's changed  his tune. He should come and tell us whether he's prepared to support a  solution like Malaysia.

SPEERS:

What about onshore processing, would that see more and more boats  arriving?

TREASURER:

Well, the Government is going through all of the alternatives that we've  got to responsibly consider given the High Court decision, but he made a  public statement that he's prepared to consider Malaysia. Well, where is  he? Has he crab walked away from that or not? Where does he stand?

TREASURER:

Wayne Swan thank you.
