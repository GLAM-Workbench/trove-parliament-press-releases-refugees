Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Coalition commends the efforts of Australia’s  Border Protection Command June 28, 2012

The extraordinary efforts of our Border Protection Command yesterday has ensured that 130 people were rescued from  the sinking asylum vessel yesterday, Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said.

“The swift response of Australia’s Border Protection Command to deploy HMAS Maitland and HMAS Leeuwin along with  airforce P3 Orion aircraft has arguably saved many lives.

“The hard working men and women of Border Protection Command should be praised for coordinating this rescue effort  under extreme pressure - they do an incredible job under relentless circumstances.

“Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the four asylum seekers who have tragically lost their lives during this distressing  incident,” Mr Keenan said.
