NUMAS REVIEW

"The community will be invited to help shape Australia's  future migrant selection system",  the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ian Macphee, said today.

"The review is in response to the Government's policy  statement for the elections last year and to its previous  commitment,  made at the time NUMAS was introduced,  to review the system after a reasonable period of  operation", Mr Macphee said.

Mr Macphee announced that submissions from individuals  and organisations were being sought on the operation  of NUMAS, the Numerical Migrant Assessment System.

"We will also be seeking community views through a process  of public consultations", the Minister said.

Mr Macphee said that public forums would be held in  each of the capital cities to enable various interest  and opinion groups to present their views.

The Minister also announced that an independent committee  of prominent members of the community with expertise in  immigration matters would review the submissions, the  results of the public consultations and the findings of  a number of research projects being undertaken as part  of the review. j

The committee will comprise:

Professor Charles Price of the Department of  Demography of the Australian National University  and Chairman of the Migrant Settlement Council  of the ACT. .  .

Mr James Samios, Chairman of the NSW Ethnic  Communities Council and Chairman of the NSW  Migrant Settlement Council.

Mr Justice James Gobbo of the Victorian Supreme  Court,  Chairman of the Migration Committee  of APIC and Chairman of the Australian Refugee  Advisory Council.

In addition, a senior member of the Ombudsman's office  will be present at all public consultations to act as  rapporteur.

"In addition to our seeking submissions from the public  and the holding of consultations,  a two-part analysis  of the operation of the system is now well under.way".

"The first is an analysis of the NUMAS. documents for a  sample of applicants drawn from a wide range of  overseas posts. This analysis will encompass cases  approved and cases rejected and give a systematic  understanding of the.way in which the system is being  applied".

"The second is an analysis of the post-arrival experiences  of a number of. NUMAS selected migrants. By relating  NUMAS assessment with actual settlement experiences we  will obtain some appreciation of the effectiveness of  NUMAS in predicting settlement success".

The Minister said that the review of NUMAS is aiming to  establish: .  .

.  whether the system gives rise to decisions -  both of approval and of refusal - which  accurately reflect the likely settlement prospects  of applicants, especially for those applicants who  have relatives settled in Australia.

.  whether the economic assessment in NUMAS adequately  reflects the capacity of applicants to make a  success of. their lives in Australia and contribute  economically to their new country.

.  whether NUMAS is sufficiently responsive to changing labour market conditions characterised  by growing shortages of people with various  professional, trade and other skills, together  with persistent employment problems for

certain ojther groups.

.  whether,  in the light of these findings, any  changes to NUMAS are indicated - such as the  amendments to their weightings or to pass score  requirements.

whether a new selection system and,  if so,  what system, should be introduced.
