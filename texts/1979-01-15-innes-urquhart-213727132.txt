TED INNES, M.P., SHADOW MINISTER FOR POSTS AND TELECOMMU N I C A T I O N S

Many Lebanese families had been left destitute by false promises from  .  res .  '

Australian Embassy in Nicosia and Beirut, the Federal Member for Melbourne,

Mr. Innes, claimed today. '

"It may be tens it may be hundreds - it is impossible to say. But ~

I have experienced the problem first hand in the tiiddle East, " Mr. Innes

said.

He had been making representation in a specific case brought to him by  Lebanese . the: Collingwood Municipal^Welfare Officer, Mr. Abdullah Roma, for almost

a year. .  .

"I am still awaiting an answer from the Minister to my last letter in

October, He.acknowledged and said he would give me an answer as soon

as possible. It's now January," Mr. Innes said. .  .

"This delay adds further to the misery for this family, xÂ»hich sold its

possessions in Beirut on the false promises of Australian Embassies.

"In this specific case they were told by the Beirut Embassy in June, 1977

that a visa would be ready in July,, and were then told to return in ;

September and October.". .

" Finally, in October they were told the visa was refused because of an

alleged health problem with one of their children". .

" Yet, in subsequent correspondence the Immigration Department:has

admitted that their decision to refuse was taken in March."

"This means that the family were promised a visa by Embassies in Nicosia . .

and Beirut for six months after the Department had decided to refuse it.

"That is disgraceful." The family has relatives in Australia xÂ»illing to

guarantee it, the health problem of the child is at least questionable,

and I believe the Government has a responsibility to alloxÂ» these people

"They sold their possessions on false promises, and now live in the

bombed-out shell of a home in war-torn Beirut. It has no services, .

and the eating area is in the open."

"In any normal legal situation they would certainly have a strong damages

case against the LAustralian Government".

Mr. Innes said the family, Mr. and Mrs. A. Nackashian, and their children,

had made their first approaches in early 1976 through Mrs.  Nackashian*s

sister, Mrs. Menzoghlian, of Boxhill. —

At that time family reunion;, was-an elligibility ground, and-Mrs.

Menzoghlian gained the impression from the Department that there would be

no problem. . Â·  Â·  .  .

"Because of the Lebanese Civil War at that time the family had to go to

Nicosia to obtain a visa, and so it sold its Beirut home and moved to a

Nocosia hotel."

From December, 1976 until May, 1977 the Embassy told them to come.back

each month, and after the May ceasefire they were told to return, to

Lebanon to await further information. Â·

"The hotel costs had taken all their money,, and Mrs. Menzoghlian had to

send money from Australia to support them". .

"They rented a Beirut house, and on June, 16 the Embassy told them a visa

would be ready in July". . . .

"They returned on July, 19, September, 19, and October, 23, when they were

finally told they could not receive a visa because of the health problem".

"Subsequently, a Departmental letter has said the visa had been refused in

March." .  ’  .  Â·

"This means the refusal decision had been before the family was told to

return to Lebanon from Nicosia and before the Lebanese Embassy told them

the visa would be ready in July."

"There is no doubt the Nackashians could have been spared a great amount of

expense and anxiety if they had been told the real situation much earlier".

Mr. Innes said Mr. Nackashain was a skilled tradesman who at one time had

been employed by an American building firm in Saudi Arabia.

The health problem involved a five year old boy, Haroution, whom it was .

claimed had a psychological problem he said.

"There is certainly doubt on this. The boy was four when first interviewed,

and had delayed speech development". .

"But Mrs. Menzoghlian tells me that the boy's mother was unable to speak. .

until she was five, and I have forwarded a certificate from the Forensic

Medical Officer at Mt. Lebanon, Dr. Adib Tohme, to the Department.

"Dr. Tohme says he found the boy to be ,''physically fit, very healthy

and of sound mind, but with delayed speech development'." .

"The family language is Armenian, and I believe all interviews on which

the Departmental decisions were made were in foreign languages through . .

interpreters".

"Haroution-now attend -the Armenian Evangelical Guertmenian School in .  .

Beirut, and I am informed he is not considered backward".

Mr. Innes said the family intended to flee Lebanon, because of the ÃÂ¯

continuing Civil War, and would become refugees.

"I have told the Minister that in the circumstances they warrant special

consideration," he said. .  .

"In my last letter I said to the Minister; 'even if I concede for the sake .

of argument that there is a health problem with the child, then I suggest

that problem is outweighted by the problems the family has suffered through

misleading information at two Australian Embassies^ an(f i  by the physical

factors under which I consider they could be classified as genuine

refugees."

"That argument is strengthened by the presence of a guarantor in Australia."

...Ik

'However, I also believe there are large question marks surrounding the

real state of the child's health'.  .

Mr. Innes said today.the family's plight was directly attributable .

to the Australian Government.  .

"I urge the Minister to accept that responsibility and grant the .

Nackashians a visa," he said. .

The Member said that during visits to the Middle East,.and.to Cyprus as

Australian- delegate: to- the. World Parliamentary Conference on Cyprus, :

a number of:  similar cases had been brought to his attention. .

"It is,impossible to say how many families could be in similar conditions

to the Nackashians, but it could be hundreds".

It is a sad reflection on the inhumanity and dishonesty of our Government

that.these people on the other side of the world are destitute in a Civil

War "environment through iio" fault of their own". .  "  .  Â·  Â·
