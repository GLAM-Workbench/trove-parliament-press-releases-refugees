E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

STEVE PRICE:

The Prime Minister refuses, as you know, to appear on this programme, instead she chooses her interviews  very carefully. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, though, is willing to come on and have a chat. HeÃ¢ÂÂs on the  line. Morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Steve.

STEVE PRICE:

Do you want an election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course. I think that itÃ¢ÂÂs fundamentally dishonest of the Government to say there will be no carbon tax  before an election and then a couple of months later to say there is going to be a carbon tax and this  democratic deficit just gets worse and worse, Steve. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a report in one of the papers today that the latest  version of the Garnaut report, which is coming out today, is going to recommend the establishment of an  independent body - independent of voters, independent of elected politicians - that is going to set the  emissions reduction targets and by implication the rate of any carbon tax. Now, this is just outrageous. First  of all, they donÃ¢ÂÂt tell us before the election that there is going to be a carbon tax. Then they are proposing to  sneak the legislation through the parliament and finally, they are going to set up, if GarnautÃ¢ÂÂs right, this  body, unelected, unaccountable body to tell us that the tax rate can be increased.

STEVE PRICE:

Well, that same report this morning says that Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs own climate change negotiators are working on  a similar scheme. So that would then abrogate the Government of having to take the tough decision,  wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs right. I mean, it would basically mean youÃ¢ÂÂve got an unelected body setting the tax rates of our  country. Now…

STEVE PRICE:

So, it would be like a bunch of accountants having been allowed to set the rate of the GST?

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs exactly right. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a body thatÃ¢ÂÂs not necessarily focused on the economic welfare of the Australian  people, itÃ¢ÂÂs not accountable to the Australian people, determining in effect what the tax rate would be and I  just think that the public are entitled to be appalled.

STEVE PRICE:

So we are putting the tax system in the hands of Ross Garnaut and some independent group of people?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that appears to be the logic of the report that is about to be presented and it just suggests to me, Steve,  that this is a Government which is completely out of control when it comes to climate. This is a Government  which isnÃ¢ÂÂt following the publicÃ¢ÂÂs agenda, itÃ¢ÂÂs following the GreensÃ¢ÂÂ agenda.

STEVE PRICE:

If we had to have, or if we did have an election, as I believe we do need to have now to let Australians  decide this, youÃ¢ÂÂd have to explain in detail your alternative to a staged carbon tax/emissions trading scheme.  Could you do it, simply, and argue it properly?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look I think absolutely we could, Steve, and I mean, at the risk of doing it once over lightly, we want  to see more trees, we want to see more carbon in soil and we want to see smarter technology and we will set  aside about a billion dollars a year on average from savings in the budget to go out and purchase these  outcomes - more trees, more carbon in soils and better technology. Now, we will spend the money and we  believe that if we spend that money intelligently on the best schemes that the market comes forward to us  with, we can reduce emissions by five per cent by 2020. Now…

STEVE PRICE:

But how would that control, you know, the higher polluting brown coal power plants of the La Trobe  Valley, for example?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, one option under our scheme would be to fund a transition from coal to gas but in the end, if the  objective is to get emissions down, whether you reduce the emissions of coal fired power stations or whether  you reduce emissions by getting more carbon into the soil is neither here nor there. The important thing is to  get the emissions down and I think we can do that with our direct action policy.

STEVE PRICE:

Do you believe the science? I mean, we have the UN Climate Change Panel today, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a story in the  Fairfax papers, suggesting if we warm the planet by another four degrees and they say that might happen,  that that would wipe out 40 per cent of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs species. Do you believe this stuff?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that climate change does happen and I think that humanity makes a contribution. Now, look,  IÃ¢ÂÂll leave the scientists to argue over particular scientific reports but I think that it is important to take action  against credible threats and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are proposing to spend over the forward estimates period $3.2  billion and about $11 billion over the decade.

STEVE PRICE:

But itÃ¢ÂÂs almost another argument now, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? I mean, you can be divided on the science, none of us really  understand it, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think. But that we do know is that we were promised thereÃ¢ÂÂd be no carbon tax under a  government Julia Gillard led. Wayne Swan backed up that comment days before the election. Now we are  going to get one. Surely itÃ¢ÂÂs fair for the Australian people to say, Ã¢ÂÂok, let us decideÃ¢ÂÂ and if we come down, I  mean, IÃ¢ÂÂd like your comment on this, if you were to lose an election on that basis, would you believe that it  had been a fairer argument?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, absolutely. Look, if we had an election that was effectively the Government seeking a mandate for its  carbon tax and the Government won, the Government obviously could say, Ã¢ÂÂlook, weÃ¢ÂÂve won fair and  square, let us get this carbon tax implemented.Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂd entirely accept that.

STEVE PRICE:

We are getting ad campaigns that are disingenuous. We had the Ã¢ÂÂYesÃ¢ÂÂ campaign that was run across the  weekend. I interestingly note that the former opposition leader John Hewson who couldnÃ¢ÂÂt explain the GST  on a birthday cake is now telling us that he is a supporter of a carbon tax. Does that disappoint you?

TONY ABBOTT:

And some cheeky person suggested perhaps he should explain the impact of a carbon tax on a birthday  cake…

STEVE PRICE:

You better hope no one asks you that question.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, IÃ¢ÂÂm not the one whoÃ¢ÂÂs in favour of a carbon tax, you see. So I can say, look, itÃ¢ÂÂs not my job, itÃ¢ÂÂs the  job of the Government to explain a carbon tax on a birthday cake. In fact that question was put to Bill  Shorten, the Assistant Treasurer on QandA a few weeks ago and he made a complete hash of it. He sounded  almost as inept and blustering as the Treasurer Wayne Swan does in the parliament but, look, you know  John Hewson is entitled to a view just as the various actors whoÃ¢ÂÂve been trotted out in these ads are entitled  to a view but I think we really should have the view of all the people, not just some of the people. We need  to listen to the entire Australian public, not just to those who are sufficiently famous to be asked to appear in  advertisements.

STEVE PRICE:

Tony Abbott is with us, 15 past seven. It looks like, interestingly, that the Greens and the independents are  going to fall out with the Government on a couple of other things and most importantly, probably the  Malaysian asylum seeker deal and the pokies changes that Andrew Wilkie wants. LetÃ¢ÂÂs deal with Malaysia  first. The Greens and Andrew Wilkie have backed your suggestion that this deal should not be followed  through with. I mean itÃ¢ÂÂs interesting to have the Greens on your side in regard to asylum seekers.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know that the Greens are on our side across the board but they seem to agree that this  “Malaysian deal” in inverted commas is pretty dodgy. I mean, fundamentally there is no deal…

STEVE PRICE:

Well, it will never happen, will it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, because IÃ¢ÂÂm not party to the negotiations, IÃ¢ÂÂd be reluctant to say it will never happen, but it  seems that the Prime Minister rushed out and announced a deal before anything had actually been decided  and the trouble with doing that is that you then give the other side the whip hand in the discussions. I mean,  basically the Prime Minister has given Malaysia a blank cheque, should Malaysia choose to cash it. Now, I  think thatÃ¢ÂÂs just a naive way to conducted negotiations…

STEVE PRICE:

Well, we had another boat last night 52 passengers, four crew, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the fourth one since the Malaysian deal  was announced. So we now have four boatloads of people who are in limbo land.

TONY ABBOTT:

And of course there is this problem that Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN convention. People who are  there illegally do get caned in Malaysia and the question I put to the Prime Minister in the parliament last  week, I can guarantee that no boat people sent to Nauru will be caned, can she give the same guarantee for  people sent to Malaysia and of course, she just blustered away as she does in the parliament, very un-prime  ministerial and I think this is a real problem. I mean, remember she said that she couldnÃ¢ÂÂt pick up the phone  to the President of Nauru because Nauru wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a signatory to the UN convention? We do know that Nauru  doesnÃ¢ÂÂt cane people and now she is sending people or proposing to send people to Malaysia which isnÃ¢ÂÂt a  signatory and which does cane people. So, all up, for a party and a Government which said they were going  to be compassionate, what they are proposing is vastly more cruel, if I might use that sort of language, than  anything the Howard Government ever did which caused it to be denounced up hill and down dale by the  Labor Party.

STEVE PRICE:

And now we have the Solomon Islands look like being involved as well.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the Solomon Islands of course is hardly a stable country at the moment. We had to have Australian  police and soldiers there to try to stabilise it. Look, the whole thing, Steve, is a sign of a government which  is utterly incompetent and untrustworthy and I think that in the end is what is upsetting people like Andrew  Wilkie. I mean, I think Andrew Wilkie is, by his own lights, an honourable man. I think he is a decent  human being and I think he is pretty dismayed by what this Government is not contemplating.

STEVE PRICE:

Newspoll out this morning, just finally, shows that you would win an election easily but your own side has  not made it very easy for you in the past week. Do you wish that John Howard had never talked Malcolm  Turnbull out of resigning from parliament?

TONY ABBOTT:

Steve, look…

STEVE PRICE:

Just in a quiet moment, when youÃ¢ÂÂre about to nod off?

TONY ABBOTT:

…I donÃ¢ÂÂt have any quiet moments and I hope I never nod off, Steve. But look, I think last week was a bit of  a storm in a teacup. IÃ¢ÂÂve made it my practice not to comment on polls, to look instead at the field evidence  and the field evidence is that this Government wants to hit us up with a carbon tax which will cost jobs and  hurt peoplesÃ¢ÂÂ standard of living…

STEVE PRICE:

Do you need more discipline on your side? I mean, youÃ¢ÂÂve got Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey, they are all  going at each othersÃ¢ÂÂ throat.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I just donÃ¢ÂÂt think this is true. I mean, I deal with these people on a day by day basis and I just donÃ¢ÂÂt see  any of what is alleged in these papers in the way we conduct ourselves with each other.

STEVE PRICE:

Well, Andrew Bolt and I had an interesting poll on the programme last week. We were trying to work out  whoÃ¢ÂÂs the biggest pest, Kevin Rudd or Malcolm Turnbull.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Kevin certainly, I think was a poor Prime Minister and Malcolm I think has really done a very good  job in exposing the flaws in the National Broadband Network, so I think in their current jobs, there is no  doubt that Malcolm is doing much, much better than Kevin Rudd.

STEVE PRICE:

Did you see that Four Corners report on live cattle exports last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm afraid I didnÃ¢ÂÂt, Steve, but IÃ¢ÂÂm told it was pretty horrific and pretty distressing.

STEVE PRICE:

Pleased to speak to you again. You had a ride this morning yet?

TONY ABBOTT:

A very brief one. I slept in a little, so it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt as long as usual.

STEVE PRICE:

Not good.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, you are right but not as bad as that day I missed my run in Melbourne.

STEVE PRICE:

Exactly right. Good to talk to you. Thanks a lot.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Steve.
