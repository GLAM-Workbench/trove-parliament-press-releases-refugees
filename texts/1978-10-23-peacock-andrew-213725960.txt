The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock,  today re-affirmed the Government's commitment to the United  Nations and its belief in the value of the world body,

Mr Peacock said that the past year had been remarkably "   active for the United Nations, with three Special Sessions of ' the General Assembly - on the United Nations Interim Force in  Lebanon (UNIFIL),  on Namibia and on Disarmament. In addition  there had been a full calendar of conferences and the on-going  activities of the specialised agencies.

As well as serving as a forum for multilateral '

negotiation and discussion, the activities of the United ' Nations - particularly in the humanitarian and technical fields -  had an impact on the daily lives of people throughout the world. ' It was important to strengthen the United Nations,-1  ability to  provide the framework and the procedures, so necessary in an

increasingly interdependent world to enable the nations of the  world more readily to harmonise their interests.

"At a time when the structure and substance of inters '   national relations is changing rapidly, the UN remains an  indispensable forum," Mr Peacock said. ! "  ** '

The Minister noted that the disarmament agenda of .

the united Nations this year had been a heavy one. The high Ã¢ÂÂ

point had been the Special Session of the United Nations v !

General Assembly on Disarmament, held in New York from 23 May '   to 1 July. It was the largest, most representative international  meeting on arms control and disarmament to be held and had reached  important conclusions for the future course of international

efforts in this field.

Mr Peacock said Australia had played a positive and  constructive role at the Special Session and had emphasised in  particular the need for substantial progress in the area of  nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear arms control. "  '

He would be presenting to Parliament shortly the  report of the Australian delegation to the Special. Session  on Disarmament and would make a statement at that timeÂ»

Mr Peacock said that, from 4 to 10 October,  he had ... led the Australian delegation to the current session of the ‘ UN General Assembly. He had held bilateral, talks with other  Foreign Ministers and had addressed the Assembly on 6 OctoberÃ¢ÂÂ

In his statement,  he had covered a wide range of issues which *   are currently under UN consideration,  including disarmament,  '' peacekeeping,  refugees,  southern Africa, the Middle East, Cyprus, human rights,  and the North/South dialogue. He had

also been able in his statement to welcome the admission of  the Solomons as the 150th member of the UN.

Mr Peacock said that his visit had again illustrated  to him the practical relevance of the United Nations. He  pointed out that as well as the great range of matters considered  on the formal agenda of the General Assembly, the Assembly  provided an unequalled meeting place for Foreign Ministers of  many governments. He had, for instance,  had important discussions

on a range of matters designed to further Australia's relations "  with the ASEAN countries. '

His discussions in New York had also enabled him to *  *   launch a successful initiative for important new international '   consultations on the problem of Indo-Chinese refugees. This  initiative had been endorsed by the UNHCR Executive Committee  at its meeting in Geneva,  which had recommended that the  consultations take place before the end of the year. ‘
