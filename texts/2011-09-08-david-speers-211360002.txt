TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SKY NEWS PM AGENDA WITH DAVID SPEERS

SUBJECT: LABOUR FORCE DATA; IMMIGRATION; CRAIG THOMSON.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



SPEERS: Joining me now from Adelaide, the Finance Minister Penny Wong. Senator,  thanks for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.

SPEERS: First on the unemployment figures out today, were you surprised by the jump in  the jobless rate?

WONG: I think it’s important we look at this unemployment rate to keep it in context. There  was a slight weakening but this is still a very low level of unemployment, both historically  and also by global standards. Let’s remember what the unemployment rate in the United  States is: 9.1 per cent. And we entered the GFC, the global financial crisis, with the same  unemployment rate as the United States. We’re at about 5.3 [per cent] on today’s figures,  they’re at 9.1 [per cent].

SPEERS: But here in Australia jobs have been lost and they’ve been lost in the two  apparent boom states, resources boom states, of Western Australia and Queensland  particularly. Why has that happened?

WONG: I think as Chris Evans said in his press conference and as Wayne Swan has said,  we do have a patchwork economy. There are state variations in the unemployment rate.  But I again make this point David, there are more people employed now than there were a  year ago.

So after a year of minority government, with Tony Abbott running around doing his best to  wreck everything and anything, and talking down the economy - we have an economy that  is growing, and we have more Australians in work than a year ago. And I think that’s a  pretty important fact.

SPEERS: Let’s move on to asylum seekers. The Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister,  Wayne Swan, on this program yesterday said the Government’s plan to send asylum  seekers to Malaysia was in his words still the best solution and the best humanitarian  solution as well. Do you share that view?

WONG: This is a very difficult problem and the problem is that this has been a highly  contested, highly politicised space for a long time. And what the Prime Minister has done is  say let’s really go to the heart of what causes people to get on boats. And that is why the  Government put forward the approach with Malaysia.

Because what it did was it gave people a disincentive to make what we know is a perilous  journey, which unfortunately has had tragic consequences. So absolutely I support the  approach the Government is taking. It is obviously the case that the High Court has made  its ruling. We have to deal with that and unfortunately what we see is Tony Abbott on your  program just a few moments ago walking away from the position that he held a couple of  days ago, where he appeared for a brief moment to be prepared to take a bipartisan and  sensible approach to this issue.

SPEERS: But what about, so you’ve made it clear that you still support the idea of sending  asylum seekers to Malaysia. Have the Greens and those in the Left of your own party got it  wrong when they say we should now have only onshore processing?

WONG: I think this is an issue in which people have very strong views and as I said it’s an  issue over the last ten years which has been highly politicised. I think it’s important to say  well, what are the sensible policy solutions. There aren’t any easy ones David, and if there  were easy ones, someone would’ve found them. And it’s wrong of Tony Abbott to pretend  there is an easy solution; as you know there isn’t. But we do have to take the sensible  approach to this and that’s the way the Government will approach it. I’d urge Tony Abbott  just for a change to try and do the same.

SPEERS: Is it sensible to argue that onshore processing alone will lead to the sort of social  problems and even riots that we’ve seen in London and Paris?

WONG: I don’t know the context of those comments in detail and I’ve not seen precisely  what was said.

SPEERS: Well it’s apparently what the Department’s been advising the Government, have  you heard that sort of advice?

WONG: You said apparently; I think it is the case that we know onshore processing itself  doesn’t have the sort of deterrent factor that making sure people don’t get on the boats  would have. That is the policy dilemma that faces the Government and again I’d say this - it  would be good on this policy issue Mr Abbott could take a sensible approach rather than  playing politics. I think from the excerpt of the interview you played, it appears he’s not  capable of that.

SPEERS: And on Craig Thomson, Minister - you’re a lawyer, you’re a barrister. Is Craig  Thomson now in the clear?

WONG: Can I say, I think this whole episode really underlines the approach the Opposition  are taking. I mean, what has been their priority in recent months David? Has it been jobs,  has it been the economy or has it been doing whatever they can to destroy the  Government? Their complete obsession with this matter simply shows what their priorities  are. And their priorities are political. They’re not about what’s good for the country, they’re  not about what’s good for jobs.

SPEERS: My question is I guess more legal. Is he now in the clear?

WONG: Well I think the police statement stands for itself - they didn’t believe there was  evidence that warranted a formal investigation. And unlike Senator Brandis, I believe these  matters should be dealt with by the appropriate authority. It is utterly inappropriate in my  view for Senator Brandis as the shadow attorney-general to do what he did. And I will not  join in with that. This is a matter for the appropriate authorities and the police have made it  very clear they did not believe there was evidence to warrant a formal investigation.

SPEERS: They’ve said that based on the accounting practices of the union there’s no  evidence to warrant an investigation. He may not have committed a crime, but does that  mean he’s been cleared of actually using his credit card for the sort of things he’s been  accused of?

WONG: I’m not going to comment on unsubstantiated allegations. What I have always said  is that - sorry, I’m losing my earpiece there David - what I’ve always said is that if there are  complaints to be made, they should be dealt with by the appropriate authorities. We  shouldn’t have the sort of obsessive political attack that we see from the Opposition. But  worse, we shouldn’t be having a shadow attorney-general ringing up his mate in New South  Wales, the Police Minister, on a matter that the police were considering.

SPEERS: Well Craig Thomson now says he will make in the near future a comprehensive  statement on these matters. Would you like to see him clear up, for once and all, whether  he did use his union credit card at a brothel and for the big cash advances so that this can  be put to rest?

WONG: I think Craig Thomson has got to make his judgment about the best way to deal  with the allegations that have been publicly made against him. I hear from the statement  he’s made that’s what he’s proposing to do in the near future. And that’s obviously his  decision.

SPEERS: Finance Minister Penny Wong, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
