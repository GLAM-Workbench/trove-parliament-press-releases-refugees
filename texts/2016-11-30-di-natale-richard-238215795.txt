Media statement - Senator Richard Di Natale

Leader of the Greens Dr Richard Di Natale has spoken out in support of the peaceful protesters  who demonstrated for refugee rights in Parliament House today and accused the Government  of wilfully ignoring community calls for an end to offshore detention and the cruel treatment of  people seeking our protection.

“If it takes a number of peaceful protesters to get the Government, the opposition and  members of the media to pay attention, then we’re for it.

“What other forum is there for people to express their democratic right? The House of  Representatives is meant to be the people’s house and these protesters have given those  people locked up in Australia’s detention centres a voice today.

“We are at a point in this nation’s history where we have a government, supported by the  Labor party, who have said that it’s acceptable for innocent people seeking our help and  protection to be turned away. But not only do we turn them away, we torture them. Successive  Governments have inflicted great harm on a generation of innocent children.

“Sometimes you have to shout to be heard. We can’t continue to turn a blind eye, we need to  close the camps. We need to bring them here.”
