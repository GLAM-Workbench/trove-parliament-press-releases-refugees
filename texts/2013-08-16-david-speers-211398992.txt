SPEERS:

The Shadow Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison, joins us now,  thanks for your time.  I want to go through how this would work, your  plan.

MORRISON:

Sure.

SPEERS:

An asylum seeker in the detention system now still waiting to be  processed - under your arrangements, if you win the election, what  will actually happen to them in terms of their processing?

MORRISON:

Well first of all there are 30,000 people in the situation you’re talking  about right now, David.  That’s 30,000 people that the Prime Minister  is trying to pretend just aren’t there at the moment.  Of those 30,000  the first thing that would be done is the caseload of those individuals  would be triaged and we’d look right across and do a scan across  that, a screening if you like, that would determine those cases that  are able to be decided relatively quickly and particularly those cases  that may be relatively quickly decided in the negative.

SPEERS:

So just on that, that essentially says if you are from a particular  country, Sri Lanka for example, you can deal with them faster than  others?

MORRISON:

No, it’s not necessarily where they may have come from.  It may be  the information that’s available, it may be for example we’ve made it  pretty clear that if people are reasonably believed to have thrown  their documents away then the answer’s no so that’s a fairly  straightforward decision.  So it is about and this is based on what  happens in the UK where they triage a caseload and they prioritise  cases for assessment based on where they can make more ready  decisions and particularly where you’re prioritising those that might be  on a negative pathway, that means you can move more quickly to  removal and that’s what they’ve been able to achieve in the UK.   They’re getting a much higher rate of people going back because  they are held in detention, they’re getting decisions more quickly and  then they can make the decisions about what they do with the rest of  their lives.



SPEERS:

If at that stage they are determined not to have a chance at refugee  status, then what happens?  What sort of review of that decision  would take place?

MORRISON:

Well after the initial screening there is a primary decision by a case  officer and this is what happens all around the world with the  UNHCR.  If that decision is a negative and someone wants that  reviewed, there is a review by another case officer.

SPEERS:

Well presumably everyone would want that reviewed, if they’ve come  all this way and they’re found not to, they’d all want the review.

MORRISON:

I wouldn’t make an assumption about what they may or may not want  to do.  That would be a matter for them.  But that would be the  process, it’s what is applied all around the world.  It’s a non-statutory  process, it’s an administrative process.  It’s what we used to have in  place and it’s what was abolished by this government many years  ago and then taken further by providing a rights of appeal to the  Refugee Review Tribunal which had hard-wired access then into the  Federal courts and so on.  At the end of the day, the High Court as  you would know, David, appeals can always be made to the High  Court about pretty much anything and that’s understood.

SPEERS:

And that would still be the case, there’s nothing you can do about  that?

MORRISON:

We’re not changing the constitution, David, no.

SPEERS:

So do you expect then that you would end up with a lot of these or at  least after an initial test case, many of these ending up in the courts?

MORRISON:

Well David what we want to make clear here is that we think the tick  and flick approach of the Labor party needs to end.  We’re getting 90  percent of these cases getting approved as yes’s, we’re getting 80  percent overturn rates by the Refugee Review Tribunal and its  predecessors into yes cases.  And I think this undermines the  integrity of the -

SPEERS:

But instead of tick and flick as you call it, you may end up with a  clogged court system if -

MORRISON:

Well I don’t see how that’s possible given we’re not necessarily  providing that access.  What we will be tasking the officials to do if  we’re elected is to return us to this non-statutory administrative  process so we can get decisions made more readily and then begin  the process of removals.  Because we’re going to have 30,000  people that we have to deal with here and that is the legacy of five  years of border failure.   Not there are two problems here.  We have  to deal with the boats coming and they have to be stopped and we’ve  got Operation Sovereign Borders.  We then have to deal with the  legacy caseload of 30,000.  Now those 30,000 people will get a  permanent visa under the Labor party on the other side of this  election if they’re found to be refugees.  Under the Coalition, they  won’t.

SPEERS:

Ok I want to get to the TPV side of things but just on - I think the  current approval rate is you said 90 percent for -

MORRISON:

After final reviews, it’s about nine out of ten.

SPEERS:

So can you guarantee that it would be any lower under this system?



MORRISON:

What I’d guarantee is it would be fair dinkum.  That’s what I can  guarantee.

SPEERS:

What does that mean - would it be any lower than 90 percent?

MORRISON:

Well it’d mean that I would have confidence and I could give the  Australian people confidence that the system we’re following would  not be a tick and flick, would not give the benefit of the doubt to those  who throw their documents away, which are not just giving the benefit  of the doubt to push yes’s through the system because it’s a lot  easier to say yes than it is to say no.

SPEERS:

But it would still be immigration department officials doing the work  and they would still as you acknowledge have access to the courts so  you may well end up with -

MORRISON:

Only to the High Court.  David, I’ll pull you up there, access to the  High Court.  Not the Federal Court, the High Court.  That’s where an  appeal can be made.  There was a case some years ago which I’m  very familiar with and that was the case when Senator Evans was the  Minister because I’ve been around this portfolio a while.  That was my  first Minister, I’m now onto the fourth.  Under that Minister, what they  did was; the way they ran the administrative process all those years  ago, the court found that it was effectively operating like a statutory  process and as a result, they introduced the ruling that they did.  Now  I will want my officials to go back and review all of this and find the  way through to get us back to the situation where we were under the  Howard government.  Now that’s a lot of work to do, it’s not easy -

SPEERS:

So telling those officials in the Department to take a tougher  approach to the assessments?

MORRISON:

No, what I’m saying is I want the process to go back to the way it was  when we had a first officer decision, second case officer review and  removing the appeals to the RRT and then onwards to the Federal  Court and so on.  Now I know that’s difficult and that is the task, that  is the goal, that is the direction that we will set.  Lawyers will say it  can’t be done, the government will say it can’t be done, everyone will  say it can’t be done.  We’re not going to give up on this, because we  do not think the tick and flick system which the government has been  running, giving out permanent visas on the other side of the election  is the way to go, and what the Australian people will cop.

SPEERS:

You can’t necessarily say it will be done, it will end up being tested,  won’t it, in the courts one way or another?

MORRISON:

Well these things are always tested but what I’ve found with the  government, David, is they are always shy of that.  I mean, it’s for the  Parliament, it’s for the Government to make decisions, OK?  We’re  not going to run shy of the courts every time because some lawyer  somewhere might have a different view. We’re not going to give up  on this.

SPEERS:

On the temporary protection visas, so a three year visa if after all that  they are found to be a refugee, they only get a three year visa -

MORRISON:

Up to.



SPEERS:

Up to three years.  They would not have family reunions.  What  happens at the end of that, if the assessment is things are better in  their home country, you’re saying they’d be sent back home but  presumably they’d want to stay in Australia -



MORRISON:

Well they don’t get to.

SPEERS:

So what do they -

MORRISON:

Because their refugee status would be reassessed at the conclusion  of their visa, now that visa -

SPEERS:

Are you talking about forcible returns?

MORRISON:

Well they’d be in the same situation as someone who gets a no on  their refugee status assessment now.  What would happen at the end  of that period of time -

SPEERS:

Which is what?

MORRISON:

Under our system they’d go into detention until they went home and  you would encourage them to do that voluntarily, in cases where it  can be-



SPEERS:

And in the case of Iran, Iran doesn’t take back asylum seekers who  failed to get refugee status.

MORRISON:

They don’t take back involuntary returns, but voluntarily people return  and if people want to spend an indefinite time in detention, well that  would be their choice but they will not be living in the community if  they are not found to be a refugee, because they’ve illegally arrived in  Australia and they have no right to be here.

SPEERS:

Are you able to give any guarantee that they won’t eventually be  given permanent residency here?

MORRISON:

People who are not refugees will not be given permanent residency in  Australia, of course not, and those who are found to be refugees will  have their cases reassessed at the conclusion of each of their  temporary visa terms.  This is the -



SPEERS:

And then given permanent residency or just another TPV?

MORRISON:  There’s no guarantee of that, the most likely scenario is we would roll  that over because hopefully someone’s position is not permanent.

SPEERS:

But some would get permanent residency?

MORRISON:

No there are no guarantees of that and no one should expect that.   No one should expect that.

SPEERS:

But you’re not saying that all of these 32,00 asylum seekers, none of  them will ever be given permanent residency?

MORRISON:

I’m saying no one should expect that.  Our system is to provide  temporary visas not permanent visas but I can guarantee you this.   On the other side of September 7 there are 30,000 people who will be  very happy to see the re-election of a Rudd government because that  means the vast majority of those Kevin Rudd will give permanent  visas to.  That won’t happen under Tony Abbott.



SPEERS:

The record on TPVs under the Howard government, how many  asylum seekers at the end of their three-year period were actually  sent back to their home country?

MORRISON:

Well that won’t be guiding my decisions David as Minister.  My  decisions will be guided by the policy -

SPEERS:

But were any?  Were any sent back home?

MORRISON:

Some went back home but the point I’m making is that won’t be the  guide as to how I might make decisions in the future.  I’ve outlined  this policy fairly clearly and I think whether people agree with me one  way or the other, I think they’ve learnt that I mean what I say, I say  what I mean and I’ll do what I say.

SPEERS:

OK but it seems that at the end of that three year period, if they’re not  willing to go back home voluntarily, you -

MORRISON:

If they are not a refugee, they will be in detention.

SPEERS:

So in Australia, or in Papua New Guinea or Nauru or here in  Australia?

MORRISON:

In the short and medium term, most likely in Australia but there’s  nothing necessarily to prevent people over the longer term to be in  those other places but that would subject to the agreements and  arrangements made with those countries of course.  So I certainly  don’t rule that out but I don’t see that as the prospect in the short to  medium term, those facilities will be used for other purposes.

SPEERS:

And Scott Morrison, what do you think about how the PNG  agreement and the Nauru agreement are working?  The  government’s been suggesting in the last week I suppose that there  are some early signs of success, of fewer people coming, do you  agree with that?

MORRISON:

I’m not really making any call on it one way or the other.  We won’t  know what the real effect of this is until the other side of the election  and the follow through.  We still don’t have any details David as you  know of what the resettlement arrangements are in PNG.  At the  moment it’s not clear to me they’ll be able to resettle almost anyone  because there are still statutory changes that have to be made in  Papua New Guinea.  The issues of are we paying them pensions for

five years, ten years, fifty years?  What’s the health care, where are  they going to school, on what land will they be living?  Will they be  given access to housing?  You haven’t heard any of those details  from Tony Burke and to the extent that the resettlement position in  Papua New Guinea has been put out there at the moment, it looks  very much like a big bluff.  But we’ll find out in due course and I think  that’s the real test of this arrangement.  To the extent that there’s an  announcement effect before the election is neither here nor there.   What really matters is what is the longer term effect because if you  want to stop the boats for six years as the Howard government did,  you need more than a bluff.  You need real policies and real resolve.



SPEERS:

Shadow Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison, thanks for joining us  this afternoon.

MORRISON:

Thanks a lot David, good to be with you.
