FUNDS FOR AUSTRALIAN ENGINEERS TO HELP IN INTERNATIONAL 
EMERGENCIES

Â

Australian engineers are playing a crucial role in helping  
to respond to the United Nations’ emergency refugees operations, with 
assistance from the Howard Government’s aid program.

Â

Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief Australia 
(RedR Australia) provides well trained technical personnel to the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees at short notice to assist in responding 
to emergency humanitarian situations.

Â

Through RedR, Australian engineers are involved in 
practical and important projects such as improving water supply, sanitation, 
roads, camp planning, shelter and demining.

Â

Their assistance also has a direct positive impact 
on the distribution of food aid and refugees’ access to medial assistance.

Â

As well as using their professional skills in saving 
and improving the quality of life for thousands of people, Australian 
engineers transfer their skills to the local community.

Â

To date, Australian engineers have been deployed in 
13 countries, including Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Russian Federation, Uganda, Chechnya, Tajikistan, Yemen, Liberia, Mali, 
Niger and Papua New Guinea. Nine of the 36 deployments so far have been 
women.

Â

Some 4 million people have benefited from the work 
of Australian engineers since 1995.

Â

The Australian Government this week agreed to provide 
a further $2.7 million over three years to support the work of RedR.

Â

The arrangement between UNHCR and RedR Australia is 
unique - no other organisation provides such support to UNHCR.
