UN INVESTIGATION CRUCIAL STEP TO RESOLVING MYANMAR HUMANITARIAN  CRISIS

Rohingya refugees forced to flee Myanmar must not be forced to return home until their  safety can be guaranteed.

Labor welcomes the current UN mission to Bangladesh and Myanmar as a crucial step  towards resolving the humanitarian crisis which has forced almost 700 thousand people  to flee their homes.

Labor is deeply concerned at the human rights abuses in Myanmar which the UN has  previously described as "textbook ethnic cleansing", with numerous, reputable reports of  killings, rape and arson targeting the minority Rohingya people in Myanmar.

The international community must continue to bring pressure to bear on the whole of  Myanmarâ€™s Government as well as the military. The Myanmar Government must allow  independent examination of claims of human rights abuses in Rakhine State, and hold  those responsible for abuses to account.

While it is ultimately in the best interests of Bangladesh, and for the hundreds of  thousands now living in makeshift camps to be able to return to their homes, it would be  unwise for any Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar until it is safe for them to do so.

Labor welcomes the pledge to provide an additional $15 million in the May budget for  humanitarian assistance for the Rohingya crisis and urges the Government to closely  examine the report of the UN team to determine what additional assistance Australia  can offer to assist Bangladesh to cope with the humanitarian crisis on its border.
