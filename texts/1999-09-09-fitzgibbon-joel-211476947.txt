ANOTHER BODY BLOW FOR SMALL BUSINESS

Â

Vouchers issued to Singleton-based Kosavar refugees for the purchase 
of clothing and foot wear can only be redeemed at the local Big 
W store, according to Shadow Minister for Small Business and Tourism 
and Member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon.

Â

Mr Fitzgibbon has accused the Howard Government of 
once again playing to the big end of town at the expense of the small 
business sector and wants to know whether small firms operating in the 
vicinity of other camps are being similarly denied.

Â

"Small business operators in Singleton, and I’m 
sure elsewhere, have happily made a positive contribution to the safe-haven 
process, and deserve better.

Â

“The Government’s apparent exclusive deal with 
the major chains is a slap in the face for small firms and comes soon 
after the release of the Joint Select Committee on Retail’s report 
which shows how difficult it is already for small retailers to compete 
with the major chains.

Â

“At the very least, local small business people 
deserved to be consulted and an assessment made of their ability to 
provide the clothing and footwear required. I call upon the Minister 
for Small Business to intervene to ensure small firms receive a fair 
go", Mr Fitzgibbon said.
