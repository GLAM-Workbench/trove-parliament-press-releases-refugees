E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………



SIMON BEAUMONT:

Greetings omitted.

We woke up this morning to the notion of a Citizen Assembly, investigating the price of a carbon tax, or  investigating a carbon price. What do you think of that idea?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think it’s a camouflage for Julia Gillard’s plan to bring in a carbon tax. I think that she wants a price  on carbon, Bob Brown wants a carbon tax. Thanks to the secret preference deal with the Greens there will be  a Green balance of power in the Senate, so we will get a carbon tax if this government is re-elected.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Others are saying it’s just a stalling tactic to sweeten that deal for the Greens, and it could be years before  we see a carbon price. So maybe it’s just a stalling tactic, and we’ve got nothing to worry about.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think there’s a hell of a lot to worry about, because sooner or later, even a Government as, as sort of  decision-challenged as this one, will actually get something done, and what that something will be is a  carbon tax. That’s what we are moving towards if this Government gets elected, and this 150 person  deliberative assembly, don’t know why they need that when we’ve got 150 people elected by the people in  the Parliament. I mean, this is a camouflage for the coming carbon tax.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

So during an election campaign, I guess, we focus more on these type of policies, Mr Abbott. What are your  views as we sit here today about a carbon price and a carbon tax? You’re still not in favour of it, or is that  just politics?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m against it. The leadership of my Party changed back in December over this very policy. We are against  hitting consumers with big new taxes. We’re absolutely against it, we think that you can deal with climate  change in a much better way. We’ve got a policy, we’ve had it out there since February, it basically involves  going to the market and buying better soil, more trees, more solar panels on people’s roofs, these are all  practical, achievable things that we will do if we’re elected, and it’ll give us the five per cent reduction that  we need by 2020.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

And just on, on an issue again about, an issue which is around in Perth today and we’ve been speaking to the  junior miners, the so-called mid-cap miners, this week. Are you still of the view that you would rescind any  form of mining tax or super profits tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely we would, Simon. See, we already have a profits based tax, its called company tax. We already  have a return for the non-renewable resources taken out of the ground, that’s called royalties. We have a  perfectly good system. Under the system that we’ve got the mining sector has expanded massively. Now,  this is just another one of Labor’s great big new taxes. Julia Gillard said she’d fixed it a few days after  becoming the Prime Minister. The fix turned out to be a fake. Typical of this Government it’s now falling  apart. There was a deal of sorts with the three big companies, but the small companies, the companies that  are really here in Australia because they can’t go overseas, they don’t like it one little bit. They think it’s  going to destroy investment and jobs in their sector.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Broadly speaking, the big miners, the BHP and the Rio, mine a different type of iron ore. The junior miners  are more concerned with a different type of ore that requires, that is more labour intensive, more capital  intensive, more investment intensive. Why do you think that it is that Rio, if it is just a great big tax and it’s  a fake, why is it that Rio and BHP agreed with Julia Gillard that they would pay this tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they don’t like it. I mean this idea that they’re happy with it is dead wrong. They don’t like one little  bit, even the three big boys. But they thought it was the best deal that they could get from a bad  Government. Now the thing about the three big boys is that they are international companies, they don’t  have to put their operations in Australia. So as long as their existing operations were more or less protected,  they can put all their future investment overseas. But for the smaller companies, Australia is their home. It’s  much harder for them to go overseas. That’s why they are very, very unhappy. Rightly unhappy. And the  other thing, Simon, that they’re unhappy about is the secret Green preference deal means that almost  certainly the mining tax will be increased after the election if Labor wins because of the deal with Bob  Brown.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

So while you’re here in Perth, will you meet with any of the mid-cap miners, or with FMG for example, or  any of the people that as you say are worried about this tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don’t have any meetings scheduled, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I do end up talking to some of  them in the course of the day. Certainly, I have met with them on my last visit to Perth, and have had contact

with them as you’d expect, because all that stands between Western Australia and investment destroying and  a job destroying new tax is the Coalition. We are the last line of defence against this assault on the  prosperity of Western Australia.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

As you would know, a lot of asylum seekers come to West Australian waters. They come to Christmas  Island, to the territorial waters, but they end up in our general neighbourhood. A lot of people smugglers if  they are convicted are incarcerated in West Australian jails, it’s a big issue for West Australians. Are you  going to make some sort of announcement on border protection today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I will have a little more to say on border protection today. We have a record on border protection. We  stopped the boats. Labor has a very different record on border protection, they started them up. And of  course we’ve got this fake deal with East Timor which has unravelled even more quickly than the mining tax  fix. So, look, if you want to stop the boats there’s got to be a change of government, Simon.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

With, do you support the notion of processing, if you were to win government, would you keep say, for  example, the Leonora detention centre operational, and keep processing people in Darwin?

TONY ABBOTT:

We want to stop the boats. The first thing we would do, should we win government, is pick up the phone to  Nauru, that’s the first thing we’d do. Because that would be a much greater disincentive to the people  smugglers and their customers than bringing people to towns and bases here on mainland Australia. And if  the Prime Minster was fair dinkum about wanting to do something on border protection she would pick up  the phone to the Prime Minister, to the President of Nauru, that’s what she’d be doing.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

What about this notion that, I had a chance to speak to Julia Gillard earlier this week, she says that  population levels, sustainable population levels and immigration intake aren’t linked. What’s your thoughts  on that, and what’s policy on that for you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, she’s wrong, of course, and again we’ve seen another bit of political fudging, of political faking, from  this Government since the election was called. I mean, basically, she’s been running around the country  telling people she shares their concerns, but without actually producing a policy to deal with them. This is  not a policy on population that she has, it’s a placebo, as one of the commentators said. Now, look, let’s be  clear, Simon, under the Howard Government immigration peaked at about 200,000 a year. Under this  Government it’s been 300,000 a year. 200,000 a year will give us a population of about 36 million by 2050,  300,000 a year will give us a population of 43 million by 2050.  Julia Gillard has said she’s against a big  Australia, but she hasn’t done nothing, she’s done nothing at all to stop it.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

But she has said ‘let’s take a breath on this and reconsider.’ So she has stepped back from the previous  regime’s policy, and she’s -

TONY ABBOTT:

But she hasn’t, Simon. I mean, the policy is identical under Julia Gillard as it was under Kevin Rudd. I  mean, she wants credit for being different, but she’s not different, she’s exactly the same. I mean, what has  she changed. She’s changed the rhetoric, but she hasn’t fixed the problem, and she’ll never fix the problem.  She just can’t. She’s incapable of fixing the problem.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Speaking of rhetoric, and as you know this is increasingly in Australia these days, its you versus her, we  have an almost presidential style, its based on your personalities, and people analyse what you say and how  you look, and whether you go on Hey, Hey It’s Saturday, whatever it is these days. Have you been a little  accident-prone? Have you been stuffing up at times, and mixing your messages and falling over your feet a  little bit?

TONY ABBOTT:

I hope not, Simon. But I’ll let other people make their judgements.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

On WorkChoices for example earlier this week, on the issue with talking to Neil Mitchell, and struggling to  articulate when you’re telling the truth and when you’re not?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, you know, sure, I had that notorious interview with Kerry O’Brien some months ago. But the  fact is I try to tell the truth, I tell the truth as best I can, as I see it at the time. Always have, always will.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

But people, I suppose, in the electorate would sigh when they hear that, we don’t know whether you’re  espousing a policy, or we don’t know whether you’re, whether you are telling the truth according to a  scripted moment, or an off-the-cuff moment.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Simon, look at my record. Make your judgements about me. But compare me as well with the Prime  Minister. I mean, this is a Prime Minister who engages in a whole lot of secret deals, won’t talk about them  afterwards, and then tries to run away from scrutiny. I mean, this is a Prime Minister who did a deal with  Kevin Rudd and ten minutes later broke it.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

She doesn’t want to talk about that. 92211. Could we squeeze in a couple of calls, Mr Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, sure.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Kevin’s phoned in this morning. Tony Abbott’s listening, Kevin, go ahead.

QUESTION:

5



Hi Tony. What I want to ask is with boat people and population control, for me they’re not really, really  major issues as the fact of the way to raise my family and the way that people live in this country from day  to day. So really, what I want to know is your day to day for people who live in this country, and raising a  family, and bills, and paying bills, and education, and health, and law and order. For me, they’re the three  main issues that I vote on.

TONY ABBOTT:

Okay, well, look, just a quick response, Kevin. I announced a policy earlier this week that will help families  with their educational expenses. It will give them more money and it will give them money for more things.  So that will take some pressure off the budgets of struggling families. And look, the whole point of tackling  debt and deficit, which we can do and Labor can’t because Labor are addicted to spending, is to take the  pressure off interest rates which means that your cost of living won’t increase as fast, because when the  Government is out there borrowing $100 million every single day, that puts pressure on interest rates and  that puts pressure on family budgets.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Thanks Kevin. Thanks for your call today. Mr Abbott, you’re in Western Australia, which of course as we  know at the last federal election, your Party did very well in this state. You can campaign as much as you  want here but you really have to get your message across in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.  How are you travelling over there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that where there’s a seat to contest we’ll be contesting it as hard as we can. I mean obviously,  there are some seats in the west which are going to be very fiercely fought over. I think that we’ve got a  terrific candidate in Hasluck, in Ken Wyatt, Donna Gordon in Brand is a very, very good candidate. I think  if I were Labor members I’d be feeling a bit vulnerable there. West Australians don’t like their prosperity  being threatened. It is an incompetent, amateur-hour Government that tries to clobber the one industry upon  which Australia’s, and Western Australia’s in particular, prosperity most depends. That’s what I offer  people. A grown up government. Not a government which is addicted to spin and which just reflects the first  thing that the focus group tells it in the morning.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Just finally, because I know we are out of time here, but you started off at a million miles an hour but you  were up against Mr Rudd and as we know he was falling out of favour in the electorate and in his party  room.

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ve been a very successful Opposition, Simon. I mean, at least…

SIMON BEAUMONT:

[inaudible] polls now. What do you have to do to turn the polls around?

TONY ABBOTT:

At least for the moment, I mean we have forced any number of backflips from the Government on emissions  trading, on boat people, on the mining tax. I mean, the list goes on where the Government has at least said  that  it’s changed its position. And of course, the Opposition helped to bring down a Prime Minister. This is,

in a sense, the most effective Opposition in history and what we now need to do is to crown all that with the  change of government that Australia really needs.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

I acknowledge that backflips that they’ve been forced to make and the leadership change they’ve been  forced to make. I acknowledge that. But they’ve backflipped themselves into a position of success again at  this point in the opinion polls. They’ve put themselves in front of you by backflipping.

TONY ABBOTT:

Simon, and it’s…I don’t think the public are going to be conned again. I mean, we’ve seen right around  Australia bad Labor governments change their leader and say, look, we’re all going to be different now. It’s  never different. It’s just the same. Now, the federal level of government is too important to let this con job  work and I think the public understand that.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Thanks for your time this morning. Appreciate you talking to our listeners.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Simon.

SIMON BEAUMONT:

Mr Tony Abbott, the Opposition Leader.
