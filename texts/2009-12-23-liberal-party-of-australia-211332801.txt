ABBOTT DOORSTOP - LAUNCH OF THE UPDATED EDITION OF  BATTLELINES, MALCOLM TURNBULL, HENRY TAX REVIEW, KEVIN RUDD'S  FAILED BORDER PROTECTION POLICIES

The Hon Tony Abbott MP

Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

QUESTION:

Tony, were you hoping to stuff your Christmas stockings with this book? What’s [inaudible] the timing of the

updated edition?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is a book for all seasons, not just for Christmas, but obviously I think now is as good a time as any to

be swotting up on some good ideas for the future of our country.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, [inaudible] when you became Opposition Leader that you had the last chapter ready to go?

TONY ABBOTT:

No. The last chapter was written very early one morning and very late the following night. But I guess the last

chapter is essentially an account of how the leadership change came about and I certainly think it is worth

reading if people are interested in the sorts of things which drive people in politics, the sorts of values which are

important to people in politics.

QUESTION:

Has Malcolm Turnbull given you any idea what his intentions might be for next year or after the election? Tony,

have you had any conversations with Malcolm about his future plans?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I deeply respect Malcolm. I always have. I expect I always will. We have got a long history - most good,

some a bit scratchy. But look, I am looking forward to his friendship in the future and his decisions are really for

him. But I will be happy with what he decides.

QUESTION:

Have you had much contact with him since the leadership spill?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that probably suffice to say that I have a lot of respect for Malcolm - always have, always will - and my

respect for Malcolm means not giving a running commentary on him and on his relationship with other people.

QUESTION:

Should company taxes be reduced as planned in the Henry tax review?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the last thing we will see from the Rudd Labor Government is any reduction in taxes. Labor has been on

an unconscionable spending spree for the last couple of years. Labor has destroyed in two years the fiscal

position that the Howard-Costello Government painstakingly built up over 12 years. It just goes to show how easy

it is for new and irresponsible governments to destroy the patient work of much more responsible governments,

and I think what we are going to get from this Government is more debt, more deficits and inevitably higher taxes

to pay for them.

QUESTION:

But do you agree with Mr Hockey that they should be low?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that what we are going to get from this Government is more debt, more deficits and higher taxes to pay for

them.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] should or shouldn’t be lowered?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, my position is that what we will get from this Government is more debt, more deficits and higher taxes

to pay for them.

QUESTION:

Are you looking forward to a simpler system?

TONY ABBOTT:

The last thing that we will get from Labor is a simpler system because the Prime Minister is addicted to

bureaucracy, and the Prime Minister loves regulation, he loves red tape and he loves new taxes.

QUESTION:

Are you worried Mr Hockey’s position there might sort of anger some of your business votes?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well what the whole of the Coalition team is doing is making the Government the issue. That is our

determination. This is a Government which has seriously damaged Australia’s economic position and we are

determined to make the Government the issue.

QUESTION:

What have you learnt about the job of being leader in the few weeks since you have obtained that position? What

didn’t you expect?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is an awesome responsibility. It is a heavy burden, but it is also an exhilarating challenge and I guess what I

have learnt is first of all just how hard the job is. I have developed a new respect for all of my predecessors. But

what I have also sensed right around the country over the last three weeks is a sense of excitement that there is

going to be a real contest at the next election. It is not going to be easy but it can be won. It can be won, and I

think that everyone who is unhappy with the Rudd Labor Government has new hope as a result of what has

happened over the last three weeks.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] asylum seekers are being transferred offshore to Melbourne. Do you think that that’s the right thing to

do?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is effectively the end of the policy of offshore processing. Now offshore processing was an important part of

the former government’s policy. It was very important in deterring people smugglers and I think it is typical of the

Rudd Government that it’s now broken its promise to be tough on people smuggling and it is also typical of the

Rudd Government that offshore processing has been abandoned by stealth. There’s been no announcement of

this very significant policy change. But make no mistake, this is a very significant policy change and the people

who will be most encouraged by this are the people smugglers.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] offshore processing, even for young people. Is this a return to the Pacific Solution?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, what the Rudd Government has done has completely abandoned one of the really important components

of an effective policy to stop unauthorised arrivals. What the Rudd Government has effectively done is sent a

clear signal to people smugglers and their clients: if you can get here you can stay here, and if you can get to

Christmas Island you will be brought to Australia. What Mr Rudd has done has set up a Christmas tree in

Australia for the people smugglers.
