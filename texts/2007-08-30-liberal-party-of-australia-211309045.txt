Labor to open floodgates to unskilled foreign workers

Thursday, 30 August 2007

The Labor Party has today announced that it will look at introducing a ‘guest  worker’ program to bring unskilled workers to Australia from the Pacific  Islands.

If Labor has its way, unskilled workers from the Pacific will flood into Australia,  undercutting wages and conditions and doing nothing to address the current  skills shortage.

Labor already has form on immigration issues, including their promise to close  Nauru and allow illegal arrivals who make it to Christmas Island to come to  Australia.

This irresponsible policy would inevitably result in a flood of illegal boat  arrivals heading to Australia.

Australia’s temporary migration program allows for the entry of skilled workers  only. There are currently no mechanisms that allow for the entry of non-skilled  seasonal workers into Australia and the Australian Government has no  intention of creating one.

The Australian Government will not support any scheme that would allow  unskilled workers to flood the country and threaten the wages and condition of  Australian working families.
