Axe fuel handouts to billionaire miners instead of Aussie jobs - Greens

The Australian Greens say that if the Treasurer wants sustained and fundamental structural  overhaul of expenditure he should start by axing billions in fossil fuel subsidies, not the  critical spending that is supporting Australian jobs.

“The Treasurer is softening us up for deep budget cuts that will hurt Australians but if he  wants a sustainable overhaul of expenditure he should start by axing the multibillion dollar  handouts we give in fuel subsidies to the Gina Rineharts and Clive Palmers of this world,”  Greens Leader Christine Milne said.

“Every dollar of Tony Abbott’s cruel cuts to jobs in health, education and environment will  be another dollar in the pocket of Gina Rinehart and billionaire miners.

“$12 billion will go into the pockets of big mining companies over the next four years.  Meanwhile hospitals, education and frontline community services are all going to suffer.

“Australians should be aware that every time the Abbott government axes another service  that supports jobs like legal aid, environmental defenders or regional development, it is so  that the big miners can continue to burn cheap fuel and bolster their billion dollar profits that  go offshore and do nothing for the Australian economy.”

Critical programs supporting jobs that will suffer brutal cuts instead of ending fossil fuel  handouts to billionaires include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $6.7 million from Caring for our Country program - which grants money to conservation  projects in the regions  Ã¯ÂÂ· Westmead Children's Hospital will lose $100 million in funding for the first stage of a  comprehensive redevelopment, cuts of $10 million from the Children’s Medical Research

Institute,  $12 million from the Millennium Institute, who work on cancer and leukaemia  research; and $15.1 million from the cancer care co-ordinators program  Ã¯ÂÂ· $43 million of funding for Community Legal Centres, including total elimination of federal  funding for all Environmental Defender Offices  Ã¯ÂÂ· $1.5 billion in education cuts, including ending the trades training centre program and

slashing before and after school care assistance by $450 million  Ã¯ÂÂ· $20 million cut in funding for the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program  Ã¯ÂÂ· $111.4 million will be cut from the Humanitarian Program, which provides health support to

refugees and other humanitarian entrants  Ã¯ÂÂ· National Disability Insurance Scheme set to be next on the chopping block

The Greens alternatives to cuts:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Abolishing tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry and assistance to carbon capture and  storage programs saving $12 billion over the forward estimates  Ã¯ÂÂ· Save $7.4 billion over the forward estimates by not scrapping the price on pollution  Ã¯ÂÂ· Don’t scrap the profitable Clean Energy Finance Corporation, forecast to return $439 million

over the next three years
