SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

We’re announcing today an agreement with the Electric Boat company of the United States. That company is the major US submarine manufacturer. It’s been in operation for over 100 years and therefore brings a wealth of experience to our capability. This agreement has been negotiated with the support, obviously, of the two governments - Australian and United States government, but also with a great deal of cooperation and support from the US Navy and it’ll mean that the electric boat will join with us at the Submarine Corporation and add its expertise to the ongoing future development of our submarine fleet. Our future upgrades, new capabilities and the like, and we think that bringing that wealth of knowledge and experience to bear will be a great asset for the submarine corporation and for our naval submarine capabilities. It means that staff from electric boat will be - are due in Adelaide in about a week’s time. It’s followed a study by Electric Boat in Adelaide when we and they went through what specifically what capabilities that they could add to us and to give us further strength in this area. It is very important for us because we wish our submarines to be the most capability, conventional submarines in the world and this is a further step towards achieving that objective. In addition, you might be aware that we’ve, in the last couple of weeks announced that we’re going to purchase a new combat system for each of the six submarines. That’ll be an important step in enhancing their capability and in due course we’re also expecting to enter into contract for a new torpedo which will again be an additional enhancement and I think the message is that in submarines, as in most areas of defence industry these days, you have to be constantly upgrading to remain competitive and this is the direction we’re taking. We’re having the opportunity to have a look at Rankin today which is the sixth of the submarines. The last of the six. It’s still in the hands of ASC and undergoing trials here off of Fremantle. The trials are conducted for ASC by the Navy and we’re hoping that that boat will be commissioned into the fleet in about March of next year. And the last thing I want to mention is that one of our boats, Sheean, has recently involved in exercises with the

United States off Hawaii. It performed in excellent fashion I have to say against the American ships and the American submarines which is another confidence boost for us and for the Navy and furthermore the deployments that we have submarines engaged in at the moment are also proving extremely successful and I don’t think it’s widely appreciated that this class of submarine has now been operational for us for some time and in its operational work has been not only impressing us but also impressing others who have been in the submarine business for a very long period of time. So they’re a very important asset to us and as such, we put great value in continuing to upgrade them and ensure that they remain, as we said, the most capable of the conventional submarines in the world.



JOURNALIST:

Senator what does the deal with Electric Boats mean to the workers of ASC in Adelaide?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

I think it should give them greater confidence. It’s an endorsement by the government in the important place that ASC plays in Australian defence industry and therefore in Australian defence capability. They - we manufacture them in Adelaide. We conduct the major refits in Adelaide and of course we operate out of here and Fremantle, Perth and we conduct intermediate maintenance here in Western Australia as well. So it’s a bit of a…..

JOURNALIST:

So their role will not diminish in any way?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

No. It strengthens their role. It means that whilst ASC is a very capable organisation, to get the benefit of a hundred years of experience and that’s huge American knowledge that’s built up over that period of time in relation to submarine capability, submarine usage, is a great asset for us. Of course, it wouldn’t have been achieved but for the very close relationship that we do have with our principle ally in United States and a close relationship and confidence that the two navy’s have in each other.

JOURNALIST:

And Minister what is the US company getting out of this deal?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

We make a payment to them. The contract in the first instance is for three years with four years of extensions and I think it’ll cost us about $20 million from memory. Which is actually a very good deal for us. It’s not purely a commercial arrangement. It is a contribution towards their costs of locating their staff in Adelaide to assist us but in terms of their value of their staff if they were able or wished to put them on the market they’d be much more valuable than that. Every country in the world would want that knowledge base that the US is prepared to share with us.

JOURNALIST:

Minister, what’s your reaction to allegations of torture by Australian troops of East Timor militia?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Anything else on the submarines?

JOURNALIST:

There’s been a huge cloud over the operations today in Adelaide and yet you're saying that the Electric Boat people are going to be given within a week. Obviously it's been in line for a very long time, they're landing in Australia within a week, and yet these workers have been very concerned with the uncertainty facing them over (inaudible).

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well I don’t think - I don’t understand why there would be uncertainty. The ASC is going to get the formal contract and the government has pledged to it the full cycle refits so it’s finishing off the sixth boat at the moment. It’s got two boats currently in there for major refits and that was always intended to continue. In relation to other work beyond submarines, it’s open to them to bid for that. The only….

JOURNALIST:

Inaudible.

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well they wouldn’t be bidding against Electric Boats. Electric Boats make nuclear submarines. We don’t make nuclear submarines. But with that comes a great deal of expertise that we can use for conventional submarines. The - it is still our intention to sell the company but that would only be parting with ownership. Not with the need for the resource. That’s going to be with us for a very long period of time.

JOURNALIST:

When do you make the decision about how you’re going to sell it and how the government’s going to in the long term procure equipment that ASC and others are providing unless we're talking with only the one supplier over a long period of time?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well as I said we are contracting with ASC for the major refits for the submarines during their life, so that is a long term contract. In relation to future work, as I said beyond submarines, they’d have to bid for that. In relation to the future of the ship building industry as a whole in Australia, it is true that the current plan is for -us to build less ships then have been in the last ten or fifteen years and that that will lead to some rationalisation and we’re trying to facilitate that in a sensible way. A way that we can be sure that there will be company or companies that will invest for the long term, particularly in the intellectual capital of Australia. The young naval architect systems designers, all these people that are going to be so critical to long term capability. So that part of - that’s a sensible way forward we believe in ensuring that there is a good strong industry in this area in Australia and also that we have the long term capability to properly service and maintain our fleet. The next ships that will be likely to be built will be the air warfare destroyers which will be a major challenge for Australia so when you look at sophistication the submarines are hugely sophisticated but the air warfare destroyers will also be very sophisticated. So we don’t want to lose that high level technology that we’ve built up with the submarines. And all that should give great confidence to those who have been part of ASC and part of this project to date.

JOURNALIST:

Can we have your reaction to the torture allegations?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well I know there have been investigations underway now for some time. They are comprehensive. I’ve been briefed on them from time to time. The AFP - the Federal Police have been supporting the

Defence Force in those investigations and when they are complete we would make a public statement but I believe in the presumption of innocence and that’s the way that I see it at the moment so I presume that the parties against to whom allegations are made are innocent until proven otherwise.

JOURNALIST:

Is that the same about the claim that an SAS soldier may have shot a militia at point blank range?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well as I’ve said there have been some allegations made. They go back a long way and they’re being thoroughly investigated. It’s a complex investigation but it’s important that it is done carefully and thoroughly. It is not yet complete. So well advanced, but not yet complete and when it’s complete we’ll make a public statement so that everybody knows the position and what was the outcome.

JOURNALIST:

Can you confirm that one soldier has resigned?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

No I don’t want to get into - you know if I start talking about one aspect of detail, then you’ll ask me about other aspects of detail and that may prejudice the investigation in some way. I prefer - what I need to be satisfied of is that the investigation is being properly conducted and I am satisfied of that. And I’m pleased that the Federal Police have been supporting the investigation throughout. Well you always get disappointed about allegations but from time to time there are allegations. As I said I believe in the presumption of innocence until proven……

JOURNALIST:

War crimes allegations against Australian soldiers are something we are not used to hearing in Australia.

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Fortunately we don’t hear that very often. But if allegations are made it’s important they be properly and thoroughly investigated objectively and it’s important at the end of that investigation that we make a public statement so that the public can be fully informed of what the picture has been.

JOURNALIST:

Would you say that the reputation of our most elite soldiers has been quite tarnished by this?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Oh no, no, no. If you were talking about our Special Forces they are a fantastic group of people. Look at the work that they are doing in the Afghanistan. We’re now in our third rotation there. They have excelled in their work and in their professionalism and that’s not only the view of us but it’s the view of all our coalition partners in the war against terror as well.

JOURNALIST:

Should specialised front line troops like the SAS be expected to go by the rules of war (inaudible).

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Yes. Australian’s are very - Australian Forces and the Australian government is very committed to

our Forces operating within the rules. We set rules of engagement and they strictly abide by those rules. They want those rules. Those rules are also a protection for the Force.

JOURNALIST:

What about the other side? I mean the Militia weren't observing the rules of war as such they were murdering civilians and so on?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

So what are you asking me?

JOURNALIST:

How do you deal with a situation like that when the other side's not dealing with the rules…?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

There are often very difficult circumstances. I can easily see that. But Australian Forces operate within the rules and they are proud that they do so.

JOURNALIST:

Do these people have your confidence in the interim until a final report is handed down?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

I believe in the presumption of innocence and not only do I believe in that but I have seen so many examples of the professionalism and really the high ethical behavior of Australian Forces. In particular our Special Forces.

JOURNALIST:

Are you saying there will be no public comment until the investigation is complete. The public perception into defence investigations in the wake of the fellow overboard off Christmas Island has left them perhaps thinking that the new defence inquiries will fall short and you’re saying no public comment until after the investigations are complete. Is that satisfactory?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well I’m quite happy to talk about that particular investigation. I’ve got no criticism of that. That was a thorough board of inquiry. It’s made recommendations. The recommendations including further investigations are being carried out at the moment. That’s really a very different issue to this one.

JOURNALIST:

Is it satisfactory though to say that you won’t comment on two investigations given the intensity inaudible)

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well that’s a judgement. If there are serious allegations made, I am very - I’m comfortable about sort of meddling in the investigative process. I prefer to allow it to be carried out thoroughly and properly and it is by the ADF with the support of the Australian Federal Police and that when it’s been concluded that we can announce the outcome of the investigation.

JOURNALIST:

Are you comfortable with the United Nations….

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

The Police don’t go out and brief the details of their investigations if they are doing it.

JOURNALIST:

What about the United Nations though. Are you comfortable…..

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

The United Nations has got a broader role and there has been some overlap in this instance. So they are doing their business and I’m not fully briefed on the detail of that. That’s not really my concern.

JOURNALIST:

Would it be fair to say that the Australian investigations need to be taken more seriously in terms of the results?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

The UN investigations? I don’t think so. That’s a different issue. The UN accounts to somebody else. The - we are ultimately responsible for the Australian Defence Force and so serious allegations are investigated carefully, properly, thoroughly and that’s what’s occurring in this instance.

JOURNALIST:

Why were so many Defence PR people sacked yesterday?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

No Defence PR people are being sacked.

JOURNALIST:

I’m told from our representatives in Canberra that 100 in PR.

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

You’d better go back and talk to them again.

JOURNALIST:

So that’s not true.

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

No that’s not true. But we do want to bring the PR part of the Defence Department back to what it was intended to be. The last few years it’s grown with specific one off events such as the Centenary of Federation and the like. And we are interested in it being brought back to what it was intended to be and we’re going through a process with the department of looking at how that might be achieved. They are yet to advise us on how they propose to achieve that.

JOURNALIST:

So you are winding numbers back?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well we’re not winding - well we haven’t got to it yet. What I’ve said to you is that we do desire to reduce the numbers back to what they were intended to be.

JOURNALIST:

Minister just on the UN investigation again to what extent will UN findings be considered by Australian authorities?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

They - as I said there is some overlap and they may well provide our investigators with evidence and obviously that then becomes part of our investigative process so - it’s a coincidence in some way that - they are doing a much broader task. But as I said there is some overlap and if they’ve got information that would help our investigators I think our investigators would welcome that.

JOURNALIST:

Would the Australian Army support the UN's proposal to autopsy the exhumed bodies?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

I don’t know that - whether they have specifically addressed that question. But we are happy that the UN people do their part and do it the way that they see fit. And if they are wanting to exhume bodies then we would have no objection to that. That’s their business. We want them to do their job properly as well.

JOURNALIST:

There have been some reports that the Australian Army actually asked them to exhume the bodies as part of their investigations. Do you know if that’s the truth?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

I’m told that wasn’t the case. Ok? Thanks
