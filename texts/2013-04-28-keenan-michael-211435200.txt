Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling PM Agenda Interview with David Speers April 24, 2013

Topics: Labor’s border protection failures

David Speers

We are now joined by the Opposition Shadow Minister Michael Keenan for more on this. Thanks for your time.

Michael Keenan

Good to be with you.

David Speers

What information do you have that would suggest that these people are posing any type of risk? Because the Minister  pointed out there that they are all three of these people in detention?

Michael Keenan

In the case of the Egyptian for instance, he is the subject of a red notice from Interpol, which is essentially an international  arrest warrant because he is an accused terrorist. The Minister said that these three people were in detention, it’s the  manner of which they are in detention that we are concerned about because apparently the accused terrorist was in  Inverbrackie detention facility which is a very low security environment, being protected essentially by a pool fence. That is  not an appropriate place to keep someone that is the subject of a Interpol red notice and indeed I think the Minister has  admitted that himself because apparently after that report was published he moved that particular individual into Villawood  detention centre, which is a much more secure environment.

David Speers

If that is true and that person is now within Villawood does that satisfy your concerns here? What are you saying the  Government should do about these three people?

Michael Keenan

What we are trying to understand is how it is possible that an accused terrorist could be kept in Inverbrackie, a minimum  security facility. The accused murderer from Sri Lanka, that you mentioned, was apparently in community detention. He  had just been released into the community.

David Speers

Is it you understanding that he is still in community detention?

We are seeking answers from the government about this but they none have been forthcoming. I wrote to the Minister on  Monday about the circumstances surrounding these reports and he has refused to provide any sort of response to us to  date. It is really up to the Government to explain to the Australian people what has gone on here. If we have had an  accused terrorist in low security detention, if we have had an accused murderer released into the community and if we  have had an accused drug trafficker again kept in a minimum security environment, then it must be up to the Labor  Government explain what has occurred here because I think the Australian people deserve an explanation.

David Speers

These sorts of situations do pose some difficulty for the Government. Yes there is a point here about the number of  people who are coming in and these alleged murder suspect, alleged Egyptian terrorist suspect, coming in, fair point there  but what do Government agencies then do about them? You can’t just return them home can you?

Michael Keenan

You rightly make the point about we wouldn’t be having to discuss these circumstances if we could control who is coming  here and if we could close down people smuggling. There are enormous complexities associated with these cases. The  questions I’m posing to the Government though are about the manner of detention. Why would it be appropriate to keep  somebody who is the subject of the highest level of notice from Interpol in a minimum security facility? Why would you  release an accused murderer into the community? And why would you keep an accused drug trafficker in a minimum  security environment? Yes they are complicated cases. Clearly you need to work through due process but maximum  security would be an appropriate place for all three of these individuals. It appears as I said that the Government agrees  because once this report was published they did at least move one of these individuals into a maximum security  environment. I think they need to explain why it is that they were in a minimum security environment in the first place.

David Speers

So a maximum security environment for anyone accused of a serious crime, would that necessarily be Villawood or  Christmas Island?

Michael Keenan

They are obviously two of the most hardened facilities. What is clear though is Inverbrackie is certainly not the sort of  facility where you would house somebody like this. It is a very minimum security environment. There have been plenty of  incidents of people walking out of that centre, even children just jumping the fence. It is the equivalent of a pool fence that  surrounds it and the idea that somebody who is an accused terrorist, who is the subject of an Interpol red notice, would be  housed there is just quite frankly beyond belief.

David Speers

Can I ask the Opposition’s position on another complex matter and that is what to do with those who are found to be  refugees but have an adverse ASIO security assessment? They are left in limbo essentially. What should happen to  them?

Michael Keenan

They are difficult cases but if ASIO, our domestic security agency, assesses that somebody is a security risk then clearly  there should be no circumstances in which that person would be released into the community. It is difficult because people  have been subject to very long periods of detention but of course they have arrived here courtesy of a people smuggler  and in many ways they really have nobody to blame but themselves. We cannot be expected as a community to have a  situation where people pay a people smuggle, they arrive in Australia, our domestic agency thinks they pose a risk to the  community and we would do anything other than keep them within a secure environment.

David Speers

But if they are found to be a genuine refugee by our immigration officials here in Australia, they can’t really be sent back  home. What practically happens to them? There is no third country willing to put up their hand for these people.

Michael Keenan

Your options are going to be limited. This is one of the dilemmas that you get when you are not in control over who comes  to Australia. They are very difficult circumstances to work through. There will be no circumstances in which we would  release somebody who is a security risk into the Australian community. We really shouldn’t be having to deal with these  situations if people smuggling wasn’t reinvigorated by the Labor Party when they came to office. The Howard Government  in 2007 did not need to deal with these questions. The only reason we are dealing with them now is because the Labor  Party has pursued policies that are essentially acting as a huge magnate, pulling people in from all over the world, and  creating all these difficult dilemmas for Australian policy makers to deal within the future.

David Speers

Michael Keenan, can I ask your reaction to more concerns that have been raised from Indonesia about the Coalition’s  plan to turn back boats if you form government?

Michael Keenan

We will work constructively with the Indonesians but we will always pursue Australia’s interests as well. We did work  constructively with the Indonesians in implementing exactly the same policy when we were in Government previously.  They acquiesced to that policy then. I am sure that we will have a constructive relationship with the Indonesian  Government. We will fix the problems in Australia first, then we will go talk to the Indonesians about implementing this  policy and I don’t doubt that we will be able to come to a very strong arrangement that benefits both countries.

David Speers

Michael Keenan, the Shadow Minister for Justice and customs, I appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us this  afternoon.

Michael Keenan

Nice to talk to you David.
