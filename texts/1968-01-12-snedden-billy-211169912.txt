FROM THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION

PRESS STATEMENT BY TUE Ir INISTER FOR I MMIGRATION

THE HON. B.M. SNEDDEN Q.C. M.P.

The Minister for Immigration, Mr. Snedden, referring to

Press reports of suggestions that non--European nurses should be

admitted to Australia, today issued the following statement.--"The Government decided in 1 ebruary 1966 that well--

qualified non-European Deoplc could be admitted to

L usbralia for settlement subject to their suitability

as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and

their possession of qualifications which are in fact

positively useful to Australia.

"Since then the entry has been authorised of

significant numbers of doctors, scientists, engineers,

University lecturers and other professionally-qualified

a^)-olicznts.

"Following a further review late last year the

Government decided that qualified nurses could be

admitted on a similar basis.

"At the same time it was decided that well-qualified

school-teachers could also be admitted for settlement.

"Each application must be considered individually.

"^''Ã¢ÂÂ¢  person admitted to Australia for settlement in this way is free to follow any occupation in the

sale v-,ay as other residents of Australia.

"The entry of qualified nurses as settlers is of

course quite distinct from the temporary admission of

girls from Asian and Pacific countries for training

as nurses. The latter are admitted as part of

Australia's efforts to assist the developing countries

by increasing their numbers of qualified people; and

these girls are expected -therefore to return to their

own countries when they have finished their training."
