MINISTER FAREWELLS KOSOVARS RETURNING HOME

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
this mornin g farewelled the first charter flight of Kosovars 
to leave Australia since the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) announced that it was safe for Kosovars to return home on a 
voluntary basis.

Â

Mr Ruddook said 294 Kosovars were due to depart Sydney 
Kingsford Smith Airport at 10.30am, including 115 from Puckapunyal (Vic), 
75 from Portsea (Vic), 55 from Singleton (NSW), 40 from Bandiana (Vic) 
and 9 from East Hills (NSW).

Â

“The UNHCR has indicated that conditions in Kosovo 
are sufficiently secure for it to coordinate the voluntary return of 
evacuees,’ Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“The Kosovars are eager to be reunited with their 
family and friends and to begin re-building their lives.”

Â

Some 111 Kosovars have already returned home in small 
groups on Qantas commercial flights, with more to follow, the Minister 
said.

Â

“Arrangements are being made, in consultation with 
the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), for 
the large-scale return of Kosovars home, mainly using special charter 
flights.”

Â

The Minister said that IOM has the responsibility 
for organising return flights, and in this case, Air Kampuchea would 
be flying directly into Skopje.

Â

“The second charter flight is due to leave next 
week with others following over the coming weeks.”

Â

The first charter flight will travel from Sydney to 
Skopje in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where buses will 
be waiting to take passengers to cities and regional centres.
