SUMMARY

Context of Australia 's foreign policy now much more challenging than  five years ago - major implications for Australia deriving from:

.  US economic/strategic factors; .

. Soviet political and strategic challenge under Gorbachev;

.  problems of Japan/US relations and of Japan 's moves to a new international role; and .

. continuing instability in Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific.

Challenges necessitate a sharper focus for Australia in foreign  policy - to define more carefully priorities as a middle power. Need  for our policies to focus particularly on the North Pacific. Southeast  Asia and South Pacific.

* Reference to South Africa - strongest condemnation of the latest  restrictions on political expression which have moved it ever Ã¢ÂÂ   closer to an eastern European model, (page 3)

* US budgetary problems could mean that the next US Administration  - will reduce defence spending, resulting in rising pressures for

major contractions in US defence presence in. Asia/Pacific  (page 3).

* North Pacific an area of strategic uncertainty and centre o f .   significant military tension. Australia's interests intimately  involved through alliance relationship with the US and economic  relationship with Japan and China (page 4-5).

* Balance of forces in A us. tra 1 i a/Japa n relationship changing.  Australia's share of Japanese market declines from 8% in 1970 to  5.5% in 1986 (page 6).

* Need to increase diversification into such areas as service  industries, tourism and manufacturing (page 6).

* Need for Australia to restructure our own economy and improve  flexibility. Need to remove some foreign investment controls  (page 7).

* Need to encourage Japan to take a posi ti ve approach to i ts new .   role as an important regional locus of power within the Western  Alliance (page 7).

* Consequences of China 's pursuit of economic modernisation (page 7). .  .

* Problems confronting Aquino Government and vital importance of US  bases at Subic and Clark (page 8).

No grounds for complacency about stability in Southeast Asia yet  Labor's policies marked by such complacency (page 9).

Far more emphasis on increasing coordination in policies towards  Indonesia, issue of Timor Sea boundary (page 9).

Need to take advantage of opportunities for .  extending economic  links with the ASEAN region, eg selling of education (page 10).

South Pacific taken for granted by Labor - a region that faces  series of internal and regional problems that demand sympathetic  and careful attention (page lO).

Example of Indian Ocean should serve as warning on long term  Soviet intentions (page 11).

Strong opposition to Hawke's statement encouraging constructive  Soviet political involvement in Asia/Pacific region (page 11-12).

Island-states' sense of regional community under strain. Possible  emergence of separate Melanesian and Polynesian groupings  (page 12).

Urgent need for Australia to display a consistent emphasis on  constructive, non paternalistic partnership (page 12).

New generation of post independence leaders emerging in South  Pacific. Development of good communication with new leaders to be  a major aim of Australian policy (page 12).

Mr Hayden's foreign aid priorities grievously fail our national  interest (page ). Need for far better planning in Australia's  aid to South Pacific. Example of Pacific Patrol Boat Programme  (page 13) . Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ

Papua New Guinea (page 13).

Australian Government should let Fiji Administration know that  Australia would be prepared to renominate it for Commonwealth  membership when satisfactory Constitutional arrangements are in  place (page 13).

Four specific means of increasing Australia's image in Fiji and  deepening our own understanding (page 13-14).

oooOOooo

1

It is a great pleasure to be with you and to address the  Australian Institute of international Affairs' Tasmanian  branch.  .

Since its establishment in 1933, the Institute has been an  invaluable means of promoting an interest in, and an  understanding of, international affairs and specifically of  Australia's role in the world.

Tonight I will address myself to:

.  how I see that role; and

.  how best Australia might pursue relations with those  regions with which we are intimately bound.

In dealing with the world, Australia must consistently  address two simultaneous but inter-related challenges.

Firstly, as a concerned and committed member of the Western  Alliance, we have an abiding interest in the survival of  Liberal democracy.

We are part of that Alliance as a matter of choice. We  share common interests, common goals and common values withÂ·  the other members of that Alliance, as well as  considerations of our national interests.

This rather fundamental point is, for example, often  overlooked in the never ending debate about the Joint  Defence Facilities here in Australia.

Given their integral place in the worldwide Western defence  network, Australia clearly derives as much, if not more,  from their presence than any other country.

As a Western nation we have a wide range of national  interests that must be pursued at the global level:

.  the maintenance of international order;

.  the promotion of arms control;

.  combatting the pressures for trade distortions and  protectionism; and

.  support for action of international problems such as  human rights, aid and development assistance, refugees  and public health.

Secondly, Australia has a central concern in the promotion  of the interconnected issues of security and economic  development in the Asia/Pacific region.

The challenges posed by our own Asia/Pacific region demand a  sharper focus for Australia on foreign policy and the need  to more carefully define our priorities as a middle power.

2

This is all the more so as at present we survey a scene  involving an increasingly volatile US/Japan relationship, a  more assertive attitude in the region by the Soviet Union  and growing turbulence in the Southwest Pacific.

Australia's foreign policy response to this dramatically  changed regional environment has lacked any clear sense of  direction.

To vary a Menzies comment, the Government has spread the  butter of Australian influence so thinly that it is in  danger of disappearing altogether.

In many respects, the Hawke Government has embraced a  blatant hobbyist approach to its handling of foreign policy.

Instead of heavily concentrating on a vastly changed  regional environment, Labor has dissipated its energies,   resources and Australia's credibility in areas of the world  of peripheral concern to us, and where we have no effective  power.

It has moralised and lectured about, and committed resources  to, areas remote from Australia and of little direct  consequence to our immediate regional interest.

A prime example of this was that while Australian aid to  Papua New Guinea has been substantially cut back by the  Hawke Government, Mr Hayden had no difficulty rustling up  $100 million of taxpayers' largess as a gift to the African  Front Line states last month.

Mr Hayden's foreign aid priorities have grievously failed  our national interest.

Moreover there should have been no question of any aid being  given to the Marxist regime of Mozambique so long as an  Australian citizen is held under inhumane conditions and  without trial.

The fact is that the money given to Mozambique was little  more than a cynical exercise designed to coincide with  Mr Hayden's visit to that country. Sensible diplomatic  practice should surely have enabled us to see that Mr Grey  was guaranteed a trial before any aid agreement was signed.

Whatever views may be held and however strongly about South  Africa, it is a strange commentary on this Government's  foreign policy priorities of recent years that the Prime  Ministerial and Foreign Minister's statements on South  Africa have been more memorable than those, for example, on

Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Fiji, the Philippines and  Japan.

This is not to deny that the situation in South Africa and  any solution to its problems is of immense complexity.

3

Nor should it prevent the strongest possible condemnation of  the latest restrictions on political expression in South  Africa which have moved that country ever closer to the  Eastern Bloc model.

The Coalition's foreign policy sets priorities and  concentrates resources in areas where we have genuine  security and economic interests.

I have already noted some of the developments producing a  substantially changed regional environment.

Not the least of these could be the potential impact of  reduced US defence spending in our region.

In many ways this is one of the major consequences for  Australia flowing from current economic difficulties in the  United States.

The next US administration - now less than 12 months away -  could face the need to further reduce defence spending with  the consequence that that entails for the US defence  presence in the Asia/Pacific region. .

Only a fortnight ago, President Reagan presented his last  Budget to Congress, making massive cuts in defence spending.  In the fiscal year 1989 the US defence budget has been  slashed by US$33 billion. This comes on top of a

US$20 billion cut this year. Defence Secretary Frank  Carlucci recently reported the Pentagon was facing cuts of  around US$280 billion over the next five years.

I believe this development has neither been fully analysed  or appreciated by either the Labor Government or strategic  analysts in Australia.

However, there must be a proper perspective about the United  States' economic position.

It is true that the huge US trade imbalance has created  economic problems for the Western world.

But a lot of the gratuitous criticism, in particular from  the Hawke Government, directed at the US Administration is  ill informed, factually flawed and unjustified.

It also totally misses the point of the astonishing  flexibility of the US economy and the absence of  institutional rigidities which riddle and hobble other  Western economies, including our own, which enable the US to

adjust to economic change far more rapidly.

Concurrent with the United States' economic difficulties, of  course, has been Japan's dynamic economic performance  propelling it to a position where it enjoys the world's  largest trade surplus.  This success carries with it  dilemmas. Japan's export success to the United States has  produced severe tensions in its relationship with the United

States.  .

4

These tensions are an unsettling development in a  relationship which, after all, is the key element in the  Western Alliance system in the Asia/Pacific region.

All these developments have emerged at a time when the  Soviet Union has, with the Hawke Government's endorsement,   launched political and diplomatic initiatives asserting its  right to be considered as an Asia/Pacific power.

Since Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech of July 1986 we have  seen the Soviet Union express a greater interest in the  South Pacific. .

This Soviet push for influence is all the more significant  because for the first time it is being pursued with more  confidence, subtlety and panache than ever before.

The reality is that in the regions in which Australia must  live, the potential for instability, and the dangers of  external involvement, are all too real.

To minimise or ignore these danger signals is foolish and  self-deluding.

In Southeast Asia, the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia -  with Soviet assistance - is now entering its tenth year.

The Philippines faces intensely difficult challenges in the  years ahead.

In the South Pacific the coups in Fiji last year strikingly  illustrated that this region is not immune from the  pressures of internal conflict and political change.

In addition, we have to conduct our foreign policy in the  context of substantial problems in our international  economic relationships.

As we are all aware, Australia has recently faced major  adverse effects of declining prices for our commodity  exports and our markets threatened by the protectionist  subsidised trading policies of our major trading partners -  most notably the European community. .

Taken together, these factors have produced a considerably  more difficult context for our foreign policy.

The significance and complexity of these developments .   necessitates a more regionally focussed Australian approach.  We need to make the very best use of our limited political  and diplomatic resources and ensure that intense efforts are  made to facilitate our economic adjustment to the

competitive pressures and dynamic opportunities of the  Asia/Pacific region.

I must express my own considerable concern that the Labor  Government has neither set its foreign policy priorities in  the most appropriate or effective way.

5

Alongside our global responsibilities, it is particularly  important that we now reassess our priorities in policy  towards the regions in which we live and operate.

In particular, it is time we paid more attention to three  regions, namely:

.  the North Pacific; .  Southeast Asia; and .  the South Pacific.

North Pacific

In both economic and strategic terms a stable and prosperous  North Pacific is of vital consequence to our interests.

It is the economic powerhouse of the region.

The economies of Japan and the newly industrialising  countries such as Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong have  consistently had some of the highest growth rates in the  international community over the past decade. .

It is these economies that have transformed the Asia/Pacific  region into one of the major growth centres of the  international economy.

At the same time, the North Pacific is an area of prime  strategic concern to the two superpowers - perhaps the major  one after Western Europe.

It is an area that contains major elements of  politico-strategic uncertainty including the Korean  Peninsula.

Indeed, the number of conventional armed forces in the North  Pacific is a staggering 8 million.  The total defence  spending by all countries in the area is estimated at about  US$120 billion a year.

Our own interests are intimately involved with this area -  through our alliance relationship with the United States and  through our economic relationship with Japan and, to a  lesser extent, with China.

We have an interest in the continued political stability of  the area and in the prevention of any outbreak of conflict  in.such flashpoints as the Korean Peninsula.

Moreover, any major changes in the balance of forces in the  region which undermines Western security interests, such as  the emergence of the Soviet Union to a position of r   preponderant influence in the area, can only be viewed as a  matter of very great concern to Australia.

Alongside these general security interests, our major  concerns in the region focus on our trade relationships with  Japan and China.

6

The key relationship between Japan and Australia is, of  course, the economic one.

The economic relationship is extremely important and current  developments indicate this importance will increase in the  future. However, the balance of forces in the relationship  are changing and will continue to do so in the foreseeable

future.

We have to confront that reality.

We face certain problems in our trading relations with  Japan, reflecting the serious deterioration in our terms of  trade as a result of the plunge in commodity prices in  recent years.

It is a situation compounded for us by Japan's attempts at  diversifying the sources of supply for its raw materials in  accordance with its policy of comprehensive security.

As a result, our share of the Japanese market has declined  from 8% in 1970 to 5.5% in 1986.

We must be concerned that Japan, because of the importance  it attaches to its own relationship with the United States,  is prepared to reach bilateral trade arrangements with it in  commodities such as beef and coal, to the grave detriment of  Australian suppliers.

Such pressures are inducing major long term shifts in the  nature and composition of the economic relationship between  Japan and ourselves. Although raw materials will continue  to be important in that trade, there must be an impetus on-  our part to increase our diversification into such areas as

the service industries, tourism and manufacturing.

That is why domestic efforts to restructure our own economy  and improve flexibility must be pursued with vigour.

In particular, this means more deregulation and competition  in the public sector, in which many emerging service  industries are located, and the labour market in order to

focus management and employees on product quality and cost  competitiveness.

We must also remove remaining foreign investment controls,  except for certain strategic areas such as media.

These developments would lend greater credibility to our  efforts to dismantle Japan's extensive import barriers.

At the same time, we should acknowledge and adjust to the  regional implications of the likelihood of Japan's global  economic power being reflected as an increase in its global  political influence.

7

In accommodating this development we have to come to terms  with the disparity in power between ourselves and Japan:  Japan is a world economic power while Australia is a middle  ranking power.

It is in Australia's interests to encourage Japan to take a  positive approach to its new role as an important regional  locus of power within the Western alliance system.

It is important to ensure that such a role is defined by the  Japanese political establishment in broad terms and which  take account of the political sensitivities and differences  in outlook of other members of the alliance and those states  in the region which are sympathetic to it.

But, for Australia to do this successfully, there is a need  for the Government to give more attention to this vital  relationship.

We must define in a rigorous and systematic way the  essential national interests involved in our bilateral  relationship with Japan.

A similar approach is necessary to further consolidate the  Australia/China relationship. One of the most important  developments in the North Pacific area over the last decade  has been China's pursuit of economic modernisation.

The implications of the fact that by the early 21st century,  as its industrial potential develops, China will become a  trade competitor with Australia in such North Pacific  markets as Japan and South Korea need to be carefully  addressed.

Southeast Asia

The members of ASEAN have over the past decade maintained an  impressive degree of internal stability, economic  development and effective regional cooperation.

The progress of the ASEAN region stands in stark contrast to  the continuing debilitation of the three communist  Indo-China states.

This progress, however, does not justify complacency about  the future of the ASEAN region or of Southeast Asia more  generally.

Vietnam's presence in Cambodia, now in its tenth year,  continues to pose serious problems to Thailand and for ASEAN  generally.

While the recent discussions on the issue by ASEAN and the  talks held between Prince Sihanouk and Premier Hun Sen gave  some grounds for optimism, an acceptable solution to the

problem is not yet near. .

8

The members of ASEAN themselves face substantial political  development issues.

In the Philippines, the Aquino Government is confronting the  problems of trying to reconstruct a viable structure of  political authority and revitalising the country's battered  economy.

Whilst I acknowledge the substantial progress that has been  made in instituting new constitutional and elected political  institutions, the capacity of the Aquino Government to  implement vitally needed reforms (as in land tenure) still

remains uncertain.

I do not think that we can minimise the problems the Aquino  Administration faces at all levels - economic, social,  political and military. It faces a very large communist  insurgency and has experienced severe problems of unity  within the military, which I hope in the interests of all

are being overcome. '

Only recently, a leading Philippine communist stated that  Soviet aid may already be secretly forthcoming to the  communist insurgency movement.

We already know that the Communist Party of the Philippines  (CPP) has close relations with the Vietnamese Communist  Party - a party heavily, almost exclusively, dependent on  Moscow.

The Aquino Government is now entering the process of  preparing to renegotiate the status of the US bases at Subic  and Clark. .

The outcome of this process is of vital importance to both  the security of the ASEAN region and of Australia. I will  be in Manila next month and will stress to the Philippine  government the crucial importance a Coalition government  would place on a viable American presence in the region.

This is all the more so in view of the huge Soviet presence  at Cam Ranh Bay. .

That base in Vietnam is now the largest Soviet naval base  outside of the Warsaw Pact countries. It has been  transformed by the Soviets into the largest  forward-deployment naval base in the world.

The massive buildup of Cam Ranh Bay - which I should stress  is closer to Darwin than our northern capital is to  Melbourne - underlines the crpcial necessity of the United  States deterrent in our region.

Less dramatic but nonetheless important challenges are faced  by other ASEAN countries.  .

9

For example, both Singapore and Indonesia will soon face the  challenge of how to arrange for the transition of their  highly experienced and capable leaders when Prime Minister  Lee Kuan Yew and President Soeharto retire from office.

Overall then, there are no grounds for complacency about  stability in the region. Yet, the present Government's  policies towards Southeast Asia have been marked by  precisely such complacency.

We need only remember that in 1983 the Hawke Government  embarked on its famous and failed effort to facilitate  settlement of the Cambodia conflict.

Indeed, the Government's moves only brought disquiet in the  region about the depth of the Government's longterm  commitment to security in the ASEAN region.

While the Government has trumpetted its role in Cambodia, it  seems not to care about the considerable tension that has  arisen in our relations with our closest ASEAN nation,  Indonesia. .

This week's visit by Mr Hayden to Jakarta and the problems  encountered with media entry to cover his visit have only  served to underline how poor that relationship remains.

There is a clear requirement for a reconsideration of .   Australia's policy priorities.

We need to urgently renew our emphasis on deepening our  relations with our closest neighbours in the region.

A major part of this process should be a heightened emphasis  on increasing coordination in policies towards Indonesia, to  quietly work towards expanding communication. -Dealings between two countries of such different cultures  and traditions require careful and sustained diplomacy and  goodwill from both sides.

One specific area of Australia/Indonesia relations which  needs close, attention is the issue of delimitation of the  boundary between the two countries in the Timor Sea.

At a time when both Indonesia and ourselves need to maximise  oil exploration and production capacities, it is important  that resource exploration in this important area can be  pursued with confidence. The need for progress.on this

issue is a prime illustration of the importance of a healthy  Australia/Indonesia relationship.

We need a clear Australian commitment to. the security of the  ASEAN region. This is particularly important in the period  in which the crucial renegotiation of the US bases agreement  is pursued in the Philippines.

10

We need to identify and take advantage of the substantial  opportunities for deepening our valuable economic links with  the ASEAN region.

This will reguire a radical change in the attitudes of some  within Australia. Let me illustrate:

Earlier this year a Sydney businessman said he would invest  millions of dollars to build a private university to cater  for students from Southeast Asia. The idea had much to  commend it, with overseas students returning to their home

countries after completing their courses.

Such a university would further deepen our links with  Southeast Asia in a practical fashion, beneficial to both  Australia and Southeast Asia source countries.

Yet, incredibly, the idea got a giant thumbs down by the  Teachers' Union when first proposed.

It is a sad reflection on how an idea that might generate  income and which is critical to our economic future can be  so quickly panned.  However, if we are serious about  securing our economic and political future, it is precisely  ideas such as these that have to be pursued.

We need to exploit the substantial scope that exists for  expanding trade in sectors such as agriculture and services  such as tourism, banking, finance, telecommunications,  education and health.

South Pacific

The South Pacific has been taken for granted by the Hawke  Labor Government.  .

As events of last year showed, it is a region that faces a  series of internal and regional problems that demand  sympathetic and careful attention.

Almost all the island-States of the region face a series of  pressing problems at the domestic level. Their economies  generally are under-developed and externally-dependent.

They share a series of difficult development problems -  geographic isolation, transport problems, small natural  resource bases, inadequate access to modern education, a  high rate of population movement from rural to urban areas  where hoped-for employment is often not available, and

seriously inadequate basic public services such as health  facilities.

These problems in themselves have the potential to foster  future dissatisfaction and unrest.

The island-States have, as you know, also recently  experienced increasing problems from the activities of  external powers.

11

I refer specifically to the overtures by the Soviet Union  and Libya, the latter which involved the Hawke Government in  an about-face on Libyan diplomatic presence in Australia and  a hasty 3 am flight by Bill Hayden to New Zealand.

Whilst Soviet fishing agreements in the region have so far  been relatively modest in scope, it is vital that the USSR  not be allowed to develop these agreements into a major  foothold in the region.

The example of the Indian Ocean should serve as a warning.  There, Soviet offers of aid to the fishing industry and  visits by hydrographic vessels quickly.led to port calls by  Soviet warships.

I entirely reject the argument advanced by Mr Hawke last  year that there is some benefit to be accrued to Australia  by encouraging Soviet political involvement in the  Asia/Pacific region.

History shows this to be a naive and dangerous proposition.

You will remember that on his way to Moscow last year, Mr Hawke announced in Singapore that he would welcome  "constructive" Soviet political involvement in the  Asia/Pacific region. . Â·

That statement marked a major divergence between the  Coalition and the Labor Party over Australia's regional and  alliance responsibilities.

Mr Hawke has failed to take up my challenge to nominate one  region in the world where Soviet involvement has been -  objectively judged to be constructive.

How can one overlook Afghanistan, Vietnam, Poland, the  Baltic States, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Cuba,  Cambodia, North Korea, Angola, Ethiopia or Mozambique?

Mr Hawke's invitation for "constructive" Soviet political  involvement in our region has also significantly weakened  his Government's ability to warn the island-states of  dealings with the Soviet Union.

It contradicts his own warnings that economic involvement is  often but a cloak for intelligence gathering.

It erodes the accepted Western security policy of strategic  denial and abrogates our responsibility in the region by not  only failing to curtail Soviet inroads but by actually  encouraging them. -

Bluntly speaking, the Government has been incapable of  coming to terms or wanting to see the strategic implications  of the new, more sophisticated Soviet diplomacy in the  region.

12

These strategic implications are in no way changed through  Gorbachev's glasnost policy or his cynical use of token  jewish emigration to influence Western public opinion.

The increased levels of interest displayed in the South  Pacific by outside powers has clearly strained the  island-states' sense of regional community.

I would not be surprised to see the formal emergence of a  Melanesian grouping (eg Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands  and Vanuatu) and a separate Polynesian community, which  might well include French involvement.

Such a development would place great strains on existing  regional bodies - the South Pacific Forum and SPEC - and  might reduce the capacity of the island-States to develop an  effective consensus on external contacts and involvement in

the region. .

The failure of the Hawke Government to understand and  promote regional consensus or to project such future  developments and their consequences is lamentable.

The confused reaction by the Government to the coups in Fiji  were a sad indictment on the Government's failure to devote  appropriate levels of attention to monitoring these internal  developments.  .

Confusion and inconsistency in policy abounds.

Parenthetically I might add, we have a Foreign Minister who  took four years before he even visited the South Pacific,  finding time to travel to places such as Nicaragua and  Vietnam before Vanuatu and Fiji.

Where to next - Tibet? '

It is time the Government effectively set priorities in  relation to the South Pacific and displayed a consistent  emphasis on constructive, non-paternalistic partnership.

A new generation of post-independence leaders is emerging in  the island-States.  The development of good communication  with these new leaders must be a major aim of Australian  policy.

There are also a number of issues which need to be  considered in moving to redevelop and consolidate our  relations with the region.

On a regional basis we must maintain the closest possible  degree of personal contacts and institutional associations.  Labor's failure to do so only reduces Australia's

credibility in seeking to contribute to the subtle process  of encouraging the reaffirmation of Western association and  the discouragement of Soviet involvement.

13

In this regard, there needs to be far better planning in  Australia's aid to the South Pacific. This was particularly  well illustrated by Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat  Programme described in the Parliament on 23 February this

year by Defence Minister Beazley as the "central pillar" of  our regional defence cooperation efforts.

Extraordinarily, the issue of running costs for these patrol  boats was not fully considered when the programme was  instituted. Only belatedly has the Government become aware,

for example, that for Tuvalu one boat's annual fuel  consumption exceeds the country's entire petrol consumption!

The running cost issue, while recognised by Mr Beazley in  his Parliamentary statement of 23 February, was negligently  overlooked when the programme was begun.  It is a clear  indication that a reassessment of aid needs to be  undertaken.

It is vitally important that a consensus on minimising the  Soviet presence and involvement be developed.

We must also give special emphasis to our bilateral  relationships in the region.

Nowhere is this more important than with Papua New Guinea  which is experiencing significant changes in generations of  leadership and which has shown an interest in playing a  wider regional role.

Fiji too, more than ever, needs Australia's careful policy  attention. Our best course now is to encourage, in a quiet  manner, the decisive return to Constitutional government,   with a strong commitment to effective representation of all  major communities.

We should let the Fiji Administration know that when such  arrangements are completed Australia would be willing to  renominate Fiji for membership in the Commonwealth.

While that process of political reconstruction is underway  in Fiji we must also consider measures that will help to  preserve standards of living and services.

There needs to be greater emphasis from our existing foreign  aid program to the South Pacific region to allow practical  means of more favourably increasing Australia's image in  Fiji and deepening our own understanding. Some measures  might, for example, include: .

.  establishing an Australian Studies Centre at the  University of the South Pacific;

.  increasing frequency and programmes in local dialects  beamed on Radio Australia;

.  the funding of specific medical training; and

14

.  encouraging visits to Australia by the widest cross-section of all Fiji citizens from professional,  youth, union and political groups.

Initiatives to the South Pacific region could also be  examined in the areas of trade and economic assistance.

In addition, good and accessible tertiary education for the  region's youth is needed and could be given added emphasis  in Australian priorities.

Conclusion Â·

The Hawke Government has failed to focus its policies on the  regions I have tonight identified as of prime importance to  Australia.

It has refused to involve itself in areas of crucial  importance where we might have a capacity to influence.

Labor's foreign policy has been marked by lack of any broad  vision of the interest and values that underpin the Western  Alliance and Australia's role in it.

Foreign policy under a Howard Government will be based on a  realistic assessment of our role in the international  community.

It will provide Australia with a realistic, coherent foreign  policy based on a clear assessment of our national  interests. .
