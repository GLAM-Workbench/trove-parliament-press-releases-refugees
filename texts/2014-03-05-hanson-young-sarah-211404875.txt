Greens’ inquiry into Manus Island attack to go  ahead   The Australian Greens’ inquiry into the attack on the Manus Island detention camp, which resulted  in the death of Reza Barati, has been supported by the Senate.

“Today we have secured the only genuinely independent investigation into Reza Barati’s death,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“A man has died in the Australian Government’s care and anything less than a Parliamentary Inquiry  would have been grossly insufficient.

“It was disappointing, though not surprising, to see the Liberal Party once again vote against  transparency and accountability in an attempt to continue its cover-up campaign.

“Through this inquiry the workers who were there that night and the refugees who were attacked  will have the opportunity to tell their stories, free form the Government’s gag order.

“It’s essential for us to find out exactly what happened that night and the Government’s internal  review, as part of its coordinated whitewash, is simply not good enough.”
