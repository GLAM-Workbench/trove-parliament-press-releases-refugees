AID FOR DRUG PREVENTION

"Senior Laotian Government officials have told the Australian  MP Task Force that they are seeking additional Australian aid  project to help combat narcotic production.in the Laos section  '  of the Golden Triangle.

"Senior Laotian Government officials told a Federal Coalition  Task Force on Drugs and Refugees, in Vientiane this week that  the aid project was needed to help encourage Lao farmers to Â· grow alternative crops under irrigation. Officials considered  drug abuse to. be basically a western problem, but acknowledge  more reliable self-sufficiency in food production linked to

reduced opium growing, would offer goals which met both Laos .   and Australian objectives."

The Task Force, consisting of Federal Members of Parliament  Alan Cadman, Tim Fischer and John Sharp, were told that the  Laos Government was actively trying to limit the growth and  use of drugs.

"Laos is one of the world's largest producers of opium for heroin,  '  and would continue to be so unless there are alternative and  profitable crops available for farmers.

"Australia is currently assisting Laos with a major irrigation  project in areas away from the Golden Triangle, in a scheme, Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  -  .costing $5 million. .  Â·  -

"The Task Force is visiting a number of countries in the South  East Asian region, with a dual purpose of investigating drugs  and immigration problems, and will be returning later this  week.

"The Task Force has been encouraged by the efforts that Thailand  and Laos were making to reduce.drug problems, and would be  proposing recommendations upon their return."
