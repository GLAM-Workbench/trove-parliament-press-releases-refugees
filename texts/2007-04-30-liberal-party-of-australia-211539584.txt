Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship





Visit to Indonesia

Monday, 30 April 2007

I will visit Indonesia from 1 to 3 May where I will meet my counterpart, Dr  Hamid Awaludin, Minister for Law and Human Rights.

I will also have discussions with Foreign Minister, Dr Hassan Wirajuda and  senior parliamentary members, as well as meet regional representatives of  the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Australia and Indonesia have a close and effective immigration relationship.  Since June 2006, Indonesian immigration authorities have intercepted around  350 persons who were planning to travel to Australia illegally.

We are natural partners in the regional fight against people smugglers. My  Department and the Australian Federal Police are currently working with the  Indonesian police and immigration agencies on a proposal for a joint people  smuggling taskforce.

I will be discussing with Indonesian Parliamentarians our respective programs  to combat people smuggling.

These efforts to strengthen our borders and our joint investment in more  sophisticated detection of irregular movement complement the high priority we  place on these issues.

I intend to discuss what we can do to build on our existing cooperation in this  area.
