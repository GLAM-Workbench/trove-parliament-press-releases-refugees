Labor welcomes news Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian refugee, journalist and  award-winning writer, has had the opportunity to depart Papua New Guinea.

We look forward for Mr Boochani having the opportunity to permanently resettle in  a third country as soon as possible, wherever that may be.

Labor has been calling on the third term Morrison Government to resettle eligible  refugees in PNG and Nauru for close to six years.

In recent weeks, we have seen refugees in PNG and Nauru resettle in Canada  under the country’s community sponsorship program thanks to the generous  support of Canadian sponsors - as well as Australians living there.

Refugees have been languishing in indefinite detention for six years because of  Peter Dutton’s sheer incompetence to negotiate practical and durable third country  resettlement options.

Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement deal and encourages all  refugees who have been offered resettlement under that deal to accept the offer.

The Morrison Government should open discussions with New Zealand, negotiate  appropriate conditions similar to that of the US deal, and accept their long standing  offer to resettle eligible refugees.

New Zealand’s generous offer was first negotiated by former Prime Minister Julia  Gillard and former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key in 2013.

It is clear Australia can have strong borders without being weak on humanity.
