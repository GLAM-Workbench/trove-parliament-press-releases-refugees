TERMS OF REFERENCE - REVIEW OF THE

ADULT MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAM

The Government's policy in regard to adult migrant education  i s : '

. to ensure that migrants on arrival in A u s t r a l i a ,

and subsequently, have access to information  essential to their successful settlement in  Australia;

. to recognise that a critical need of non-English

speaking migrants (including refugees) is the  ability to communicate in English; and

. to accept that all adults who do not communicate

in English adequately for their needs must have  the opportunity to learn English.

These policies are largely implemented through the Adult  Migrant Education Program (AMEP).

The AMEP is part of the Commonwealth's post arrival programs  and services for migrants. It provides English language  learning opportunities for non-English speaking migrants and  orientation information to new settlers. It is administered  by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and  delivered by State and Territory educational authorities and

some tertiary institutions.

Within that context, the Review will 1
