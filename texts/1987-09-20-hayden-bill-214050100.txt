AID TO PNG-IRIAN JAVA BORDER CROSSERS

The Australian Government will contribute $900,000 in 1987/88 towards the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) program of care for border  crossers from Man Jay a in Papua New Guinea, the Acting Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced today.

It is estimated that about 9,500 border crossers are still in Papua New Guinea. A  program of relocation, away from the border to East Awin, began last month under  the direction of the UNHCR and the PNG Government. It is expected that between  400 and 450 border crossers will be moved each month until the end of the year.

Senator Evans said that Australia's participation in the project is tangible evidence  of the Government's concern for the border crossers which is helping to reduce  border tensions and ease the pressure for resettlement.

Australia has made a significant contribution to the care and maintenance of the  border crossers since the situation became an international concern. So far  Australia's contribution to the program has totalled $4 million which represents  about half the total cost.
