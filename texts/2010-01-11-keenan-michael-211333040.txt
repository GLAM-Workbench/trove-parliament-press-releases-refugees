NO VACANCIES ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND - SO WHERE TO NEXT?

Mr Michael Keenan MP

Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Michael Keenan has today called on the Rudd

Government to reveal how they intend to accommodate the growing number of asylum seekers, as facilities on

Christmas Island hit breaking point.

“The Rudd Government needs to reveal how much further the facilities on Christmas Island can be stretched

before they collapse,” said Mr Keenan.

“Boats are arriving at an almost daily rate; the Government needs to come clean with the Australian people and

outline their contingency plan to deal with arrivals once Christmas Island hits capacity.”

“If they don’t have a plan, they better get one soon.”

Mr Keenan’s warning follows the interception of another unauthorised arrival yesterday afternoon 4.8 nautical

miles north of Christmas Island, making it the fourth this year.

Since the Rudd Government’s changes in August 2008, 74 unauthorised boats have arrived in Australian waters,

with 3,105 people on board.

“The facilities at Christmas Island are already heavily reliant on the use of tents to house its occupants, but even

this makeshift solution has its limits.”

“As the surge in arrivals continues to pick up momentum, when can we expect the Government to start

processing people on the mainland?”

“At the rate the boats are coming, surely it’s only a matter of time.”
