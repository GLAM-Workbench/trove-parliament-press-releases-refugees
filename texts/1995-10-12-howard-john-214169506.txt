THE COALITION’S ASIA FOCUS

Address by the Hon. John Howard MP, Leader of the Opposition  Asia-Australia Institute, 12 October 1995, Sydney

I am delighted to be addressing the Asia-Australia Institute this evening on the Liberal and  National Parties' priorities for Australia’s relationship with Asia. I am particularly pleased  to be giving this address to a forum which has, in the past few years, been at the forefront of  encouraging a greater awareness in Australia of the importance of Asia to our future.

The Coalition places a strong emphasis on the Asian region. We recognise its vital  importance for Australia's long-term interests.

We welcome our growing interaction with the peoples of the region. Both Australia and  Asia can learn much from each other through links of culture, language, education and  tourism.

Australia's challenge for its future is to create an environment conducive to sustained strong  economic growth. To take up the challenge we need a reference point, a benchmark against  which we can judge our national performance.

We are very fortunate to be living on the edge of the world's fastest growing and most  dynamic economic region.

As such, an excellent reference point for Australia is the Asia-Pacific region. The growth in  the region is a cause for optimism about its future and demands the energy and interest of  Australian policy-makers.

Realising the full potential of our interaction with the Asia-Pacific provides Australia with  an historic challenge. A Coalition Government will be totally committed to providing the  policy framework in which we can meet that goal.

A deep involvement with the nations of the Asia-Pacific region should be seen for what it is  - a bipartisan “given” in the conduct of Australian foreign policy.

In the lead-up to a critical federal election, it is important to emphasise differences between  the major political parties. It is equally important, however, to recognise where differences  do not exist on issues important to the national interest and to carefully eschew attempts to  manufacture artificial policy disputes.

The point at issue here is not whether both the Government and the Opposition Parties have  a strong commitment to links with the region. Rather it is how best to give effect to a  mutually-held strong commitment.

> . -

In that context I have never disputed the importance placed by the current Government on  our regional ties. What I continue to reject are the rather tawdry attempts by the Prime  Minister and his colleagues to depict themselves as those great Australian statesmen who  “discovered" Asia. They did no such thing.

And I specifically repudiate the attempt of the Prime Minister to depict my recent Defence  statement as evidence that the Coalition was somehow frightened of Asia, or sought to  reduce the importance of Asia to Australia's future.

Their attempts have been a prime example of that Orwellian observation - that those who  seek to control the future first try to control the past. That is, they try to distort it for their  own particular narrow purposes.

Over recent decades all Australian Governments, both Coalition and Labor, have made  important contributions to expanding Australia’s economic and political interaction with the  Asia-Pacific region.

I acknowledge all their achievements. I diminish none of them. I commit a future  Coalition Government to building further on them.

Tonight is not the first time I have addressed the subject of Australia's links with Asia.  Earlier this year I gave the fifth Asialink Lecture in Melbourne where I set out my  assessment of the region’s current dynamics of change and identified the tremendous  opportunities in Asia for Australia.

These changes have been a major watershed in the evolution of Australian foreign policy. In  my lifetime, they have been dwarfed only by the extraordinary implosion of communism,  which represented the most decisive victory of one set of ideas over another seen in this  century.

This evening, my focus is on how Australia can continue to strengthen and deepen its  relationship with our Asian neighbours. Enhancing Australia’s relations with Asia will  receive the highest foreign policy priority from a Coalition Government.

However, in saying this, the Coalition will not neglect our strong ties with our traditional  friends, allies and important trading partners - the United States, New Zealand, the United  Kingdom and Europe. We believe that a sensible foreign policy must take into account  Australia’s global interests, whilst recognising that Asia is fundamental to that foreign

policy.

Asia's importance to Australia

Asia’s phenomenal economic growth is ample testimony to the industriousness of the states  of Asia and their determination to provide their people with an economically secure future.

i f 3

Asia's powerful economic growth puts Australia's economic performance in perspective. In  1994 North Asia grew at an average rate of 4.1 percent, and in South East Asia average  growth was 7.8 percent. If these growth rates are sustained over the coming years, income  levels and living standards in the region will continue to rise dramatically.

The resulting trade and economic opportunities make Asia a vital region not just for  Australia, but for ipuch of the world.

The region offers Australian businesses enormous opportunities in terms of two-way  investment and trade. Six of our top ten trading partners are in Asia. Around sixty percent  of Australia's exports are destined for Asian markets.

But it is not just trade and economic opportunities which are important

We value the increase in people-to-people links between Australia and Asia which will  further enhance mutual understanding. Growing cultural, education and business ties mean  that our futures are increasingly integrated. Australia's own population has a significant  Asian component which enhances our ties to the region.

Australia’s future security depends on the promotion of a stable regional environment. We  recognise that in the post-Coid War era our strategic environment is potentially less  predictable and more complex than in the past, but that the maintenance of regional peace  and stability is a common regional goal.

As I said last week in my Statement on Defence priorities, the Coalition is committed to  enhancing Australia's security links with South East Asia and North Asia, as well as with  our traditional allies.

Asia’s importance to Australia is obvious and a Coalition Government will welcome the  opportunity to further strengthen our relationship.

Our proud history of interaction with Asia

Australians have immense pride in our history, our values and our way of life. They are  what set us apart and provide us with a distinctive Australian identity.

The Coalition Parties have a clear set of priorities to advance Australia’s long-term interests.  We do not believe that Australia faces some kind of exclusive choice between our past and  our future, between our history and our geography. We see such a choice as a phoney and  irrelevant one proposed by those with ulterior motives.

We do not have to abandon or apologise for our heritage to contribute to Asia and to  welcome Asia’s importance to our future. Australia is integral to the future of this region,  but we must work to enhance mutual understanding - between Australia and Asia - to ensure  that these relationships are founded on the strongest basis.

4

This has been a Coalition aim for the past fifty years. Asia has been an important priority in  our foreign policy approach for that entire period.

The early framework for Australia’s relations with Asia was established by former Liberal  Governments. In some instances, the initiatives at the time were undertaken against  significant Labor opposition.

Let me highlight a few examples of governing Coalition Parties’ contributions to our region.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Foreign Minister Richard Casey, on 31 December 1954, recognised Asia as a  foreign policy priority by saying "Our own special role, however, lies in Asia and  the Pacific and consequently our foreign policy is largely but not exclusively  concerned with that region"; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Harold Holt was the first Australian Prime Minister to make Asia his first  overseas visit.

Coalition Governments were responsible for

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ developing educational links with Asia, in particular initiating the Colombo Plan;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ contributing to the development of regional security alliances designed to enhance  stability - such as ANZUS and the Five Power Defence Arrangements;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ establishing Australia’s long-term partnership with Japan to enhance bilateral  trade and economic relations and signing the Japan-Australia 1957 trade agreement  which the Labor Party opposed;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ together with Japan, painstakingly developing the framework for regional  economic cooperation, without which APEC would not have been possible.  Australia and Japan established the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (now  Council) in 1982 which was the precursor to APEC;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ abandoning the “White Australia" policy in favour of a progressively non-racial  immigration policy in the 1950s and 1960s; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ committing to one of the most compassionate responses in the world to the  Indochina refugee crisis.

A Liberal/National Government will continue this proud history of contributing to the  promotion of the security and development of the region.

This evening I would like to indicate how a Coalition Government will continue to  emphasise mutually beneficial relationships with our partners in Asia.

I

I will focus on five key areas:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The state of our current regional relationships; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ APEC; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The need for strong bilateral ties;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition’s emphases in East Asia; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Regional security priorities.

The state of our current regional relationships

As I have said, the issue is not whether Australia should engage with Asia. That has been  the Coalition’s approach for many decades.

The issue is what is the most effective way to manage our relations with Asia and how to  build further on ourÂ·Asian relationships from where we are today.

The Coalition has concerns about Australia’s trade performance in the region.

Australia is not maintaining its share of regional trade at a time when regional economies are  growing strongly. We are losing the race in many important export markets as Australia is  simply not competitive.

Government ministers never seem to tire of talking about the increase in manufactured  exports since the mid-1980s. What they fail to mention is that our share of East Asia's total  imports - our fastest growing market - is actually lower than in 1983, when it was 3.8  percent.

Ten years later, Australia's share of East Asian imports had dropped to 3.1 percent at a time  when economic growth in Asia is accelerating. This is a loss of billions of dollars.

In those ten years we have lost market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia,  Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei.

And in the last year, Australia’s trade growth with Asia has further slowed,

Australia is not fully capitalising on the growth in Asia. Not only does Australia need to  actively develop new markets in Asia, but we must ensure that our economic  competitiveness is significantly improved.

The focus must be on a thorough program of domestic micro-economic reform, higher and  better quality investment, innovation and business risk-taking.

Our regional trade share is not the Coalition's only concern.

6

Especially in South East Asia, Australia’s bilateral foreign relations under the present  Government have been characterised by a vulnerability to political upsets which makes  predictability in relationships often difficult to achieve.

For example, the Government's incompetent handling of the appointment of a new  Indonesian ambassador to Australia has caused both Indonesia and Australia unnecessary  embarrassment.

It is clearly not in Australia’s interests to have such an important neighbour as Indonesia  without an ambassador to this country.

One of the Coalition’s priorities will be to work to ensure that the chances of such  unnecessary difficulties in our bilateral relationship with Indonesia are minimised in the  future.

There are also strains in Australia’s relations with Malaysia.

Malaysia is a country with which Australia should have a solid relationship. We are linked  by ties of history, membership of the Commonwealth and comradeship in the theatre of war.

Malaysia and Australia have considerable people to people links. Malaysian students  comprise the largest number of overseas students studying in Australia. Through the Five  Power Defence Arrangements, Australia and Malaysia are linked in a defence agreement

which has continuing value to both countries as well as our other partners.

Yet the Prime Minister has not visited Malaysia during his time in office.

The Coalition recognises the importance of effective diplomacy. We believe that the best  results for Australia and the region can be achieved through persuasion and negotiation, and  should be based on mutual understanding of each other’s interests.

APEC

The Coalition recognises APEC's potential to provide the regional economy with enormous  benefits. We also recognise the importance of greater business involvement in APEC.

We are proud that it was a Coalition initiative which provided the foundations for APEC.  As I have already mentioned, it was Australia and Japan which over many years nurtured the  idea of regional economic cooperation.

This culminated in a meeting between the then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser  and the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Ohira in Canberra in 1980 which led to the tripartite -  academic, business and government - Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC).

\

I remind everyone that it was the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference which provided  the foundations for APEC’s first meeting in Canberra in November 1989. APEC had been  in existence for four years before Mr Keating claimed it as his own at the Seattle Leaders'  Meeting in 1993.

The Coalition remains committed to the development of APEC.

And the benefits of APEC to Australia will be reinforced by our commitment to domestic  micro-economic reform to improve the competitiveness of our economy.

The Liberal and National parties welcomed the 1994 Bogor commitment to "open  regionalism". We believe that dismantling barriers to trade and investment in the Asia-  Pacific is the key to sustaining the high levels of growth experienced in the region.

We also emphasise that trade liberalisation needs to be conducted on a non-discriminatory  basis. The Coalition believes that a regional preferential trading arrangement must be  rejected by Australia and the countries of the Asia-Pacific. .

I am extremely concerned by reports that Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan are  pressing for the exclusion of agriculture from the APEC action plan at Osaka. Such a  development would be completely inimical to Australia’s interests. The Coalition will  strenuously resist such moves.

Our agricultural sector is amongst the most efficient and least protected in the world and sets  an excellent example of what can be achieved.

It is in Australia's best interests that efforts to liberalise regional trade be on a comprehensive  basis. There should be no sectoral exclusions - participation in this process should be on the  basis that all participants are willing to remove barriers and encourage mutually beneficial  trade flows.

The Government must ensure that Australia's national interests are promoted at Osaka and  use Senator McMullan's trip to Japan this week to make our opposition to the exclusion of  agriculture patently clear.

The need for strong bilateral ties

The Coalition will continue to strongly support the evolution of an Asia-Pacific style of  regionalism - through APEC and through the ASEAN Regional Forum. But we recognise  that for the foreseeable future regional multilateral organisations will not be able to solve all  of the more sensitive regional issues.

A country like Australia must make difficult choices about how it can make best use of its  limited diplomatic and political resources to protect and advance our national interests.

We must place high priority on promoting substantial bilateral relations with the countries of  the Asia-Pacific region.

8

This is the bedrock on which we can build regional approaches like the ASEAN Regional  Forum and APEC. Our aims in these fora will be advanced if they are based on a confident  relationship with each of our regional neighbours.

The Coalition recognises that each of our relationships with the countries o f Asia is unique.  Each will require a different mix of policy and priority to take full advantage of the  opportunities inherent in every bilateral relationship. This applies not just to Australia’s  relations with Asian states, but throughout the world.

A Coalition Government will emphasise bilateral trade ties and will work to facilitate market  access for Australian businesses on a bilateral basis.

Whilst we strengthen bilateral relations, a Coalition Government will continue to pursue  Australia's national interests at all levels, including through multilateral institutions and  regional groupings.

Emphases in East Asia

The Coalition recognises that many of Australia's most important bilateral relationships are  with East Asian states.

Our trade and economic interests in strengthening relations with Asia are compelling. For  instance:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Japan is our largest trading partner; South Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan and  Hong Kong are in our top ten; and Indonesia is our eleventh largest trade partner.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Indonesia and China, among others, are likely to become even more significant  trading partners as they experience rapid rates of growth.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia has a crucial economic relationship with Japan. It should never be taken  for granted.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We recognise the immense potential in the China - Hong Kong - Taiwan dynamic  growth area and will develop policies to better exploit these opportunities.

Asia is vital to our future security and political interests.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia values Indonesia's responsible leadership role in South East Asia and its  encouragement of the discussion of regional security concerns through the  ASEAN Regional Forum.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We recognise the importance of defence and security ties between Australia and  South East Asia, as well as the need to upgrade security links with North Asia.

9

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia has long worked with Japan to promote regional economic cooperation  and a range of other issues, and we value that association for the benefits it brings  to both.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition is aware of the concerns in parts of the region about the direction of  China’s defence and security development. We will work to ensure that China is  closely involved in regional processes - political, economic and security - so that  it has a clear stake in the region’s future stability.

The Coalition recognises that Australia and some countries of the region differ in the priority  placed on a number of fundamental values. Notwithstanding this:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Coalition Government will not hesitate to raise our concerns when necessary,  not just about human rights but about other issues of concern - such as China's  nuclear testing. These concerns will be raised in the context of the totality of our  bilateral relationships.

Through good diplomacy and strengthening trade and security ties, the Coalition believes  that more mature, predictable and consistent bilateral relations are possible with Asia which  will better reflect our important mutual interests.

The Coalition will work at the ministerial level and officials-level to identify ways to further  strengthen these vital relationships.

The Coalition also believes that a compelling priority for Australia is the need to recognise  more generally the importance to Australia's future of the countries of North Asia.

For instance South Korea has recently overtaken the United States as Australia’s second-  largest export market.

However I recognise that the Australia-South Korea bilateral relationship is limited in every  other area apart from trade. The people of South Korea and Australia know virtually nothing  about each other. A Coalition Government will seek to develop greater bilateral political,  cultural and educational links.

The Coalition believes that Australia’s economic, political and security interests mean that  we must ensure that our foreign policy places adequate emphasis on North Asia.

The Coalition believes it is possible to do this without diminishing the dynamism of our  relations with South East Asia and our commitment to the development of regional  mechanisms such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

Regional security priorities,

An important and positive security feature of the region is its web o f bilateral and  multilateral alliances, many of which are underpinned by the United States. The Coalition  recognises that in this time of regional transition - from the Cold War to an as yet unclear  alternative - the stabilising role of the United States in the Asia-Pacific is important.

It is vital to ensure that the United States remains engaged in the region. It is important to  emphasise here that there is general support throughout Asia for a strong United States  regional security presence.

The Coalition is committed to enhancing our security links to the region - both in South East  Asia and North Asia. Working with the region to enhance stability and security has been a  long-standing Coalition priority and will remain one.

The Coalition also values the emerging role of the ASEAN Regional Forum in providing the  opportunity for discussion of some of the less difficult regional security issues. We will  continue to strongly support the ASEAN Regional Forum's development.

We recognise that the evolution of the ASEAN Regional Forum is likely to be gradual,  reflecting the differences in security interests and priorities throughout the region. Success  will come through, mutual recognition of these differences and we appreciate the role  consensus plays in these issues.

However, the ASEAN Regional Forum is not the only way we will work to promote a secure  regional environment. We will enhance bilateral security ties with our partners in South  East Asia, and further develop our links with North Asia. Maintenance of existing defence  ties such as ANZUS and the Five Power Defence Arrangements will be an important

Coalition commitment to a stable regional future.

The Coalition believes an integrated approach to regional security will best serve Australia’s  interests.

Conclusion

The Coalition recognises that the Asian region is vital to our future prosperity as within it lie  many of Australia's greatest trade and economic opportunities. Asia is also vital to our  future security.

A Coalition Government will contribute to the region by:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ supporting political change as regional states make the transition to democracy;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ continuing our deep concern with the promotion of universal values which are  fundamental to individual freedom and dignity;

11

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ where there are clear violations of universal standards of human rights, taking them up  directly with the government concerned. In this area, as in so many others in foreign  policy, the need is one of balance and integration with other concerns and interests that  together constitute Australia's vital interests;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ welcoming and encouraging the development of closer education, cultural and people-to-  people links with our regional neighbours;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ensuring that our overseas development assistance program is appropriately targeted to  those at the community level who are most in need of assistance;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ recognising the impact of transnational issues - such as the plight of refugees, degradation  of the environment, the growing regional problem of HIV/AIDS, trafficking in illegal  drugs, and the spread of organised crime. We will work with our neighbours to address  these problems; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ promoting Australia's national interests by developing more substantial bilateral relations  with our regional neighbours and supporting the development of regional approaches  such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

Through these measures a Coalition Government will develop Australia's relationship with  Asia based on mutual respect and understanding of each other's priorities and interests. It is  not a one way relationship. Australia and the countries of Asia have much they can  contribute to each other and the benefits of this today are greater than they have ever been.

It is this approach that the Coalition believes will provide Australia with the strongest basis  on which to pursue its national interests in the future.
