East Timor: Death Of New Zealand Soldier Laurie Brereton - Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

Media Statement - 25 July 2000

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today expressed deep concern over the death in combat of a New Zealand soldier in East Timor.

"This first combat-related fatality of a UN peacekeeper in East Timor highlights the continuing problem of the security along the international border between East Timor West Timor", Mr Brereton said.

"Despite repeated promises of action, the Indonesian military have failed to disarm or disband the militia groups which continue to intimidate East Timorese refugees and conduct incursions across the border into East Timor."

"These violent efforts to destabilise East Timor must be terminated without further delay."

"Foreign Minister Downer should pursue this issue when he meets his Indonesian counterpart, Dr Alwi Shihab, in Bangkok this week."

"Mr Downer must make it clear to Dr Shihab that militia incursions across the border into East Timor are unacceptable."

"Those responsible for violating East Timor's territorial integrity and attacking UN peacekeepers must be identified and brought to account."

"At the same time, urgent action is required by the Indonesian authorities to completely disarm and disband all the militia groups and accelerate the repatriation of East Timorese refugees from their camps in West Timor."
