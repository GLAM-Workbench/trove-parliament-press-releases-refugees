Funding boost for young artists and creative leaders

A hip hop festival, traditional Aboriginal art workshops and a national poetry competition are among  20 projects for young people to receive funding under the latest round of the Gillard GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  Youth Development and Support Program (YDSP).

Minister for Youth Peter Garrett said more than $450,000 was being provided for this yearÃ¢ÂÂs  successful projects, with the funding going to not-for-profit community-based or national youth  organisations.  This yearÃ¢ÂÂs grants were targeted to projects involving the arts and creative  enterprises, with a particular focus on Indigenous young people.

“I was really impressed with the quality of the projects this year, and look forward to seeing them  come to life over the next few months,” he said.

“Today is also International Youth Day, when young people around the world are encouraged to  celebrate their achievements while raising awareness in the broader community about the range of  issues facing todayÃ¢ÂÂs youth.”

The Youth Development and Support Program provides funding each year for projects for young  people, to build their leadership skills and develop connections between young people and their  communities.

Projects to be funded this year include:

Ã¯ÂÂ· A hip hop summit in the Northern Rivers region of NSW, organised by Creative PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs  Collective. Ã¢ÂÂBeats and RootsÃ¢ÂÂ will help young people from different backgrounds come  together to share their talents, and is receiving more than $16,000 in funding.

Ã¯ÂÂ· The Waltja Tjutangku Palyapayi Aboriginal Corporation in WA is receiving more than  $18,000 to run a series of art workshops, in which local elders will pass on their traditional  skills to the younger generation.   Ã¯ÂÂ· The Open Channel Co-Operative in Moonee Valley, Victoria, is receiving over $18,000 for a

short film project that will produce a web-based anti-bullying series.

Mr Garrett said the YDSP is part of the Gillard GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to increasing the  wellbeing and building the resilience of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs youth.

“Last year the Government launched the National Strategy for Young Australians, which aims to  empower young people, develop their abilities, and build a healthier and safer country for young  people,” he said.

“As part of this weÃ¢ÂÂve committed $10 million to build five Arts, Business and Community Centres for  Young Australians; weÃ¢ÂÂve provided funding to a range of projects and schemes to develop young  peopleÃ¢ÂÂs community connections and provide activities and support; and weÃ¢ÂÂve established a  National Youth Policing Model.

“In November we held the Australian Youth-Led Convention in Canberra, where more than 80  delegates from around the country came together to share ideas and provide advice to the  Government on engaging young people in policy.

“WeÃ¢ÂÂre taking that advice on board as part of our plans to help younger Australians be safe, strong,  and smart.”
