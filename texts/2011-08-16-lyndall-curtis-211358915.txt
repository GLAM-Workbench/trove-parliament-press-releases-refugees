16 August 2011

LYNDALL CURTIS: To discuss the day's events, I've been joined by Labor Parliamentary  Secretary, Richard Marles, and Liberal MP, Scott Buchholz.

Welcome to you both.

RICHARD MARLES: Thank you, Lyndall.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Hi, Lyndall.

LYNDALL CURTIS: Richard, if I could ask you first a question without notice about your  portfolio responsibilities for Pacific Island Affairs, Papua New Guinea has agreed in principle  to re-opening the asylum seeker processing centre on Manus Island. How advanced are  negotiations on the detail?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, the decision that was taken by the PNG Government last week  has really opened the door for those discussions.

We're in discussions with them now and officials will be going there this week to continue  those and we're hopeful they can be completed quickly.

I don't want to put a timeframe on that, but we feel optimistic about being able to complete  them quickly.

I met with (PNG Prime Minister) Peter O'Neill on Friday evening and he was very supportive  of what we're trying to do there, so we're moving ahead, full steam ahead.

LYNDALL CURTIS: One of your colleagues, Anna Burke, on this program yesterday,  expressed concern about the Malaysian deal and Manus Island. Do you believe those  concerns are widespread within the caucus?

RICHARD MARLES: No, I don't think so. I heard Anna's comments and obviously respect  her view, but I don't think it's a widely held view within the caucus.

I think we all understand that the model that underpins people smuggling simply has to be  broken.

There's nothing compassionate about encouraging people to get on leaky boats.

We have got a solution that will see 4000 more people come to Australia under the refugee  intake. That's a real win in terms of what Australian can do for the international problem of  those seeking asylum. But it happens in an ordered way if we do it that way.

I think people within the caucus understand that and they support what we're doing.

LYNDALL CURTIS: We'll move on now to the day's events.

Scott, the Coalition focused all day on the broken promise from the prime minister, but Tony  Abbott also told the Coalition party room that while people are entitled to be angry about the  government, MPs have a duty to exercise a calming influence and that he didn't want the  country to be reduced to two warring camps.

Does the Coalition hold any responsibility for fuelling that anger?

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: No, absolutely not, absolutely not. I mean, the campaign that's been  waged is that the Coalition has gone off on this negative campaign and a fear campaign.

Well let me tell the people of Australia that I suspect that the majority of the fear of this  debate was brought about by not releasing the information early in the piece, not releasing  how much it was going to be, not releasing the impact that it was going to have on the family  budget, not releasing whether or not it was going be a thousand businesses or who was  actually going to pay for it.

I suspect that the fear was actually driven from the Labor camp and so to turn the debate we  ended up with a [indistinct] tag.

LYNDALL CURTIS: So do you think the fear will die down now those details are out?

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: No, no I don't. Well, is the information out? Who are the 500  businesses that are going to be contributing to the tax, and the prime minister has said herself  that some of them may choose to pass the actual cost on.

Well I challenge the prime minister to tell me which one of those businesses will not pass the  price on to mums and dads and business houses of Australia.

LYNDALL CURTIS: Richard, was the promise by the prime minister that there wouldn't be  a carbon tax under a government she led the most damaging for you? It's really blunted your  message on carbon the whole way through, hasn't it?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, the prime minister made clear in the lead up to the last election  that we supported an emissions trading scheme and that we supported putting a price on  carbon. And that's the fact of the matter.

And yeah, people can focus on that particular phrase, but if you step back a moment and have  a look at what we've always stood for, it's been completely clear and completely consistent.

Before the 2007 election, we stood for an emissions trading scheme. Actually, in those days,  John Howard did as well.

In the last term of government we committed as much political capital to this issue as any  other and now what we're doing is implementing an emissions trading scheme which, sure,  has [indistinct]…

LYNDALL CURTIS: [Interrupts] But the process would have been easier without that  promise, wouldn't it?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, firstly I think there is a difference in terms of a long term  carbon tax to what we're talking about now. Sure, there is - in the first three years - a fixed  price in terms of the emissions trading scheme, but we end up with an emissions trading

scheme. That's what we said we would do and that's what we've always said we would do,  and the prime minister has been consistent on that.

Now if you want to look at inconsistency, look at the other side of politics. John Howard  supported it, Malcolm Turnbull supported it and then we've got Tony Abbott who has run just  the most appalling scare campaign we've ever seen.

I mean you really can't be sure what his view is in relation to whether he accepts the climate  science or not, but there's this blanket opposition to doing anything.

When we really know that on Scott's side of politics, half their team actually do want to see  an emissions trading scheme.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Look, your own deputy leader, your treasurer…

RICHARD MARLES: Your team want to see it.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: …Wayne Swan…

RICHARD MARLES: So you've got an enormous inconsistency on the conservative side of  politics about this, so I actually think we've been the ones who have been entirely consistent  in relation to this and we will see an emissions trading scheme which is what we said we'd  do.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Let me tell you how consistent your message has been. On 12  August, on the 7:30 Report, your deputy leader, Wayne Swan, was asked on the issue of  carbon tax, this was his response, we have made our position very clear, we've ruled it out.

Again, on 15 August, Meet the Press, Channel 10, the journalist asked of Wayne Swan can  you tell us exactly when Labor will apply a price to the carbon. Wayne Swan's response was  well certainly we reject this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a

carbon tax, we reject that.

So you can't say that you guys are united in your position on the carbon tax. You were all  over the place like…

RICHARD MARLES: We have been supporting a price on carbon since before the 2007  election. That's just a fact.

If you look at what we were saying in the lead up to the 2010 election, we supported putting a  price on carbon.

Now, okay…

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Senior ministers come out and denounced it. Your two senior  leaders denounced it.

RICHARD MARLES: They were talking in the context of a carbon tax.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: How else can I interpretate(*) that?

RICHARD MARLES: They're talking about the context of a carbon tax. It is true that the  result of the election has put us in a position of minority government, you come up with a  compromise, but it's a compromise which leads to an emissions trading scheme, a price on  carbon after three years which is what we said we would do.

LYNDALL CURTIS: If we could move on to the economy, the Reserve Bank's warned  about inflationary pressures, particularly if productivity growth isn't boosted, about  consumers cutting back spending, about international uncertainty.

The treasurer, too, has been warning about international uncertainty and the language from  the government, Richard, on meeting the surplus target in 2012/2013 seems to have changed.  It's now a target, an objective. You say you're determined to get there.

Will the government actually meet its surplus target and deliver a surplus in the budget?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, it has always been our objective to have a surplus in the  2012/13 budget and it remains our objective to do so.

You know, we are seeing global economic uncertainty with sovereign debt in Europe and, of  course, the issue around the debt ceiling in the US, so this is going to make the task more  difficult, no question about that, but it absolutely remains our objective and we'll pursue it.

But let's look at the other side of politics here. When it comes to the management of  economic issues, we have seen this kind of reckless promising like a drunken sailor which  has led the Liberal Party to have a $70 billion black hole which they conceded…

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: [Interrupts] [Laughs] How many houses - I mean how many houses  did you burn down.

RICHARD MARLES: Do you know how much $70 billion is? Like the New South, the  entire New South Wales budget is $57 billion. [Indistinct]…

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: The question was about your surplus. Let's talk about your surplus.

RICHARD MARLES: The entire South Australian budget is $16 billion. Combine South  Australia and New South Wales. I mean we're talking the entire budgets of $73 billion. Is the  plan to just turn off the lights in Adelaide and Sydney?

LYNDALL CURTIS: Hang on, Scott. We'll talk about that leaked Opposition documents  that you've got $70 billion to find. That would mean, in part, reversing all of the spending  from the carbon and mining taxes.

As a Queensland MP, are you happy if infrastructure spending for Queensland, paid for by  the mining tax, doesn't go ahead?

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: I haven't seen the document, but I suspect that there'll be no, or very  little, opposition in cutting eight new departments set up to administer a carbon tax that with,  with all intent may not even change the temperature of the globe.

LYNDALL CURTIS: But in the mining tax, the mining tax funds infrastructure projects,  some of them are in Queensland.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: There are…

LYNDALL CURTIS: Would you be happy if that spending doesn't go ahead?

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: There are other ways where we can access mining resources tax,  through state government legislation, through royalties. The mining companies, when you  speak to them, you know, on a - they would much prefer that, there's more certainty there for  them as opposed to this particular tax.

We will scrap the resources tax and we will still continue to build infrastructure with money  that hasn't been wasted.

But can I go back to the point of the three and a half billion surplus that the government  intends to bring in on 2012/13?

Now for those punters out there, do you know when that is? It's not the next election, it's not  the next budget, it's the one after.

So, at 2013, you guys bring forward a surplus, a forecasted surplus of three and a half billion,  with the amount of peak borrowings that you've got and have forecasted in your estimates, it

will take you about 50 years, 50 years at the same economic management, to repay back the  debt that you have incurred.

LYNDALL CURTIS: Scott, I might just interrupt. So you're completely happy with the  spending that the carbon and mining taxes will fund for tax cuts, pension rises, for  infrastructure payments? You're happy if that does not go ahead?

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: We will fund increases in pensions out of the savings that we will  find in not wasting taxpayers' money.

LYNDALL CURTIS: But 70 billion, even if you take into account, there's…

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: I don't know where the 70 billion come from, 70 billion's a big hit.

RICHARD MARLES: It is a big hit. It is absolutely a big hit, Scott, and you guys have  conceded it, which is the whole point here. I mean that's [indistinct]…

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: [Interrupts] Who said that? Who said it's 70 billion?

RICHARD MARLES: This is a confession, Scott, on the part of the Liberal Party that they  have completely lost control of their economic policy. They would not know how to balance  the books.

Do we really trust a party that has done this, to be behind the government's cash register in  these difficult economic times? That's the proposition which faces the Australian people.

LYNDALL CURTIS: But, Richard, as you say, they are difficult economic times, the  treasurer has said the global uncertainty will have an impact on the Australian economy.

If revenues are down, if unemployment is going up and you need to spend more helping those  unemployed people, can you really deliver a surplus at the same time? You'd have to cut  further into government spending if you did, wouldn't you?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, let's be clear, it's absolutely our objective to return the budget  to surplus.

It was actually the next budget, and yes, it is going to be a difficult task, there's no question  about that.

But we have a track record of being able to make difficult decisions and we've got a track  record of being able to engage in economic management.

I mean the other side of politics, when they needed to find $2 billion for the flood levy,  basically atomised over that issue because they are a populist party who could not make a  hard decision if their lives depended upon it.

So, the notion that they're going to be able to find $70 billion is completely ridiculous. At this  point in time, where there is economic uncertainty, they are the last people you'd want to trust  with the government's finances.

LYNDALL CURTIS: Scott…

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: A recent survey…

LYNDALL CURTIS: Scott, to find billions of dollars, you've got to look further than waste,  don't you? You've got to look at cutting government programmes.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Absolutely and we're on the record of saying that. We will trim and  cut new departments that we put in place for the carbon tax, we will trim up the public  service which has grown by the tune of about 22,000 under your leadership, at a federal level,  we will trim that up by 12,000.

RICHARD MARLES: So why is it so hard to find the $2 billion for the flood levy if it's so  easy to do these cuts?

LYNDALL CURTIS: Just let Scott finish his answer.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Yeah, I mean let's face it, from an economic perspective and looking  through the RBA papers the other day, I mean there's no doubt that the strength of the  economy at the moment is driven by the demand from China and India on our resources  sector.

I mean both sides of government have done it in the past, you know, when the market's going  great guns, then it's great fiscal management and, you know, when it's on a downward spiral,  it's monetary policy.

I just think - and I take heed from that recent survey by Essential, that when asked if the  Australian public, now the greater majority of them indicated that they would much prefer to  see the Coalition managing the economy.

RICHARD MARLES: What, with a $70 billion black hole? I doubt that.

LYNDALL CURTIS: Well, sorry, that's where we'll have to leave it, gentlemen.

Scott Buccholz and Richard, thank you very much for your time.

SCOTT BUCHHOLZ: Good on you.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks, Lyndall.
