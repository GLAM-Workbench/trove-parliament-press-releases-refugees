THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP  SHADOW TREASURER

TUESDAY 6 SEPTEMBER 2011  MTR - STEVE VIZARD & SUSIE O’BRIEN

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

STEVE VIZARD:

Joe Hockey joins me on the line. Joe, good to talk to you again.

JOE HOCKEY:

G’day Steve.

STEVE VIZARD:

Let’s start with these poll results. I guess they speak for themselves, but what would  you draw out of them Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, I think the Australian people can see through a bad government and this is the  worst government Australia has had in modern times with the worst Prime Minister  Australia has had in modern times.

SUSIE O’BRIEN:

Joe can I ask you one question. One of the things that she’s been greatly criticised on  is her handling of the asylum seeker issue, but the government’s and the opposition’s  policy on this and approach on this are almost identical. So why are you saying that,  would you argue that the Coalition would be any better in your handling of this  particular issue.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the problem is the policies are not identical. It was the government under Kevin  Rudd that reversed the temporary protection visas. It was the government under Kevin  Rudd that said he wouldn’t have a bar of offshore processing and Julia Gillard said  that Kevin Rudd’s government had lost its way and she was going to establish a new

processing centre on East Timor without asking their permission. That was certainly  not our policy and then when that failed she said she would do a deal with Malaysia.  Our party room is emphatic and clear. We support the processing of applications on  Nauru and we support temporary protection visas. We do not support anything else.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony Abbott of course Joe has offered to back the government if they want to go to  Nauru and he’s said that’s unconditional. He says it’s not conditional on the  government implementing temporary protection visas, or further boat resources or  anything of the sort. He said whatever the bare minimum the government says is  necessary to get a change to the migration act sufficient to get Nauru processing is  what he’ll support. Is that a political stunt or is he sincere about that?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s a real issue because the concern is that there is an armada of boats that may well  head towards Australia now that or policy is non existent. I mean our country has no  policy on border protection at the moment. It has no policy on the boats. The  Government’s policy has failed and they have no replacement policy, therefore the  policy that’s worked in then past, the policy that is the Coalition’s policy, is the most  obvious.

SUSIE O’BRIEN:

But the High Court’s ruling has put the Nauru solution also in jeopardy, so it’s hard to  see how that ruling would equally apply to Coalition policy, so you guys would be in  exactly the same position at this point.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the view expressed by a number of lawyers and even in the judgement of the  majority in the High Court decision was that Nauru was very different circumstances  to Malaysia and therefore it may well be the case that Nauru would stack up, but even  if it is in doubt, what Tony Abbott has offered in good faith is to support changes to  the law that would guarantee that Nauru would operate immediately. From our  perspective we have to make sure that Australia does not become a magnet for the  boats. Simple as that.

STEVE VIZARD:

Are there any circumstances, any circumstances, in which you’d consider onshore  processing?

JOE HOCKEY:

Not that I can see.

STEVE VIZARD:

I want to ask you Joe about Susie’s proposition that in some way she has failed  women in her Prime Minister role. Do you see it like that? Or do you see it as a  broader political issue?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, I would hope in Australia in the 21st century that we embraced as a nation a  female Governor General and a female Prime Minister and in my own state of New  South Wales a female Governor and a female Premier as you’ve had in Victoria a  female Premier. I mean, we’re over this male/female divide when it comes to quality  of leaders and we look at whether they are competent or not to do the job and the fact  is Julia Gillard is not up to the job of Prime Minister and Labor doesn’t know how to  govern. It’s not complicated and I don’t think it’s male or female. It’s a question of  whether someone is competent for the job and clearly she does not act and behave like  a Prime Minister.

SUSIE O’BRIEN:

But you can’t deny that there was a clear gender division in the polls.

JOE HOCKEY:

I think there was an advantage, I think there was an advantage in being the first  female Prime Minister. I think you know there were quite understandably a number of  women who rejoiced in a women becoming Prime Minister but I think that’s totally  irrelevant to her position in the poll today.

SUSIE O’BRIEN:

I think it’s easy for you to say that it’s irrelevant but it’s certainly the way that a lot of  people felt and I guess what I was trying to argue is that a lot of these people are now  feeling doubly let down because I think that they do feel, I mean as I said, some of the  bloggers from the Herald Sun website today are saying that this is now an experiment  that we now cannot afford to repeat. So she is being judged …

STEVE VIZARD:

I don’t think it’s a gender experiment, I think it’s an experiment in a minority  government that’s failed.

JOE HOCKEY:

That’s right. I don’t think it’s a gender experiment and I certainly hope it isn’t

STEVE VIZARD:

Can she recover from 24%? I mean that’s so dramatically low in terms of support.  Surely it’s irrecoverable Joe.

JOE HOCKEY:

Steve it’s like this. The Labor party in government has no values. It is an empty  cylinder. It is vacuous. It has no principles as reflected in the fact that they can’t  decide whether they want to be more right wing on border protection than the Liberal  party or whether they want to revert to the left wing instincts of the Greens. I mean  the left wing of the Labor party is soul less. It has no core principles. It has contracted  out principled policy decision making for the left to the Greens and now the right  wing of the Labor party is trying to beat a hairy chest to have a draconian process in  place for processing the applications of refugees with a people swap with Malaysia  which has been found by the High Court to be unlawful. They are a party without a  soul and that’s reflected in everything they have done from border protection through  to live cattle exports. It is basically a party that does not know how to govern and  they’re paying a very heavy price for it.

STEVE VIZARD:

I’ve got a very specific question for you Joe. The NSW Budget being delivered today,  it looks like Premier Barry O’Farrell up there is going to be hiking up state mining  royalties just like Colin Barnett did in Western Australia. It has been reported that  Tony Abbott has encouraged this. One of the consequences, whether he encouraged it  or not, it would wedge Julia Gillard on the carbon tax. What’s your view on state  governments using mining royalties and the impact on the wedging of the federal  government.

JOE HOCKEY:

The fact of the matter is here Steve that the royalties are a responsibility of the states.  They actually are the custodians of the land, not the Commonwealth government,  when it comes to minerals. So they do have a power in relation to royalties. They  already collect royalties. They have a right to increase the royalties and in so far as  they are doing it, it continues to undermine what is a flimsy deal between Wayne  Swan, Julia Gillard and three major miners in Australia. And the fact is, this is a mess  of Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard’s making. They were the ones that went to the last  election saying they were going to raise over $11 billion out of a mining tax and now  they are trying to deny the states to raise their own taxes, when in fact this  government in Canberra has made an art form of not only creating new taxes, but  raising taxes. So I have no sympathy at all for Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard on this.  They now have a budgetary mess on their hands and it’s all of their own making.

STEVE VIZARD:

Joe Hockey Shadow Treasurer, always good to talk to you.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks Steve, thanks Susie.
