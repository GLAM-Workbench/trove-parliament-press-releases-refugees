PRIME MINISTER

FOR MEDIA 23/6/83

The Commonwealth Government today offered to reimburse the  Queensland Government for all expenditure on agreed works on  the Burdekin Dam project in the current financial year up  to $6.5 million.

The payment will be made by way of a non-repayable grant.

The Commonwealth Government expects shortly to approach the  Queensland Government to begin negotiations for the future  funding of the project. :

I understand that to date this year the amount spent on the  Burdekin Dam has been approximately $4.8 million, including  consultants fees and a range of preliminary works associated  with the project.

The grant will cover those aspects of the project which the  Commonwealth, following discussions with Queensland, has already  indicated that it is prepared to reimburse.

I today asked the Queensland ;  Premier for an early reply to the  Commonwealth offer, to enable payments of financial assistance  to be made before the end of this financial year.

My dear Premier

I understand there has been previous correspondence   and discussions between the Commonwealth and   Queensland Governments concerning Commonwealth   financial assistance for the Burdekin Dam Project   but that no formal agreement has been reached yet.

The Commonwealth currently has this matter under   review.

In the meantime,  to enable a payment to be made to   Queensland before the end of the present financial   year,  the Commonwealth is prepared to agree with   your State in respect of financial assistance for   work on the Project for the financial year 1982/83.

I propose that the Commonwealth offers Queensland   a non-repayable and non-interest bearing grant of   an amount equal to the expenditure,  during this   period,  by your State on the Project. The grant is,

however, limited to $6.5 million and is only payable   in respect of expenditure on that part of the Project   which the Commonwealth,  in discussions and   correspondence between our respective representatives,   has indicated it is prepared to reimburse.  Further,   the payment of this financial assistance is, of   course,  subject to the conditions contained in the

National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act   1978, of the Commonwealth.

I v/ould appreciate your early response to this offer   so that, if there is agreement, payments of the   financial assistance may be made before the end of   this financial year. '  .

Yours sincerely

BOB HAWKE.

TRANSCRIPT: -  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, FOREIGN POLICY   ASSOC I AT I ON‘ LUNCH,?; PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK, 10 JUNE 1983

E AND 0 E -  PROOF ONLY

QUESTION: YOU MENTIONED THE ANZUS ALLIANCE. PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPAND A L IT T L E  B IT  ON FOREI GN POLICY IN THE SOUTHERN  P A C I F I C  REGION, THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOUR GOVERNMENT PERCEIVES  THE SOVIET THREAT AS BEING DIFFERENT FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AND  SECURITY MATTERS I N  THAT AREA?

PRIME M I N I S T E R :  THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I WILL ANSWER THAT VERY BROAD QUESTION AS BRIEFLY AS I POSSTBLY CAN. LET ME  SAY FOUNDATIONALLY I N  ANSWERING 1 HAT QUESTION THAT WE REGARD  THE R E LA TI O N S H IP , SECURITY AND DEFENCE RE LA TI O NS HI P , BETWEEN  OUR TWO COUNTRIES EMBODIED I N  THE ANZUS TREATY, AS I SAY,  FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR P O S I T I O N .  WE HAVE A SHARED PERCEPTION OF  THE GLOBAL SECURITY THREATS TO US AL L.  WE CO-OPERATE  EF FE CTIVELY AND CONTINUOUSLY WITH YOUR COUNTRY UNDER THE  AEGIS OF THE ANZUS TREATY. I F  YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE

PARTICULAR AREAS I N  OUR REGION OE IMMEDIATE CONCERN AND WITH  WHICH WE ARE CO-OPERATING WITH YOU, I GUESS THAT THE ONE WHICH  I S  MOST OBVIOUS AT THE MOMENT IS I N  I N D O -C H IN A .  AND MAY I

SAY IN RESPECT OF THAT ISSUE THAI WE SHARE THE VIEW  OF THE UNITED STATES, INDEED OF THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, AS  TO THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS IN  THAT TRAGIC COUNTRY KAMPUCHEA. AND THEY ARE, OF COURSE,

THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WITHDRAWAI OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS  FROM THAT COUNTRY AND A CREATION OF CONDITIONS WHERE THE PEOPLE  OF THAT COUNTRY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FREELY TO EXPRESS  THEIR WILL AS TO THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY DESIRE  TO HAVE. I WOULD SAY TO YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

2-

/

THAT WE B E L I E V E .  AND I T  HAS BECOMF CLEAR TO US SINCE WE'VE . %

COME INTO O F F I C E ,  THAT WE PERHAPS ARE I N  THE ALMOST UNIQUE PO SI TI O N TO PLAY A ROLE I N  ACCELERATING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF .

THOSE BASIC CONDITIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE A WARM, CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE F I V E  COUNTRIES THAT COMPRISE ASEAN. WE HAVE, AS YOU KNOW, A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA. OF COURSE, NO COUNTRY HAS A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WE BE LIEVE WITH THE UNITED STATES. AND WE DO HAVE A CAPACITY AS WELL TO TALK TO HA NOI . AND THEREFORE WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING P R E C IP IT A T E  I N  TERMS OF SOME SUGGESTED RESUMPTION OF A I D  TO VIETNAM WHICH WOULD DENIGRATE FROM OUR CAPACITY TO EXERCISE THAT UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND I ' M PLEASED TO SAY

TO YOU THAT AS RECENTLY AS LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT AGO, WHEN I WAS IN INDONESIA TALKING TO MOCHTAR, THE FOREIGN M I NI S TE R OF INDO NE SIA , THAT HE CONVEYED TO US THAT AFTER THE ASEAN MIN ISTERS MEETING WHICH I S  TAKING PLACE IN A FEU DAYS I N  BANGKOK, I T  IS

THEI R BE L IE F  THAT OUT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS THERE MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE OPENING UP OF P O S S I B I L I T I E S  OF FURTHER :

DISCUSSIONS WITH HANOI AND THAT 1 HEY MAY ASK OUR FOREIGN M I N I S T E R ,  MR HAYDEN, TO TAKE A MESSAGE FROM THE ASEAN COUNTRIES TO HANOI. WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY PLEASED THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY THAT ROLE. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A TOTAL SHARING OF PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE DANGERS THAT E X I S T , NOT MERELY FOR THE TRAGIC PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA, BUT THE DANGERS

THAT ARE INVOLVED I N  THAT TOTAL RELIANCE OF VIETNAM UPON THE  SOVIET U NI O N,  A RELIANCE WHICH WAS REFLECTED I N  AN INFLOW  TO VIETNAM FROM THE SOVIET UNION OF ASSISTANCE TO THE ORDER  OF ABOUT DOLLARS 3 M I L L I O N  A DAY. WE WITNESSED THE EXPANSION  OF THE F A C I L I T I E S  OF THE SOVIET UNION IN CAM RANH BAY WHICH  ARE NOT ONLY I N T R I N S I C A L L Y  DANGEROUS, BUT WHICH PROVIDE A

PLATFORM OF PROJECTION FOR THE SOVIET INTO AREAS OF  IMPORTANCE TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO OURS. AND SO I T S  IN OUR  INTERESTS, I T S  IN THE INTERESTS OR VIETNAM, IT S  IN THE

INTERESTS OF ASEAN COUNTRIES, I T S  IN THE INTERESTS OF THE  UNITED STATES THAT WE ALL CAN DO WHAT WE CAN THATS POSSIBLE  TO GET VIETMAN BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND TO BRING  AN END TO THAT ALMOST TOTAL RELIANCE THAT I T  HAS UPON THE  SOVIET UNION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PURSUE THAT PATH IN A  WAY WHICH PREJUDICES THE PERCEPTIONS OF INTERESTS OF THE  ASEAN COUNTRIES, THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA OR T H IS  GREAT COUNTRY. WE ARE COMMITTED. MR PRESIDENT, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN THEREFORE, TO TRY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE  OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE THE OPENING UP OF

THOSE DISCUSSIONS 50 THAT OUR SHARED OBJECTIVES AND  PERCEPTIONS IN THAT COUNTRY CAN HI ACHIEVED.

QUESTION: I F  WE COULD MOVE FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION TO DOMESTIC MATTERS. THERE CERTAINLY IS A DIFFERENCE OF VIEW AND  PERCEPTION ABOUT THE ROLE OF PERSONAL INCOME TAXES IN THE

\

. . . / 3

3-

VARIOUS ECONOMIES OF THE WORLD, "I HE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY  REPRESENT A D E - I N C E N T I V E . COULD YOU COMMENT ON YOUR VIEWS  ON THAT.

PRIME M I N I S T E R :  I GUESS WE ARE A I L  AT ONE IN SAYING THAT

WE'D L I K E  LESS OF THEM AND I HAD INDICATED I N  THE PREÂ­

ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT WE WOULD AI TEMPT TO MOVE TO SOME  REDUCTION IN INCOME TAXES. THAT I S  NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE. I  THINK THE OBJECTIVES THAT GOVERNMENT HAS TO HAVE IN MIND  WHEN I T  MAKES I T S  FISCAL DECISIONS ARE THESE: WHAT SORT OF ENVIRONMENT CAN YOU CREATE WHICH I S  MOST L I K E L Y  TO ENSURE

THAT THOSE FORCES WHICH CREATE A C T I V I T Y  AND CREATE JOBS ARE  GOING TO BEST BE ABLE TO FLOURISH. W I T H I N  THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES  AND I SPEAK NOW ABOUT MY COUNTRY, I ' M NOT COMING HERE TO T H I S  GREAT COUNTRY AND PRESUMING TO T H L  T H IS  ADMINIST RA TION  HOW

TO CONDUCT I T S  A F F A IR S ,  BUT RELATING TO MY OWN WE BELIEVE  THAT WE HAVE TO CONDUCT A FIS CAL  POLICY AND CREATE A FISCAL  STANCE WHICH IS LEAST LI KE LY  TO CREATE UNACCEPTABLE UPWARD  PRESSURES ON INTEREST RATES. I T  WOULD BE NICE TO CUT TAXES  AS I ' D  HOPED BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT WE COULD. BUT I F  I

WERE TO DO THAT WE WOULD BE VERY I IKELY TO CREATE A SI TU AT IO N  OF AN INCREASED BUDGET D E F I C I T  WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT I N  TERMS  OF THE COMBINED DEMANDS OF THE PUKLIC SECTOR BORROWING  REQUIREMENT, TOGETHER WITH THE HOPE FOR EXPANSION OF THE PRIVATE  SECTOR, THAT THERE WOULD BE INTOLERABLE INCREASES IN INTEREST  RATES. SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE CUTTING INCOME TAXES IN THE

IMMEDIATE FUTURE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT AFTER ALL PEOPLE'S  INTERESTS, WHAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, AS I F  THEY GET A  REDUCTION I N  INCOME TAXES THEY ARE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OEE I F  WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT

IN WHICH THERE ARE LOWER INTERESI RATES, IN WHICH THERE ARE  HIGHER LEVELS OF A C T I V I T Y  AND* IN WHICH THERE ARE MORE JOBS  FOR THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN. SO IN THAT CONTEXT, MR CHAIRMAN, I GIVE YOU THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT  OF A REDUCTION OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES IN OUR

COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAI TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO AVOID  THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE -  THAT I S  THE  CREATION OF AN ECONIMIC ENVIRONMENT W IT H IN  WHICH THE TOTAL  ECONOMIC CAKE IS MORE LI KE LY  TO BROW. WE RECOGNISE THAT THE

PRIVATE SECTOR, WHICH EMPLOYS 75 PER CENT OF OUR PEOPLE, HAS GOT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OE GOING TO THE CAPITAL  MARKETS AT RELATIVELY ACCEPTABLE INTEREST RATES TO BRING ABOUT  THAT COND ITIO N. SO PERHAPS I T S  NOT AN IMMEDIATELY HAPPY  MESSAGE FOR THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL INCOME TAX PAYERS IN  MY COUNTRY. BUT I CAN ASSURE THEM, AND T H I S  IS WHAT

P O L IT I C S  I S  ALTIMATELY ALL ABOUT, AND THAT I S  MAKING SURE THAI  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE, THAT YOU DON'T MAKE DECISIONS  IN TERMS OF IMMEDIATE PERCEPTIONS' OF S E L F - I N T E R E S T ,  BUT THAT YOU  GET THE LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF

. . , / 4

.... s r

WE ATTEMPT TO TAKE THAT LONGER Tf-KM PER SPECTI VE THEN I T  WOULD   BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO MOVE TO A REDUCTION OF INCOME TAX   RATES.  ONCE WE GET THE ECONOMY MOVI NG,  AS WE W I L L ,  THEN I   HOPE BEFORE THE END OF OUR F I R S T  TERM OF GOVERNMENT WE MAY   BE ABLE TO G I V E  SOME R E L I E F  I N  THAT RESPECT.

QUEST I ON:  ANOTHER AREA YOU D I D N ' T  COVER I N YOUR SPEECH -I M M I GR A T I ON  I N  AUSTRA LI A -  YOUR P A R T Y ’ S VIEW ON THE ROLE OF   I MMI GR A T I ON  AND DEVELOPMENT OF THt COUNTRY.

PRIME M I N I S T E R :  YOU' VE GOT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I N  TERMS OF I T  BEING MY PARTY I N  GOVERNMENT IN THE WAR AND POST-WAR   PERIOD WHICH I N I T I A T E D  THE GREATEST I M M I GR A T I ON  PROGRAM I N   RECORDED HUMAN H I S T O R Y .  WE WERE AT THE END OF THE WAR A

COUNTRY OF 7 M I L L I O N  PEOPLE,  NOW 15 M I L L I O N .  THAT HAS   TRANSFORMED US NOT ONLY I N  ABSOLUTE TERMS BUT I T  HAS CHANGED   THE DEMOGRAPHY AND THE ETHNI C COMPOSI TI ON OF OUR COUNTRY AND  HAS ENORMOUSLY ENRICHED US ECONOMICALLY AND CULTURALLY AND IN  SO MANY OTHER WAYS. THERE I S  AN ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD JUST  OPEN-ENDEDLY PURSUE HIGHER AND HIGHER IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT T H A T 'S  CORRECT. WE BELIEVE THAT WITH "  UNEMPLOYMENT IN O F F I C I A L  TERMS OF OVER 10 PER CENT I T  DOESN'T

MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A LARGE EXPANDSD IMMIGRATION PROGRAM. SO  WE HAVE SLIGHTLY CUT I T  BACK AT 1 HE MOMENT. THAT5 NOT GOING  TO HAVE S I G N I F I C A N T  IMPACT IN THF AREA OF OUR COMMITMENT TO  REFUGEES. YOU WOULD KNOW THAT NF XT TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY THERE

I S  NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHICH HAS TAKEN PROPORTIONATELY  A HIGHER NUMBER OF REFUGEES IN RF CENT YEARS. WE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY  GOING TO ADHERE TO THAT. BUT WE RELIEVE THAT WHAT WE'VE GOT  TO DO I S  TO GET OUR ECONOMY MOVING IN A WAY THAT WILL ENABLE  US WITH CONFIDENCE AND WITHOUT THF P O S S I B I L I T Y  OF A SOCIAL

CORROSION THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE  SEE MORE COMING TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS WIT HI N WHICH WE'LL  BE ABLE TO MOVE TO A MORE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN IMMIGRATION. AND LET ME, OF COURSE, MAKE THE POINT THAT OUR GOVERNMENT  REMAINS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THAT

IMMIGRATION SHOULD BE ON THE BASIS IRRESPECTIVE OF  COLOUR OR CREED, BUT IN TERMS OF 1 HE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO WISH  TO COME TO OUR COUNTRY AND OF THF ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS AND THE  LABOUR REQUIREMENTS OF AUSTRALIA.

ENDS.
