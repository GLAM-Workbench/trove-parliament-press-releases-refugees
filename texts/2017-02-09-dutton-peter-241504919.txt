DAVID LIPSON:

Peter Dutton thanks for your time.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks David.

DAVID LIPSON:

If you could start by taking us through these changes to the Migration Act?

PETER DUTTON:

Well we have for a long time tried to get more tourist numbers into Australia as you  would expect. We’re competing with markets like the US and the UK where they’ve  extended the visa period to 10 years and multiple entries are allowed into those  markets. Now, we’ve decided on a trial basis that we will try and compete against  those people with a 10 year visa in China and at the moment if somebody is granted  a visa we can make the checks and conduct the security and intelligence checks etc,  if that is applicable to a particular visa category and people can be issued the visa,  they can travel here.

Now, it is normally for a very limited period of time. By extending it to 10 years we  have somebody who can during the course of, you know, anytime during that 10  years travel here and a lot can change in that person’s life over those 10 years. So  once they’ve got possession of that lawful visa, over the 10 year period we want to  give ourselves the ability for details to be updated if people pose a threat or there are  character issues for example, we want to be able to stop that person from coming  into our country.

DAVID LIPSON:

But isn’t it the case that you’ll be able to target not just individuals, as you seem to be  talking about now, but entire groups of people based on where they were born, their  passports, where they’ve travelled?

PETER DUTTON:

No, no again David, let’s call this for what it is. This is a red herring, a political red  herring from the Labor Party. In fact they dropped their attack, they didn’t ask a  question in Question Time for this to be such a significant issue. They put out a  press release this afternoon….

DAVID LIPSON:

…leaving Labor aside, we can come back to them, but you know is that the case that  you will, as the Minister, be given broader powers to actually classify entire groups of  people that can get different treatment to other visa holders?

PETER DUTTON:

The proposal here is in relation to Chinese tourists coming into our country on a 10  year visa. This is the change in the Act which applies only to them.

Now, your point is could you prescribe another group for example a 10 year visitor  visa to India? Yes and that is disallowable by the Parliament. So if the Parliament  decides that we don’t want to grant that visa to India, well they can have the ability  through the Senate or through the House to disallow that.

Now, there is nothing extraordinary in that and again it is complete red herring and  distraction from Bill Shorten’s hiding in the Parliament yesterday and I think really  this is an issue of national security in terms of stopping people that might come to  our country who potentially could be a threat.

The vast majority are good people, law abiding, come here as tourists, they spend  money, they create jobs, that’s great. But where people pose a threat we should  have the ability under a 10 year visa to cancel it and we would do that under what we  are proposing in this law…

DAVID LIPSON:

…but you already have the power - sorry to interrupt - you already do have the  power to cancel individual visas though on character or emergency security grounds.  Why is that not enough?

PETER DUTTON:

And this power reflects that in relation to this particular visa category. So for  somebody who has been granted a visa, it is easy enough to deny somebody a visa  if there are pings that come back in the database checks on their criminal history or

you know running drugs or whatever their activity might be that we would deny a  visa. But once someone has possession of a valid visa, it is difficult in that  circumstance, particularly if people have it for a 10 year period and the beauty now is  that we can anchor people’s identity through biometrics and it allows us the ability to  have a longer run visa, but if during the period of say that 10 year period people pop  up on movement alert lists or they pop up with character issues etc, we have the  ability under this Bill to deal effectively with that. And as I say it is disallowable by the  Parliament in relation to the prescribing of that particular visa category and I think  that’s as it should be.

DAVID LIPSON:

An asylum seeker on Manus Island was forcibly removed overnight and sent home  as I understand it. Why was that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well that’s an issue for PNG. Under the arrangement that Kevin Rudd arrived at with  Prime Minister O’Neill at the time, people would be processed in PNG, if they were  found to be refugees then they could settle in PNG. That was the arrangement that  Labor signed and that we have in operation at the moment. And if people are found  not be refugees, then the obligation is for them to return back to their country of  origin and that’s as it should operate, it is as Labor signed up to and we’ve been very  clear that people on Manus and on Nauru won’t settle in Australia and we’ve been  very clear about that and it has been part of the success in now over 900 days of not  having a successful people smuggling venture.

DAVID LIPSON:

So there’s no Australian oversight of that processing decision?

PETER DUTTON:

Under the Labor agreement with Prime Minister O’Neill the arrangement was very  clear and that is that PNG as a signatory to the convention and to the protocols  would have a look at each individual case and if people were determined, as some  have, to be refugees they can settle in PNG. If they’ve been found not to be a  refugee then they need to return back to their country or origin. That would be I  presume on the media reports the activity that has been undertaken in PNG.

DAVID LIPSON:

What is the latest update on the agreement with the United States to resettle up to  1200 or so refugees in that country?

PETER DUTTON:

Well there is no update other than the fact that the US is working through the cases  that have been put to them now.

Again Labor, through their policy failing put people on to Nauru and Manus, our job is  to get them off and to do it in a way that doesn’t restart boats. We’ve been  successful in doing that so far, but the intelligence is very clear, the people  smugglers are trying to put people onto boats now. We are disrupting ventures in  home ports and we have an increased presence both at sea and in the air with our  Navel and Border Force assets.

So there is a lot of work that is going on behind the scenes to continue the success  and I hope that we can get people to the US sooner than later because like  everybody I want people off Nauru and Manus, but I don’t want new boat arrivals  filling the vacancies that are created.

DAVID LIPSON:

You’ve always been confident that this deal with hold despite the public  pronouncements on Twitter and the like from Donald Trump. He seems to have  moderated his tweets since those earlier ones and the leaks of that conversation  with the Prime Minister. Does that give you any more confidence or were you always  confident that this….

PETER DUTTON:

…well David I was confident that the US would honour the deal, they’ve done that.  We’re appreciative to both President Obama and now to President Trump. It is  obviously a very broad deep relationship that we have with the United States. It has  been long and enduring and long may that be the case. So we will continue to work  with the US and as I say, at an officials level, they’re working through the detail now  and I’m going to allow them to do that without running some ongoing public  commentary on the arrangement.

DAVID LIPSON:

Just on the goings on in Parliament over the past 24 hours, we saw Malcolm  Turnbull in full flight against the Opposition Leader, a very personal attack. Is that the  sort of thing that you want to see the Prime Minister doing more of?

PETER DUTTON:

I think if you’re standing to be Prime Minister in this country, you need to accept that  people will scrutinise your personality and your background and Mr Shorten has  questions to answer.

I think people, as we are seeing in the polls, people have hesitations around Mr  Shorten, they have a niggling suspicion that he’s not who he says he is. He’s been  involved in union agreements that have taken rights away from workers, but seen  money end up in the union pocket. We’ve seen situations of his own colleagues  being betrayed by him and I think it is perfectly reasonable that the Prime Minister  would highlight the duplicitous nature of Mr Shorten because Australians should  understand that. If he wants to be Prime Minister of this country then Labor is going  to have to accept that there will be greater scrutiny and our intention is to apply

greater scrutiny to Bill Shorten because given his union background, given the fact  that he’s now propped up by the CFMEU, this is a very considerable background that  he has and people rightly should ask questions about it.

DAVID LIPSON:

So we can expect that blow torch to be applied a bit more often?

PETER DUTTON:

I hope so because Parliament is a place of scrutiny and people need to answer  questions and Mr Shorten has a dark past and we need to learn more about it.

DAVID LIPSON:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton we’ll have to leave it there, thanks for your time.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks David.
