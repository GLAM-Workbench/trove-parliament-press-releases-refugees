New Christmas Island detainees cannot be left ‘out of sight, out of  mind’

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has called on Immigration Minister Chris  Evans to ensure that a new group of suspected asylum seekers have any claims  processed in a timely manner, and are treated humanely in line with the  Government’s new immigration policies.

Twelve people who are thought to be asylum seekers were rescued from a sinking  boat off northern Western Australia yesterday, and are being taken to Christmas  Island.

“These people should be brought to mainland Australia for prompt processing of any  claims for asylum,” said Senator Hanson-Young.

“Offshore processing of claims propagates an out of sight, out of mind attitude  towards asylum seekers, who deserve timely attention from officials and community  support.

“Testament to this approach is the fact that we have heard little about the progress of  the last two groups of people to be taken to the Christmas Island detention facility.”

Senator Hanson-Young said that legislative change was needed to adequately  protect the human rights of asylum seekers.

“The Minister’s good intentions alone are not adequate to protect human rights and  justice,” she said.

“The Greens hope to see immigration legislation amended in the new year.

“In the meantime, we will be keeping a close eye on the welfare and progress of all  detainees being held on Christmas Island.”
