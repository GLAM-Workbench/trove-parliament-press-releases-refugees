KEVIN RUDD’S LONG WEEKEND OF BOATS

Sunday, 11 April 2010

People smugglers have sent Kevin Rudd a clear message this weekend, with four  boat arrivals in less than 48 hours, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

“The arrival of Boat 110 is the ninth boat to arrive this month. What is more  concerning is that these nine boats have arrived in the space of just eight days,”  Mr Morrison said.



“The only people sending a message about people smuggling under Kevin Rudd’s  policies are the people smugglers themselves,” he said.

“Kevin Rudd’s tough talk of last Friday has failed to have an impact for even a  weekend, with the arrival of four boats within 48 hours.

“The announcement has also led to criticism from across the spectrum about the  veracity of the new suspension policy and the potential for legal challenges.

“This announcement was clearly made on the run, in order to stop headlines  rather than stop the boats.

“Not only will we now have to continue to deal with the ongoing arrival of boats  as a result of Kevin Rudd’s announcement, but also the further consequences of  failed policy.

“Under Kevin Rudd we just keeping going from bad to worse. The more he  touches the worse it gets,” Mr Morrison said.

Mr Keenan said: “The people smugglers are mocking Kevin Rudd, responding to  the Government's policy on the run by sending four boats to Australia in one  weekend.

“People smugglers continue to be in charge of who comes to Australia.

“Boats are coming in greater numbers and getting closer and closer to Australia  whilst remaining undetected, as the flood of illegal arrivals continues unabated,”  he said.
