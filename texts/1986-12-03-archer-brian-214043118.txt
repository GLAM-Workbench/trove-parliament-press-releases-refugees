A STATEMENT FROM THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR SCIENCE

CSIRO REPUTATION UNDERMINED BY WRAN APPOINTMENT

Neville Wran's appointment as Chairman of the new CSIRO  Board, which was officially announced today, will undermine  the outstanding reputation that the CSIRO holds in the

Australian community and overseas, the Shadow Minister for  Science, Senator Brian Archer, said today.

The excellent record of the CSIRO in world standard

scientific research will in no way be enhanced by such a

cynical and inappropriate political appointment.

The contribution of the CSIRO to the important

revitalisation of Australian industry will be weakened by  the Wran appointment.

According to the Chairman of the NSW Science and Technology  Council Professor Michael Birt, the Wran Government's record  in promotion of research and development was abysmal and  placed the 'future viability of the science and technology

base in NSW at risk1.

What confidence will Australian industry now hold in the  CSIRO with a political refugee at the helm.

Encouraging moves by industry to co-operate more closely  with CSIRO will be set back, and morale within the

organisation itself will slump even further, at a time when  the major expectation of the restructured Board was bold  leadership from a top Australian scholar, scientist or  industrialist.

The Government's justifications for the appointment are  singularly unconvincing. There is no excuse for the

politicisation of an organisation with a proud record of  vigorous scientific research free from political

interference.

Australian scientists and industry leaders can feel very  disappointed.
