TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BY MATTHEW ABRAHAM ON 2CN  (ABC) WITH THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  SENATOR ROBERT HILL, AT 8.50AM ON 1.11.91

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: (WILL YOU BE SECONDING) SENATOR EVANS FOR TH E NOBEL PRIZE?

ROBERT HILL: WELL, I CERTAINLY H O PE  THAT PEACE IS ACHIEVED. I TH IN K  IT'S  SOMETHING TO BE PLEASED ABOUT THAT AT LEAST IT'S REACHED THE  STAGE OF AN AGREEMENT. BUT THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO. APART

FROM ANYTHING ELSE TH IS AGREEMENT, AS YOU KNOW, LEGITIM ISES  TH E ROLE OF THE KHMER ROUGE WHO JU ST  OVER TEN  YEARS AGO  MURDERED A MILLION O F T H E  CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. SO IT REALLY IS  AN ASTONISHING STATE O F AFFAIRS. BUT IF IT WILL WORK, IF, IN FACT,

THE KHMER ROUGE HAVE BECOME DEMOCRATS AND ARE PREPARED TO  GIVE U P 70% OF TH EIR ARMS - WHICH IS THE FORMULA - AND WILL  PARTICIPATE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, TH EN  IT'S GOT A CHANCE OF  WORKING.

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: YOU SOUND DOUBTFUL ABOUT THE KHMER ROUGE'S INTEN TIO NS IN  THE PEACE PROCESS AND ALSO POL POT'S INTENTIONS.

SENATOR HILL: WELL, POL POT HASN'T EVEN BEEN EXCLUDED. W E'RE ALWAYS  PROMISED THAT PART OF TH IS FORMULA WOULD BE TH E EXCLUSION OF

POL PO T AND THAT HASN'T COME TO PASS. HE'S STILL ACTIVELY  BEHIND THE KHMER ROUGE AND . . . WELL, YOUVE GOT TO BE A BIT  SCEPTICAL. I PU T IT TO T H E  UNITED NATIONS LAST W EEK W HEN I WAS  IN NEW  YORK: HOW CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT TH E KHMER ROUGE

(WE DON'T KNOW THE SIZE O F THEIR FORCE OR T H E  EXTENT OF THEIR  ARMAMENTS) ARE GOING TO VOLUNTARILY GIVE U P 70% OF THOSE  WEAPONS AND 70% OF T H E IR  FORCE IS GOING TO RETURN TO THE  VILLAGES AS FARMERS, I SUPPOSE. SO HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS

GOING TO OCCUR? TH E ANSWER AT T H E  UN WAS THAT WE HAD TO  RELY ON THEIR GOOD FAITH. WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD OF  TH E  KHMER ROUGE IN TH E  PAST THE PEACE AGREEM ENT THAT RELIES  ON TH EIR GOOD FAITH IS NO T ONE THAT GIVES ENORMOUS HO PE. BUT  NEVERTHELESS, TH ERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF GOOD WILL AMONG

COMMONWEALTH  PARLIAMENTARY L IB R A R Y   MICAH

THE PARTIES WHO MET IN PARIS AND WHO SIG NED THIS AGREEMENT.  IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY D IFFICU LT TASK. PERHAPS UP  TO 20,000 INTERNATIONAL FORCES ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED; A  PROJECT OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN, PERHAPS, $2-$5 BILLION OVER THE  NEXT FEW  YEARS. BUT, IF IT WORKS THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: YES, ONE WONDERS W HETHER YOU COULD HAVE STITCHED ANY SORT  OF PEACE AGREEMENT, NO MATTER HOW TENUOUS, W ITHOUT TH E

KHMER ROUGE.

SENATOR HILL: WELL, THIS, OF COURSE, IS GARETH EVANS'S ARGUMENT. HE SAYS THAT  AN AGREEMENT THAT LOCKS IN THE KHM ER ROUGE HAS TO BE BETTER

THAN ONE THAT EXCLUDES THEM. AND THAT ARGUMENT, IN THEORY,  I THINK IS QUITE SOUND. BUT TH E  DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE

AGREEMENT DOESN'T REALLY LOCK IN T H E  KHM ER ROUGE BECAUSE,  AS I SAID, IT RELIES UPON THEIR GOOD FAITH. AND EVEN SINCE THE  AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED WE'VE SEEN THEM  SEEKING TO FORCE THEIR  PEOPLE OUT OF THE REFUGEE CAMPS ON T H E  THAI BORDER AND

RETURN THEM TO WHERE THEY WISH TH EM  TO BE IN TH E COUNTRY.  AND AS A MATTER OF INTEREST, FIG H TIN G  IS STILL CONTINUING  WITHIN CAMBODIA AND IT'S THEREFORE A VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE  THAT LIES AHEAD. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN  CHANGES. I THINK THAT

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS T H E  GROWING RELATIONSHIP  BETW EEN CHINA AND VIETNAM WHICH, O F COURSE, WAS ALWAYS ONE  MAJOR OBSTACLE TO PEACE IN CAMBODIA. AND ALSO THERE DOES  SEEM TO BE A CHANGED ATTITUDE BETW EEN T H E  KHMER FACTIONS  THEMSELVES AND THAT IS CRITICAL - ALWAYS WAS THE MOST CRITICAL  ASPECT - TOWARDS ACHIEVING A PEACE. SO W E CAN HOPE, AND I

CERTAINLY THINK AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE SU PPO RTIN G  TH E PROCESS.  THESE PEO PLE HAVE HAD A WRETCHED PER IO D  O F TIME STRETCHING  BACK NOW, WHAT, FOR 20 YEARS, AND THEY DESERVE PEACE.

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: THEY SURE DO. ANOTHER AREA, OF COURSE, W HICH DESERVES PEACE  IS THE MIDDLE EAST. AND THE PEACE TALKS TH IS MORNING, THE  INITIAL POSTURING WE'RE HEARING, IS N O T H O PEFU L. WHAT'S YOUR

READING OF THAT? DO YOU THINK THAT ALL T H E  PARTIES HAVE TO GO  THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF REALLY PO STURIN G AND THAT THEY THEN  MAY BE ABLE TO GET DOWN AND HAMMER OUT SOME SORT OF  AGREEMENT?

SENATOR HILL: WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN ANYTHING UNEXPECTED SO FAR.  AND, AS YOU SAY, THE POSTURING REALLY HAD TO OCCUR AS PART OF  TH E  FIRST PHASE. THE IMPORTANT PHASE IS T H E  SECOND, WHICH IS

TH E BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS BETW EEN ISRAEL ON T H E  ONE HAND,  TH E LEBANON ON THE OTHER HAND, FIRSTLY. SECONDLY, THIS JO INT

JORDAN/PALESTINIAN DELEGATION, AND THIRDLY, SYRIA. AND I THINK  IF WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE A TASK THAT WOULD RAPIDLY BRING  PEACE THEN WE WOULD BE NAIVE. IN FACT, SOME LEARNED MIDDLE  EAST EXPERTS HAVE SAID TO ME THAT THEY ANTICIPATE THAT THE  PROCESS MAY TAKE SOME YEARS. AND IT WILL BE AN ON AND OFF  PROCESS. BUT AT LEAST TH ERE IS A M AJOR FIRST STEP BEING TAKEN.  AT LEAST THESE PEOPLE ARE AT THE TABLE AND THEYRE GOING TO

MOVE, WE BELIEVE, TO THIS BILATERAL NEGOTIATING PHASE.

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: WELL, JU ST  QUICKLY, THE CHANCE - AND TH IS IS AGAIN WAY DOWN THE  TRACK - BUT OF AUSTRALIAN TROOPS SERVING NOT JU ST IN CAMBODIA  BUT PERHAPS ON THE GAZA STRIP, TH E  W EST BANK AS PART O F A UN  FORCE?

SENATOR HILL: W ELL, AUSTRALIAN PEACE-KEEPING FORCES HAVE SERVED IN  PRACTICALLY EVERY UN FORCE IN TH E  MIDDLE EAST, AND NOT ONLY  UN FORCES. I VISITED THE AUSTRALIAN TROOPS WHO SERVED IN THE  M ULTI NATIONAL OBSERVER FORCE ON T H E  SINAI, WHICH WAS H ELPING

HOLD TH E PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND EGYPT. SO OUR RECORD HAS  B EEN  TO CONTRIBUTE IN T H ESE FORCES AND ITS BEEN A FIN E RECORD,  ACTUALLY.

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: ALL RIGHT . . .

SENATOR HILL: WE G ET TO START WONDERING ABOUT TH E  BOTTOM LINE OF ALL THIS  BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO CONTRIBUTING MILITARY PEO PLE TO TH E  W ESTERN SAHARA AT TH E MOMENT; T H E R E  WILL BE A BIG FO RCE IN  CAMBODIA, AND THE UN, O F COURSE, IS NOW INVOLVED IN AN

UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF PEACE-KEEPING FORCES AND THEY ALL  COST A LOT OF MONEY.

MATTHEW ABRAHAM: IT K EEPS US BUSY. SENATOR ROBERT HILL, THANK YOU.

SENATOR HILL: THANK YOU, MATTHEW.
