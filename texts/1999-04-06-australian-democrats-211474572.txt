Australian Government must assist with refugee 
places for Kosovo crisis

Â

The Democrat spokesperson for immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett 
has  urged the Government to immediately offer a significant number 
of refugee places for those affected by the current crisis in Yugoslavia.

Â

Senator Bartlett strongly criticised the Government’s 
refusal to increase the number of places for refugees to assist with 
the current tragedy in Kosovo, describing it as ‘heartless’.

Â

“The government’s refusal to help with refugees 
is inexcusable from a so-called civilised country”, Senator Bartlett 
said.

Â

“The Australian government has supported the US-NATO 
bombing. Therefore we have a moral obligation as a nation to assist 
with the refugee crisis which is a consequence of that bombing.

Â

“We have to live up to our responsibilities.

Â

“Mr Ruddock shouldn’t hide behind excuses about 
problems with temporary refuge. Temporary refuge is a Hansonite solution. 
Australia shouldn’t be offering temporary refuge, we should be offering 
permanent resettlement for refugees who are obviously in genuine and 
urgent need.

Â

“If this wasn’t such a serious and urgent issue, 
Mr Ruddock’s excuse that Australia is too far away to take refugees 
would be laughable.”

Â

Senator Bartlett also encouraged Mr Ruddock to ‘fast-track’ 
visas for those affected by the Yugoslavian conflict who are already 
in Australia.

Â

“The Minister has said the Department will consider 
their cases, case by case, but the Democrats urge the Minister to offer 
blanket protection for all who apply,” said Senator Bartlett.
