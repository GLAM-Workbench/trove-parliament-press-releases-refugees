REITH URGES ILO CHIEF TO SUPPORT FREEDOM FOR 
AUSTRALIAN CARE WORKERS IN YUGOSLAVIA

Â

The Austr alian Government has today (8th June 1999) taken up 
the cause of the two Australian CARE International workers imprisoned 
in Yugoslavia, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, with the Director General 
of the International Labour Organisation, Dr Juan Somavia.

Â

Mr Reith met with Dr Somavia this morning. Dr Somavia 
is the ILO’s most high ranking official. The circumstances of Mr Pratt 
and Mr Wallace were raised directly by Mr Reith. It was pointed out 
that the imprisonment of these workers was not merely a denial of human 
rights, but also a serious issue of interference with their rights as 
Australian nationals and employees of an Australian division of a respected 
international humanitarian organisation.

Â

Dr Somavia expressed concerns about the matter. He 
said he would ask the ILO Secretariat to provide appropriate assistance 
and indicated that taking up causes such as this was compatible with 
his role. Dr Somavia will receive further briefing from the Australian 
mission in Geneva.

Â

Support from the ILO adds to the already weighty cause 
from the international community for their release, including from the 
United Nations Secretary General, the United Nations High Commission 
for Refugees, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights and 
other leading international figures.
