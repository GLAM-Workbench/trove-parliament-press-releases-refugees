MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Amanda Vanstone on her appointment as Minister for Family and Community Services and her appointment to the Cabinet.

I would like to thank her for her tireless efforts working with me to administer the portfolio of Attorney-General, Justice and Customs.

I would also like to welcome my fellow West Australian colleague, Senator Chris Ellison, to his appointment as Minister for Justice and Customs. I look forward to working closely with him in this important and challenging portfolio.
