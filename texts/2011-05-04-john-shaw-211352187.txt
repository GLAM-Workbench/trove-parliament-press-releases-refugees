4 May 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH JOHN SHAW,  RADIO 2NZ, INVERELL

Subjects: Budget; Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; border protection.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

JOHN SHAW:

Good morning, Tony. How are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good, John.

JOHN SHAW:

That’s the way. The forthcoming budget, just a week away. What do you believe the budget should contain  and what should be the priorities the Government should come up with?

TONY ABBOTT:

John look, I’m making a speech, as you said, today in Melbourne on this very subject but essentially there  are four tests the budget has got to pass. First, does the budget show evidence that the Government can  actually keep spending under control? Second, do they have a plan to repay the debt as well as to get back  into surplus? Third, are they honest and upfront about the costs of their policy disasters like pink batts and  the border protection blowouts and, fourth, and very, very importantly the two big initiatives of this  Government, the NBN and the carbon tax must be detailed in this budget, particularly the carbon tax. The  carbon tax is the biggest financial change since the GST. It’s supposed to be introduced in just fourteen  months time. It will raise well in excess of $11 billion a year and that’s just to start and on current  indications the Government isn’t going to put it in the budget. Well, if that’s the case, the budget won’t be  worth the paper that it’s written on.

JOHN SHAW:

The foreign debt is approaching $200 billion. How do they rein that in?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s what they need to tell us. Now, the first thing you’ve got to do is to get government spending  under control and that basically means ending wasteful government spending and the problem is we’ve had  so many examples of wasteful government spending. I was out in Santa Teresa, an Aboriginal community  80 kilometres from Alice Springs last week and I had a look at a house that had allegedly been refurbished  under the strategic housing programme. You know, they had pulled up floor tiles, hadn’t replaced them,  hadn’t even cleaned the glue off the concrete floor. They hadn’t fixed cracks in this house, they’d just  screwed a plate over the crack in the concrete blocks. They had boarded up windows to put in air-conditioners, they’d taken ceiling fans off and replaced them with less effective wall fans. Now, I don’t  know how much money this renovation cost but it was money just completely wasted because the  renovation had left the house in worse condition than it was before.

JOHN SHAW:

You’ve travelled around Australia extensively over the last four or five weeks, including the charity bike  ride through this part of the world. You’ve been to mining areas in Western Australia, you’ve been to steel  mills in South Australia, southern New South Wales around Port Kembla, what’s the main topic of  discussion with people when they come up to you?

TONY ABBOTT:

John, the main topic of discussion is the carbon tax. Now, I think people are increasingly dismayed by this  tax, not just because it’s going to hit their cost of living but because it threatens their jobs and I want  Australia to be a manufacturing country, I don’t want us just to be a farm and a mine, important though  farming and mining are. We’ve got to remember of course that eventually the carbon tax is going to hit those  sectors as well, but in the short term it’s going to make steel making, aluminium making, cement making  and car marking almost prohibitively uncompetitive in this country and I just hope the Prime Minister is  listening. I mean, I think the people are speaking increasingly clearly on this. It seems that the Australians  are against the carbon tax by a margin of two to one. Please Prime Minister, listen to the Australian people  on this subject.

JOHN SHAW:

It would be a big backflip though, wouldn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah but a prime minister who doesn’t listen to the people on something like this, particularly when the  arguments are on the people’s side - I mean, what persuasive arguments can the Prime Minister put up for  this. I mean, it’s not as if Australia is belatedly following the rest of the world in introducing a broad based  goods and services tax as we were with the GST. In this case, we are going right out on a limb with a tax  which will be heavy, has not been done in this form anywhere else in the world and which will put us at a  terrible competitive disadvantage. So I think that when there’s no good argument for something, when the  public are dead against it, a sensible government listens.

JOHN SHAW:

Even Queensland Premier Anna Bligh has come out and said she can understand why people are uneasy and  nervous about the proposed carbon tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right and she doesn’t support it either at this stage. Now, I can understand Anna Bligh not  supporting it at this stage because the other day when the Treasurer scoffed, I think really poorly scoffed at  the impact of the carbon tax on steelmaking the head of BlueScope came straight out and said ‘look, he just  doesn’t understand what he’s talking about’. So if the Prime Minister can’t explain it and the Treasurer  doesn’t understand it why should the Labor Premier of Queensland support it, and if she doesn’t support it  why should the public support it?

JOHN SHAW:

Has there been much discussion with you about the riots last week at Villawood with the asylum seekers?  Has that been brought to your attention? Has it been mentioned much to you in discussions?

TONY ABBOTT:

John look, there’s a lot of talk about border protection and the fact that the Government has lost control of  our borders, the fact that it’s losing control of the detention centres. I think the public regard the  Government’s performance here as embarrassingly weak and I think the public understand that we’re being  taken for mugs by boat people and the people smugglers. Now, you know, I’m full of sympathy for someone  who wants to build a better life but you’ve got to do it the right way, not the wrong way, and paying a  people smuggler to come to Australia illegally and then breaking the law once you get here, I mean that’s  just completely unacceptable.

JOHN SHAW:

The killing of Osama bin Laden in the last 48 hours certainly has been featured around the world. You  know, these people are coming in on these boats. We’ve got no idea who they are or where they are from.

TONY ABBOTT:

And there are some concerns that the security checks which ASIO is supposed to do on all of these illegal  boat arrivals are now being skimped upon in order to get people out of detention centres more quickly and  relieve the Government’s overcrowding problem. So it’s so important, John, that we stop the boats because  once people get here there are all sorts of problems in the wake of their arrival and the Government plainly  has no answers. Jose Ramos Horta, the other day, the leader of East Timor, finally and fully kiboshed the  Government’s so-called East Timor plan. So really the Government is utterly clueless when it comes to  border protection.

JOHN SHAW:

Your thoughts on the possibility of Barnaby Joyce running for the federal seat of New England?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, let’s just wait and see. The federal election is possibly two and half years away and I just  wouldn’t want to speculate beyond saying that Barnaby is a terrific member of parliament. He really is an  outstanding contributor. I have a lot of regard for Barnaby as a politician and as a man and as a friend, and  wherever he is running, whoever he is representing he will do a terrific job.

JOHN SHAW:

Alright. Thanks Tony.
