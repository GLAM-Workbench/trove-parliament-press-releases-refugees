MEDEVAC REPEAL: THE VOTE THAT SHAMES THE NATION



Parliament has sunk to a new low with the shameful and inhumane repeal of the Medevac  legislation.

The people marooned on Manus Island and Nauru are Australia’s responsibility and it is a  basic human right that every person has access to appropriate medical care.  What have we  come to as a nation when we are prepared to treat human beings so cruelly?

Clearly Medevac has not started the boats again and has not created a national security  problem. The Government is hiding behind the term ‘national security’ because they know  there is no legitimate reason to have repealed the legislation. They are simply intent on  punishing innocent people in the name of ideology.

Medevac has reduced the preventable suffering of ill asylum seekers and refugees and is  supported by medical experts.  There are many politicians who should be ashamed of their  willingness to throw innocent people to the wolves.
