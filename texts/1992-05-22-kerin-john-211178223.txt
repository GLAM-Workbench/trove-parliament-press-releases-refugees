Australian assistance for Irian Jayan refugees

Australia is to provide further assistance to Irian JaYS. border crossers living in  Papua New Guinea, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John  Kerin, announced today.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will receive an  extra $500,000 in Australian funding to go towards its program on the PNG  border.

Mr Kerin said there were now about 6,400 Irian Jaya border crossers in PNG who  needed help.

"These people are living in difficult and isolated conditions. The main access to  the official UNHCR East Awin Camp is a bush track through mountainous  terrain," Mr Kerin said.

"To survive these conditions they require medical assistance and extensive  support in the form of food, shelter and clothing," he said.

Around 3,400 of the border crossers live in the East A win camp. The remaining  3,000 live in various unofficial border camps which receive no assistance from  the UNHCR but are given some support from local non-government  organisations.

Mr Kerin said the Australian assistance would be in the form of a $350,000 cash  grant, to the UNHCR and the provision of 255 tonnes of Australian rice valued at  $150,000.

Since 1984 Australia has contributed $7.7m to the UNHCR PNG/Irian Jaya border  crossers program. This includes the latest $500,000 grant.

The assistance is provided through emergency relief funds administered by  Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB.
