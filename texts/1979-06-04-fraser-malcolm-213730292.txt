PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 4 JUNE 1979

PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED: RADIO (SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE) STATION 2EA, SYDNEY

iL

Question

I'm sure you realise it is an honour for the Special Broadcasting  Service to have the Prime Minister of Australia to interview  and of course it is a great pleasure for me personally.

No doubt the world is going through a period of hardship and  economic crisis. Each country more and more comes to the point of  view that something more is needed - a vision, a philosophy. A country without an ideal is surely stranded. President Roosevelt

gave the Americans a New Deal in the Twenties to take them out  of their crisis. Kennedy ushered in the New Frontier. What  does today's Australia have?

Prime Minister I

I think Australia is looking forward to the 1980's now, with a  very great deal of confidence. We went through a period where  people felt that Governments could do everything; that you only  had to ask and Government could provide.  I think we now know that

that is not really true, because what we have in Australia is  what we all - you and I and everyone else - makes of it. Therefore,  it is a question of defining what Governments ought to do and  what people ought to do for themselves. Quite clearly, for those  who are disadvantaged, in special need, Governments have a

responsibility, but communities often do too. I think in Australia  we have, in a sense, a working out of what Government .  can do,  must do, and then what the community ought to do, what  individuals ought to expect to do for themselves. I think this

lies behind, in my view, a vision of Australia where people are  independent; they go their own way; where we are building a  different and a better society,as a result of the great  migration of the post-war era. Australia can never return to  the sort of country it was in the 1930's. I don't think we would  want it to, because then it maybe a somewhat narrow, somewhat  insular, Anglo-Saxon society. Now we are certainly not that. Our culture,has been enormously broadened. Our material  well-being has been greatly strengthened by tens, indeed hundreds .   of thousands, of people who have come to us from Greece and from  Italy and nearly every country around the world. I think the  vision for Australia is a determination by all of us to make  this a good country, a better country to bring up a family, but  to make it above all an example to the world of what a free  people can achieve.

Australia suffers from the tyranny of the distance. Isolation  is a major handicap in everything, from importing new ideas  to exporting Australia, whether it is ideas or products.  Shouldn't the Government regard air transport as a community  service that should be subsidised in some way?

Prime Minister

I don't really think so. We are, of course negotiating, and  have been very successfully, to get cheap air fares especially  in the off-peak periods between Australia and a number of ports  overseas. I think this is especially important, again, for  a number of new settlers who have their friends and relatives

in countries in Europe. I'm glad to see that the cheap air  fare policy is becoming widely accepted. It is certainly  attracting a great number of adherents - tens of thousands of  people are buying their tickets and I think it will do a very  great deal to enable family reunions to take place and for people  to meet their old friends. This is really bringing international  travel within;the reach of all Australians but it is doing it in  a way that is still commercial.  It's giving us the advantages  of cheap air fares but doing it in a way that isn't subsidised.  When you say 'shouldn't the Government do something about this1 I ,

you are not really asking the Government to do it, they asking  us to take some funds from all taxpayers to get them to do it,  because if we say we are going to fund something we have to take  the funds from your taxes and everyone else's taxes. I think we  need to use greater discretion in the way Governments spend

taxpayer's dollars than sometimes we have in the past.

Question

The same effects of distance and isolation apply internally  as well.

Prime Minister

Oh yes, they do.

Question

Fares and costs are going up and isolating Australians from  each other and now it's cheaper to fly excursion from Sydney to  London than to Perth.

Prime Minister

I don't know about the excursion rates, but that wouldn't apply  for other rates. I took out some comparisons of fares across  the United States the other day, and say, from London to Moscow,  and the internal fares have all been much higher - not just in  Australia also in other places - than the international fares.

Part of this is the responsibility on domestic airlines to  service country towns, small centres, places where you don't  get much traffic but where the service is terribly important. I think to an extent therefore, that the airlines probably  equalise out—  the general charges:— but they do recognise a very  real responsibility not just to service Melbourne and Sydney  and Sydney and Perth, but also to service the country areas.

I think your question recognises the importance of that. It is  expensive, but on the other hand I think people are now travelling  around Australia more than they ever have. Only this morning  I had 30 children to breakfast at the Lodge and they came from

Ingham, from Townsville, from Perth and Darwin, from Alice Springs,

.. ./3

2EA 3

Prime Minister (continued)

Tasmania, Sydney, Kirribilli, they came from all over. 20 years ago I don't think anyone —  this was something as  part of the International Year of the Child —  but 20 years  ago people would, have just said 'it's too difficult, travel

takes too much time, air transport is too unreliable' and  it wouldn't have happened. Now people are moving around, I think much much more than they ever have, and I think it is  a good thing that they do.

Question

The recent mini-budget abolished the 40 percent Commonwealth  subsidy for medical charges and increased hospital charges. Do you agree with the general opinion that the new system  inevitably hits people on the lower income scales particularly  migrants?

Prime Minister .

No, I don't think so, not at all, because the average hospital  charge in State hospitals now is about $150 a day and the charge  is going to be much less than that. It's - in many cases won't  be over half the actual cost, again, to the taxpayer. .  It's a  question therefore how much of the health charge should come out  of your own pocket or from insurance and how much should come

from taxpayer's funds generally. Now, it ought to be noted I think  that pensioners are protected through bulk-billing arrangements  and disadvantaged people are also protected through bulk-billing  arrangements that have been specially made with the medical  profession. If it wasn't for those two protections I would have  agreed with you that lower income people would be hit, but those

two things protect lower income people. As for the rest, we've  basically said in relation to the taking 40 percent off, people  can pay the smaller bills themselves or insure. It's their  choice, your choice and mine, but for the large bills, the  calamatous bills that could destroy the financial capacity of

a person or of a family, there is the complete protection there  - for each procedure - no charge will be more than “$20 because  anything above that, whether it $1,000 or whatever, the Government  will pay. One of the things - I think it is around about

70 percent of everyone is insured in one sense. I would like -  once before in earlier times the percentage insured was over  90 percent. I hope that what we've done will encourage more  people to insure because I think when you do this it helps people

to be aware of what the cost of services are and in some parts  of the medical profession — in pathology and hospital - not in  the treatment given patients so much but in the way the hospitals  are run - there has been enormous extravagance and waste. There  are many hospitals in Australia that have only got a 60 percent or

70 percent bed occupancy but they are manned for 100 percent. Again, we've got to make sure that everyone has the best health  care which we can devise but I think we've also got a responsibility  to do it in a way which protects the revenue and which is

economical. People also want lower taxes. I've heard a bit about  that over the last few days. We certainly aren't going to

.. . /4

2EA

be able to meet that sort of wish for lower taxes unless  the Government funds we spend, whether it is on education or  hospitals, is spent efficiently and economically. I think that  is what we are after.

Question

Prime Minister (continued)

It has been repeatedly claimed that the present method of  selecting migrants stresses three main factors:  ability to speak English, the profession of professional qualifications  recognised in Australia and the need to have capital. In other  words, a new concept of immigration that discrimates against

traditional immigration, the policy of open door for poor people,  unwanted, oppressed and so on. What is your view on this?

Prime Minister

I don't think the new policy is designed to do this. Certainly,  of course, we place very high priority on family reunion, which  wasn't really mentioned amongst the three criteria and personally  I would place a higher priority on that because I think it is ...

almost than anything else. I think it is very difficult if  people have got their families partly here and partly half way  1  round the world. But at the moment, as you know, we do face  employment problems and it would be difficult to sustain the kind  of open door policy we might have had in the 1950s and '60s  without achieving a better employment position in Australia. If  we tried to have an open door policy now, with a significant number

of people in Australia unemployed, I think that we would get a  lot of opposition from the trade union movement and basically  the thrust of Australia's immigration policy has had support from  all political parties. I want to make sure it stays that way. We are trying:to increase the number coming in a bit and we want

to go on doing that. I think one of the tragedies was winding  down the migration programme when other things were running down,  and that tended to make people contract and I think it contributed  to the recession. But, building it up slowly, maintaining support,  giving high priority to family reunion, then I think those other

areas are given weight at the moment largely because of the  economic circumstances in Australia. Nothing will suit me more  when we get back to the position in which there can be a freer  flow of migration to this country once again.

Question

The Galbally Report recommended that the Committee on Overseas  Professional Qualifications should also investigate and advise  on the sub-professional and technical qualifications. This is an  area that applies to thousands of old migrants. Has the  Galbally recommendation been implemented?

We've been doing a good deal of work through, in, the industrial  relations arena because this gets into the question of trade  union acceptance of overseas qualifications quite apart from the  fact of whether the training is adequate, because if the trade

. . ./5

2EA

5

and training arrangements that have been introduced overseas  the Government can accept them - but if the trade union doesn't  then there is going to be industrial trouble all around the place.  There has been a great deal of patient work going on, not only

since Galbally, but on a continuous basis, and Tony Street's  Department has been very much involved in this and Employment  and Youth Affairs is also involved. We are trying to get to a  situation where there can be greater acceptance of overseas  qualifications. But it is not just a question of a Government  decision, it is not just a question of coming to a decision by  Government that a particular trade qualification is adequate, it is

also a question of bringing the trade union movement along with us.  Therefore, we have been working through tripartite groups involving  employers, employees and Government. I think the process and  the progress in these areas is often much too slow, but I think that

also appreciating the number of these areas where particular  trade groups have a position which has been built up over the years,  they are concerned that it is not going to be too much or too  rapidly broken down. They feel an obligation to preserve the  position of their existing members, people who have gained their  skills in Australia. That attitude has to be broken down. I think  progress is being made but again, not as much as the Government  would like.

Question Â·

It's a general situation. .

Prime Minister

Prime Minister (continued) .

It is a question of bringing people along in agreement because  if we brought in people who have skilled trades from Europe and  then we find that the local trade union movement won't accept those  skills, or for that matter the employers won't accept,:then they  won't be able to apply their skills in Australia or if they try

to, it could lead to significant industrial dispute. So that is  not really the way to go about it.

Question .  — — ..—

Another recommendation on the Galbally Report is the one to  give all migrants equal voting rights. What action has the  Fraser Government taken so far in this regard?

The Government is looking at this now, and I know the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has given a great deal of attention ’   to it. It is a difficult and a sensitive issue because, as you  would understand, even though Australia has changed very greatly

the earlier links with the United Kingdom are obviously much  closer than links with other countries. That was so for many  Australians and that is a fact of life. The question really is  as to whether any residual element of that ought to remain in the

recognition in relation to voting rights, whether all people should  be put on an equal footing. It is possible, because of Australia's  historic development, to have a legitimate argument both ways I think,

. ../6

- 6 -

Prime Minister (continued)

but the Minister for Immigration.has been giving a lot of  attention to it and the matter will be before the Government  fairly shortly.

Normally we say that we can vote for local Governments because  we are taxpayers. Shouldn't the same principle apply at State  and Federal level, being a taxpayer?

Prime Minister

I think a good deal can be said for people being citizens in  the full, sense. Being an Australian citizen and being able to vote in State and Federal elections —  I don't know that it comes ..  merely as a right because somebody lives in Australia. I think

if a person does want to live here and if they want to participate  in our own democratic processes, if they really want to contribute  to Australia, then it is fair enough to take out Australian  citizenship and to become an Australian in the full sense of the  term and really embrace this country. So I am not really in favour .   of something which just gives a person the vote just because they  happen to be in Australia. I think a demonstration is needed  on the part of the citizen that they are taking their living in  .  Australia seriously, that this is really where they want to live.

You could take an absurd position with somebody who is a traveller  around the world and if you did it really on residence, and let's  say there was a residential qualification of 12 months or something,  he could one election be voting in Australia, another election voting

in Canada, another election voting in Europe, but having no real  home anywhere. That just demonstrates part of the difficulty  I have with residential qualifications.

Question

Do you think the refugees flow should be totally absorbed by  the few traditional countries.of immigration which are obviously  underpopulated and richer in terms of economic resources, like  Australia, or should the whole Western world accept the  .responsibility?

I think for a major refugee, problem, the whole world has got  a responsibility. We've been trying to internationalise the  refugee problem from South East Asia. It is very difficult because  apart from America, Canada, Australia, and France, maybe one or  two others, there are very few countries that are showing any

interest at all. They are saying 'look, this is a problem remote  from us, we are not really involved in it so we are not going to  contribute to its solution'.  Now, that makes it difficult because  Vietnam has been actively promoting the export of its own

citizens. There are some signs that on a Government basis they  are again moving forward to encourage people to leave, to pay  the Vietnamese Government for the privilege and therefore the

.../7

7

Prime Minister (continued)

numbers could be very large.  Generally in a refugee situation  governments have tried to prevent people leaving. We know the  great exodus from Eastern Europe to the West and across to Berlin  and the construction of the Berlin wall. Four million people or  more (inaudible)to get out of Eastern Europe. But there people -

East European countries - Soviet Union was trying to prevent  the exodus. Vietnam has adopted a different approach and if  people don't like their regime well"go as quickly as you can fellow"  That carries the possibility of very very large numbers being

involved, which would obviously cause great difficulty for  Indonesia and South East Asia and for Australia. We are very  grateful for the assistance and help and the attitude being taken  by South East Asian countries. I think Indonesia in particular  has helped stop people landing unheralded and unannounced the way  the boat people on the northern coast. They don't stop all the  boats but they stop some of them, I think most. So in our own  region we have a good deal of cooperation but we don't have the  international concern which I believe the size of the problem  demands.

Question

According to official figures in Australia, there are about  50,000 illegal migrants. It is practically impossible to deport  all of them I suppose.  Wouldn't it be better to let them  legalise their position, after all they would become 50,000 . taxpayers as well?

Prime Minister

For all I know, they might already be paying taxes. I hope some  of them are. But, there are two problems with this. It is not  a simple question. We had one amnesty and people could have come  forward. Quite a large number did; not as many as we had hoped.

If you are going to have another amnesty people will say "oh well,  there will be another amnesty and another and another" and  in a sense therefore illegal migration would be encouraged. Now,  secondly, if illegal migrants are going to be enabled to stay in  Australia by one means or another, that in my view acts against

the interests of those who seek to migrate in the normal way; who  put their name down and within the system. They go on a waiting  list because they recognise we can't have everyone at once. I think  we've got to protect the rights of those who want to do it the

normal way, because if you are going to accept all the illegal,  migrants it will greatly reduce the number who could come in and  who do wait and go through the normal processes. When people  come here on a visitor's visa wanting to try and stay and they

do it because "we can get to Australia quickly on a visitor's visa"  —  I know quite well that you get some difficult cases, in a sense  heartbreak cases by applying a policy rigidly but I think a  Government is in a dilemma. There is a policy. Those who. are from

other countries who are sticking to the policy and wait their  turn to come here need to be protected. Their interests won't be  if we make it too easy for those who come here illegally. Again,  a lot of the problem I think gets back to economic circumstances. If we had greater employment prospects well then we would be

.. ./8

8

Prime Minister (continued)

delighted for more people to come. The waiting lists would be  less and I suppose there wouldn't be the pressure on illegal  immigration.

Question

A specific question on Radio Station 2EA. With the present set-up, the  41 different language groups we are covering for have not enough  broadcasting time and not everyone enjoys prime listening time. The Federal Government has already made money available for

a: new and more powerful transmitter which will start operating  as from July, the next. Also in July 2EA will have a different  frequency. Our problems could be solved, I suppose, retaining the  present frequency and transmitter together with the new one.

It has been estimated that the.extra cost would be almost  irrelevant. Could we have some comment on this? .

Prime Minister

I'm not sure that the Treasurer would say that the extra cost  would be irrelevant, but what you are really saying since there  is going to be a new and more powerful transmitter, can't you keep  the old one so you will have two transmitters, and there will be

two ethnic radios.

Question Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Â· Â·  '  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   * Â·

No actually. Just two frequencies which will give us more  time to distribute, to allocate, to these language groups we have,  particularly prime time, because some of them are suffering  from the sort of...

Prime Minister

I would be happy to take that up with the Minister for Post  and Telecommunications. There are already inquiries launched  about that because I was asked that same question at an ethnic  press conference that I had in Sydney a little while ago, but I  will make sure that I get an answer as quickly as possible.

Don't you find it is ironic that despite the fact that most  migrants come from Europe,  Australia is having problems entering  into trade with the European Economic market?

I think it find it very odd indeed. If there are any ways in  which migrants can bring some pressure to bear on their  home governments within the European Economic Community I would  be delighted, because we have had a very difficult time.. But a

few days ago we did initial an agreement with the European  Community on trade matters which doesn't give Australia great  access but it does open the door a little bit. We get better  provision for a number of commodities and a more secure provision.  Also, I believe, the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy is

. . ./9

9

going to break the European Community. It's almost unbelievable  that now they spend $25 billion a year on either export  subsidies or wage subsidies supporting particular industries.  That's almost an."inconceivable amount in Australia's terms. We've been arguing very vigorously for better access, as you know,  over the last three years. We do this because we were a

traditional supplier to Europe.  It is a very large trading group.   We do have many economic and social links with Europe. It is  a very wealthy group of 200 million to 300 million people. The markets are important to us. But we have made progress. There

is an initialled agreement. But at the same time, through your  own contacts with various European countries, I hope the point  will be made that some of the policies have not been very  reasonable.

Question

Prime Minister (continued) .

How can we argue our case for access to the Common Market when  our own levels of protection are so high.

Prime Minister

But they are not really you know. We've measured protection  in tariff terms or in qualitive restrictions and if you take all  protective devices in, I think Australia stands up pretty well. But it is really the level of access into a market that determines  whether it is protective or whether it isn't.- what people

ultimately end up by selling. Let's take the motor vehicle  industry. We reserve 20 percent of the local market for imports. If you take France, they will allow imports in to about 7% or  8% at the most; Britain, 12% or 13%; Italy 0.1%; Germany is  more open door and one or two of the other countries are more

open door(  but in spite of the European Community individual  countries have their own protective devices in the motor industry.  If you take employment sensitive areas like textiles, apparel  and footwear, Australia imports much more per capita than any  other developed country. If the ASEAN countries to our near  north had the same access to Europe and North America _and Japan  as they did to Australia they would be exporting an extra

$1,000 million worth of goods a year. Their exports to us have  been growing at between 30% and 40% a year. I know there is a  common view that Australia is a highly protected country, but  our tariffs are marginally higher than Europe's - only marginally^  We don't have all the levies and protective devices, the new

techniques of protection which Europe has developed. We don't  have the wage subsidies. We don't have the export subsidies. We can spend a lifetime developing a market in South East Asia;  flour as we had in Sri Lanka, and then Europe came along and said  we would like :that flour market in Sri Lanka, how much subsidy  would we need to push the Australians out of the market. That's

just the question they ask; how much subsidy? We don't enter into  that kind of competition. 14 million people cannot subsidise  their exports against 260 million people in Europe.

.../10

2EA 10

While there is protection in Australia very obviously, and  again during depressed economic circumstances you can't alter  that radically and Australian industry needs a certain level of  protection which we have indicated and made plain we will give it —   by and large, I think Australia's reputation is much better

than a number of journals would indicate. We've got some free  trade newspapers in this country. They write editorials on  saying how protectionist we are, and they get quoted overseas  and then it gets picked up. I think when that happens that we  are arguing against Australia's own interests because on any  objective judgement there are many countries around the world

infinitely more protectionist than Australia.

Question .  ........

Prime Minister (continued)

The last question is for our younger listeners. We have a special  weekly programme in the English language for children.. . .  Would you  like to send them a special message.

Prime Minister Ã¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ 'VÂ·;Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   '

Yes, I especially welcome that opportunity, because this is  the International Year of the Child and the future of any  country is very much dependent upon children. It's not .your future  and mine, it is the children's future which is going to count  and really determine what sort of country this is going to be.

I would like to wish you all the very best of good fortune  wherever you may be. I hope you work hard at school and I hope  you enjoy it a bit because you've got to go through the process  anyway and it is much happier if you can do it and enjoy it at

the same time. It is very important because how well you do  at school and afterwards depends what you do when you leave;  what sort of job you can get. I would just like to wish you all  the best for whatever you want to do and to make the point that  whether it is going to be bricklaying or labouring or a lawyer

or an accountant or a doctor or a schoolteacher, it is important  to pick something that you are going to enjoy doing. A job should be  Jnore than just work and a means of getting a livelihood. I think it  is terribly important to at least be able to enjoy a fair part  of what you are doing.and then it is much easier to put the effort

into it which is required if you are going to do it well. Nothing is worth doing unless you do put some effort into it. Good luck to you all, and especially for those who are leaving  school at the end of this year.
