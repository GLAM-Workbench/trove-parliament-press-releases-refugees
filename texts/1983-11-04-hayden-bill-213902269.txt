TWELFTH JO INT MEETING OF THE AUSTRAL IA- 1ND ONESIA

BUSINESS CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE

COOLANGATTA, 4  NOVEMBER 1985

MR CHAIRMAN, EXCELLENCIES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

I T  GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO ADDRESS THE TWELFTH

JO IN T MEETING OF THE AUSTRALIAÃ¢ÂÂ¢!NDONESIA BUSINESS

CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE. . '

SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1971 , THE BUSINESS

CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE HAS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE

IN FACILITATING  CONTACTS BETWEEN THE BUSINESS

COMMUNITIES OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES. . .

THE RANGE OF BUSINESSES REPRESENTED HERE, ÃÂ NCLUDING

MINING, SHIPPING, BANKING, ENGINEERING, " ,

CONSTRUCTION, METAL WORKING AND TOURISM, IS A

CLEAR TESTIMONY OF THE IMPORTANCE AND CONTINUING

V IT A L IT Y  OF THE COMMITTEE'S A C T I V I T IE S .

THIS IMPORTANCE STEMS NOT ONLY FROM THE COMMERCIAL

CO-OPERATION AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT SUCH MEETINGS

PRODUCE, BUT FROM THE EXCHANGES OF VIEW AND

MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED BY THE PARTICIPANTS

AND THE ORGANISATIONS THEY REPRESENT.

THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EASY.

PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS REFLECTIONS OF

THE CULTURAL GULF IS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE

INDIVIDUALISM OF AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY AND THE

CORPORATENESS OF INDONESIAN SOCIETY,

IN FURTHERING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, ACCOUNT

ALSO NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OF THE RAPID CHANGES . .

OCCURRING IN BOTH OUR SOCIETIES,

IN AUSTRALIA, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE HAVE BEEN RAPID

AND FAR REACHING SOCIAL CHANGES.

WE NO LONGER SEE OURSELVES AS A COLONIAL OUT-POST

OF. EUROPE BUT AS A TRULY MULT I-CULTURAL SOCIETY

WITH OUR OWN DISTINCT NATIONAL IDENTITY AND GOALS

THE INFLUENCE OF ASIA CAN BE READILY SEEN IN

AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLS, OUR EATING HABITS, OUR

SOCIAL AND ACADEMIC L IF E  AND IN THE CHANGING

DIRECTION OF OUR TRADE, . . . -

IN RECENT YEARS, THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY HAS

ACCEPTED LARGE NUMBERS OF AS I AN-AUSTRAL IANS

INTO OUR SOCIETY -  -INCLUDING THE 70,000

INDOCHINESE REFUGEES WHO HAVE COMB TO AUSTRALIA

SINCE 1975  -  ONE FOR EVERY 200  PEOPLE IN

AUSTRALIA,

THE IMPORTANCE THE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS

BEEN BUILT UP WITH INDONESIA OVER SEVERAL DECADES  , f '

WAS UNDERLINED BY THE PRIME M I N I S T E R ' S  V I S I T

I NOTE THAT TWO-WAY TRADE I N  RECENT YEARS BETWEEN

PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR. '

SIM ILARLY, AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN INDONESIA

HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST DECADE AND

NOW STANDS AT OVER 200  MILLION DOLLARS,

MORE THAN 50  AUSTRALIANÂ·COMPANIES HAVE ESTABLISHED

SUCCESSFUL JOINT VENTURES IN INDONESIA IN AREAS

AS DIVERSE AS GLASS, BUILDING MATERIALS AND THE

PRODUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL GASES.

Ã¢ÂÂ   , **Ã¢ÂÂ

I WELCOME THE EXPANSION IN TRADE.AND INVESTMENT

FOR SEVERAL MAJOR REASONS,

S  S  ÃÂ  l-

i n THE F I R S T  PLACE, MOST ECONOMISTS AND BUSINESS,

EXPERTS NOW RECOGNISE SOUTH EAST A S I A ,  COLLECTIVELY,

AS THE MOST RAPIDLY GROWING ECONOMIC REGION IN THE

WORLD,

INDONESIA WITH A HUGE POTENTIAL MARKET OF 150

MILLION PEOPLE, ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES, AND

.A RECENT HISTORY OF SUSTAINED, RAPID ECONOMIC

GROWTH IS IN MANY SENSES THE "KEY" ECONOMY OF

THE REGION AND OFFERS ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO

AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS.

WHILE MUCH HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN ACHIEVED IN DEVELOPING

THE COMMERICAL RELATIONSHIP, I BELIEVE MORE CAN BE

DONE, PARTICULARLY AS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF/Â·

EACH COUNTRY TO THE OTHER AS A TRADING PARTNER

REMAINS SO SMALL. ;

I THEREFORE HOPE THAT THIS MEETING HAS BEEN

ABLE TO I DEN TIFY AREAS WHERE TRADE CAN BE

STEPPED UP AND EXPANDED.

HAVING SAID T H I S ,  I T  IS IMPERATIVE AUSTRALIAN

BUSINESS SEIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES, BOTH IN

INDONESIA AND ELSEWHERE IN SOUTH EAST A S I A .

AUSTRALIANS AS A WHOLE ARE' I BELIEVE MORE FAMILIAR.

WITH SOUTH EAST A S I A  THAN MANY OF THEIR EUROPEAN

AND NORTH AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS AND MOST AUSTRALIAN

ENTERPRISES ARE GEARED TO MEDIUM SCALE PRODUCTION

TO WHICH MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE NOW

ATTACHING PR IO R I T Y .

S’ '

THE P O L I T I C A L  RELATIONSHIP IS OF COURSE OF FUNDAMENTAL

IMPORTANCE TO OUR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS. . .
