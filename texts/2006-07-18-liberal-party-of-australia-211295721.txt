PRIME MINISTER







VISIT TO EAST TIMOR





I will visit East Timor on 18 July 2006.  During the visit I will meet members of Australia’s  military and police deployment, who are continuing to do an excellent job in helping to  restore calm following the recent civil unrest.



The visit will also be an opportunity to underline Australia’s commitment to East Timor’s  long-term security and prosperity.  During the visit to Dili I will have discussions with the  President of East Timor, Xanana Gusmao, Prime Minister JosÃÂ© Ramos-Horta and the Special  Representative of the UN Secretary-General, Sukehiro Hasegawa.
