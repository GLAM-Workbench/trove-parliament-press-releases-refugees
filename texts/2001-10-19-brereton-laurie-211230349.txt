LEAKED DOCUMENTS REVEAL HOWARD’S FAILURE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

“Leaked  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  cables reported  in  the  Sydney  Morning Herald  newspaper  confirm  the  Howard  Government’s  diplomatic  failure  on  the  problem  of people smuggling”, the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, said today.

“Effective  action  to  crack  down  on  people  smugglers  requires  regional  and  bilateral cooperation”, Mr Brereton said.  “The flood of boats towards Australia can only be stopped by fixing our relationship with Indonesia.  A real solution must be found in Jakarta.  It won't be found in Nauru or PNG or elsewhere in the South Pacific.”

“It is clear that the Howard Government has conspicuously failed to secure the cooperation of  Australia’s  Asian  neighbours.   Indeed  John  Howard’s  politically-driven  handling  of  this issue is discouraging the cooperation required to suppress the people smuggling networks.”

“Record  numbers  of  illegal  immigrants  have  come  to  Australia  under  the  Howard Government.   In  the  past  ten  years,  13,500  illegal  immigrants  have  arrived  -  but  of  these 11,000  have  arrived  during  the  term  of  the  Howard  Government, with  numbers  of  arrivals skyrocketing over the last three years.”

“It has now been revealed that the Howard Government has been in possession of a steady flow of intelligence and diplomatic reports which have identified the names, addresses and operational  capacities  of  people  smuggling  networks  from  Iraq  and  Pakistan  to  the Philippines and Indonesia.”

“The  Government  has  long  had  the  intelligence  necessary  to  coordinate  a  regional  law enforcement  crack  down  on  this  trade.   Had  the  Government  acted  and  secured  the cooperation  of  Australia’s  neighbours,  many  boats  would  never  have  left  port  bound  for Australia.”

“Instead John Howard failed to act until the eve of an election.  MV Tampa was the 213th boat to arrive on his watch.”

“Howard's  belated  response  has  been  to  throw  millions  of  dollars  at  the  problem  to  gain political advantage on the eve of the election.  He has deployed a significant proportion of the Navy to the north at great expense, when it should be concentrating on its proper role of defending Australia from real military threats.”

“In addition to the costs of this naval deployment, John Howard has spent more than $100 million  to  dump  asylum  seekers  in  camps  in  Nauru  and  PNG  and  plans  to  send  more  to whatever other South Pacific country he can induce to take them until after the election.”

“John Howard's policy is ad hoc.  It is temporary.  It is no long-term solution.”

“It’s tricky because it won't last beyond the election.   And still the boats keep coming, one after another.”

“The  leaked  documents  revealed  in  today’s  Sydney  Morning  Herald  confirm  both  John Howard’s politically-driven approach and the absolute failure of his diplomacy.”

“Only a Beazley Labor Government is committed to put in place a real plan to crack down on  people  smugglers  across  our  region  and  strengthen  our  maritime  border  protection through the establishment of an Australian Coast Guard.”

“Australians  require  a  real  solution  which  last  and  work  -  and  which  will  stop  the  boats carrying illegal immigrants coming.”

Jakarta's silence left envoys all at sea

By Mike Seccombe

Australian  diplomats  in  Indonesia  could  not  even  get  Indonesian  authorities  to return  phone  calls,  much  less  help  stem  the  flow  of  boat  people  bound  for Australia, leaked documents show.

The  confidential  cables  indicate  the  Government's  attempts  to  stop  the  boats have caused authorities in Indonesia and Malaysia to reduce the amount of help they give.

One  of  the  documents,  a  restricted  cable  from  the  Australian  Ambassador  to Indonesia,  Richard  Smith,  on  October  7,  describes as  a  "sorry saga"  the  failed attempts  by  embassy  staff  to  have  Indonesian  authorities  stop  a  boat  which arrived off Christmas Island on October 6.

The  boat  will  be  remembered  as  the  one  from  which  some  asylum  seekers jumped and threw their children into the water when the Navy tried to force it out of Australian waters.

The  cable  records  that  authorities  were  aware  a  boat,  crewed  by  Indonesians and thought to be carrying up to 300 asylum seekers (there proved to be 187), was leaving Indonesia, intending to enter Australian waters.

After  it  appeared  off  Christmas  Island  on  October  6,  the  embassy  tried unsuccessfully  to  contact  representatives  of  the  Indonesian  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs  and  the  Office  of  the  Co-ordinating  Minister  for  Security  and  Political Affairs, Bambung Yudhoyono.

When  the  Indonesian  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  finally  was  contacted  -  by  the Indonesian Ambassador in Canberra - his main response was irritation at being disturbed on a Saturday, the cable notes.

He  said  he  would  talk  to  Mr  Yudhoyono  on  Monday.  The  Ambassador  noted there was no sense of urgency or desire to help Australia, and concluded: "Our strategy  in  this  sorry  saga,  apart  from  seeking  co-operation  in  having  the  boat returned  to  Indonesia,  has  been  to  try  to  raise  the  'ante'  and  to  cause  the Indonesian  Government  to  see  that  their  problem  with  the  PIIs  (potential  illegal immigrants) does not in fact end when they leave Indonesia's shores.

"To  a  large  extent,  this  has  been  frustrated  by  the  crude  and  unsatisfactory device of simply not communicating with us."

While the Government has claimed the inaction is largely due to resentment over Australia's role in East Timor, it is clear the politicisation of the boat people issue in Australia has undermined co-operative efforts to stop the flow.

A  confidential  cable  from  the  Australian  High  Commission  to  Malaysia  on September  13  says:  "The  Malaysian  Department  of  Immigration  has  withdrawn plans  to  assist  with  a  survey  by  a  High  Commission  officer  of  possible unauthorised departure points on the Johor coast.

"This  is,  at  least  in  part,  attributable  to  critical  reporting  in  the  Australian  press that Malaysia has not done enough to assist in efforts against people smuggling."

That  reporting  reflected  comments  by  Government  figures,  including  the  Prime Minister, John Howard.

The  source  of  the  leaked  documents  said  the  problem  was  not  a  lack  of intelligence  about  the  activities  of  people  smugglers  and  their  cargoes,  but  the Government's inadequate and politicised response to it.

He  cited  a  steady  flow  of  intelligence  and  diplomatic  reports  over  the  past  two years  from  Asia  which  identified  the  names,  addresses  and  operational capacities of people smuggling syndicates from Iraq to Manila.

"But the Government's response has been to task lower level officials to deal with the problem," he said.

"Noticeable  for  its  absence  has  been  any  sustained  effort  by  the  PM  or  senior ministers to cultivate better working relationships with their Asian counterparts."
