E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

Sam Walsh, the head of Rio Tinto, said last night ‘if you can’t trust the government, who can you trust’ and  this is the problem with the Gillard Government, you just can’t trust the Gillard Government. You couldn’t  trust the government on carbon tax, you couldn’t trust the government on detention centres, now it’s pretty  obvious that you can’t trust the government on the mining tax, you can’t trust the government to tell the  truth and you can’t trust this government to deliver.

When she became Prime Minister, because, as she said, the government had lost its way, Julia Gillard had  wanted to fix the mining tax, she wanted to fix boat people and she wanted to fix climate change. Well, all  of those fixes have unravelled and what that shows is that this is a government which is still absolutely lost.

QUESTION:

Should those three big companies then pull out of the mining tax deal that they did?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that those three big companies ought to be able to trust the Government to deal with them fairly  and squarely and plainly this is a government which said one thing before an election to try to win votes and  is doing something quite different after an election to try to cobble together a government.

QUESTION:

But is it not a problem for them that if the miners walk away from this deal that they struck, by July next  year they’ll be dealing with a Labor/Greens balance of power in both Houses and that they could end up  with something much worse?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the fact is that this is a government which should not tell lies. This is a government which should  honour its commitments. This is a government which shouldn’t say one thing before an election and do

something quite different after an election and the problem the Government’s got is that if this mining tax  unravels as it is now doing, they are going to have enormous trouble to meet their further commitment to get  back into surplus.

QUESTION:

Have you been talking to the miners behind the scenes, Mr Abbott, to egg them on a little bit?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the point I keep making to everyone is that when you deal with governments, you should be able to  trust what they say and the fact is that you can’t trust this Government to keep its word.

QUESTION:

But have you been having discussions with them and egging them on?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, the point is that this is a government which should tell the truth but which plainly it doesn’t tell the  truth. It said one thing before the election, it’s doing something quite different after the election.

QUESTION:

What should the Government do that it’s not already doing to stop banks from moving beyond the Reserve  Bank?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a government which is, on this issue, just all talk and no action. Every time interest rates go up, the  Treasurer goes out there and says how terrible it is but nothing changes. It is an ineffectual Government  which is basically being stood over on this issue.

QUESTION:

So what should the Government do, then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point is that the Government shouldn’t make commitments that it can’t keep. The Government  shouldn’t give the impression that it can do things and then not deliver.

QUESTION:

Can any government, though, prevent a bank from lifting interest rates or put pressure on them not to when  if they say that, look, they need to because the cost of borrowing for them is getting much harder?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s an interesting contrast here between the current Government and the former Government. During the life  of the Howard-Costello Government banks’ interest rates went up or down in accordance with changes  made by the Reserve Bank. Under this Government banks put their interest rates up in some cases well  ahead of the Reserve Bank’s interest rate rise and...

QUESTION:

Is that not due to global pressures though?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this is not a Government which is as good as managing global pressures as its predecessor. We didn’t  see this kind of behaviour by banks under the former Government and it’s a tribute to the good management  of the former Government and the comparatively poor management of the current Government that you see  this different behaviour by the banks.

QUESTION:

Did you ask John Howard to help you convince Malcolm Turnbull to stick on board? John Howard’s come  out and said, yeah, he played a role in convincing Malcolm Turnbull that now is not the time to leave  politics.

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I made constantly to Malcolm was that the Parliament can’t afford to lose good people and I think  it’s terrific that the Parliament has the best possible people in it.

QUESTION:

Did you ask John Howard to help have a word in his ear?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just think it’s terrific that we have got Malcolm in the Parliament still. I thought when he came into the  Parliament in 2004 that Australia was very lucky to have a man of his stature offering his life to public  service. Obviously, there’s been a few ups and downs since then but I think it’s greatly to his credit, greatly  to our nation’s benefit to have someone of that stature in the Parliament.

QUESTION:

Were you moved at all yesterday by Andrew Wilkie’s address to Parliament on Afghanistan?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think everyone respects the contribution that our colleagues are making in the Parliament and I think we’ll  hear a lot of very fine speeches on the subject of Afghanistan. An important subject tends to bring the best  out of our politicians, tends to produce the very best debate. So look, I’m conscious of his words, I’m  conscious of his strong feelings, but I’m also conscious of equally fine words and equally strong feelings on  the other side of the debate.

Thank you.
