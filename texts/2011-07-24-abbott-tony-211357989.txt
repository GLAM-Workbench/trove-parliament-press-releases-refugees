E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be here in Cherrybrook in the heart of the electorate of my friend and mentor Philip Ruddock.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be here with Peter McBeath at Peter McBeathÃ¢ÂÂs family pharmacy. This pharmacy has been here  for more than 20 years and Peter will say a few words in a moment about the carbon tax and about the  general state of retailing.

Look, IÃ¢ÂÂve been on a bit of a tour of Australia over the last few weeks talking about the carbon tax and the  danger it poses, but my tour is nothing like the tour that Cadel Evans has been on. Cadel has done every  Australian incredibly proud. What a mighty achievement, the Tour de France is the toughest endurance  event in the world. ItÃ¢ÂÂs never been won before by an Australian. I think Cadel Evans stamped himself as  AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs toughest sportsman with his triumph. IÃ¢ÂÂve got to say that as someone who likes to get on the bike  myself I am just so full of exhilaration and admiration for this great Australian on this tremendous day.

But look, to get back to the issues at hand for me as a politician the carbon tax is going to hit every small  business in the country. The Pharmacy Guild estimates that a typical pharmacyÃ¢ÂÂs power costs alone will go  up by at least $2,000 a year. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the direct costs. The indirect costs will go up and up and up because  power and transport are embedded in the price of everything.

We all know that retailing is very tough at the moment. There is report after report of a consumer strike.  Certainly most retailers report that this is the toughest retail environment in decades and the last thing that  small business needs at a time like this is yet another impost. So my message to the Prime Minister and to  the Government is there is no cure for this carbon tax, the only thing you can do that will help is drop the  toxic tax. ItÃ¢ÂÂs bad for consumers, itÃ¢ÂÂs bad for jobs, itÃ¢ÂÂs bad for AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs international competitiveness, it is  all bad and it should just be stopped.

I might ask Peter to say a few words from a pharmacy perspective and then Philip might like to add  something. Peter?

PETER MCBEATH:

Thanks Tony. Well, from my perspective the figure of $2,000 a year increase in our electricity bill is  possibly understated given that weÃ¢ÂÂve got an 18 per cent rise about to come through, so it could well be  more than that. The effect on our suppliers is really unknown, I have no idea how much of that they will  pass on to us. The real difficulty we have is, as TonyÃ¢ÂÂs said, retail is very difficult at the moment. IÃ¢ÂÂve been  here over 20 years, I canÃ¢ÂÂt remember it being as tough as it is at the moment. So weÃ¢ÂÂre struggling and people  are coming in and telling us that itÃ¢ÂÂs tough. I guess itÃ¢ÂÂs a lack of consumer confidence, Tony, that people  donÃ¢ÂÂt know whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on and they donÃ¢ÂÂt know whatÃ¢ÂÂs going to happen to them as a result of it, what  effect it will have on us in the long-term I donÃ¢ÂÂt know. All our costs are going up and our ability to recover  them is basically non-existent. You know, I think all retailers are finding it difficult and weÃ¢ÂÂre finding it very  difficult in the health care sector.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, Philip do you want to say something?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

Well, IÃ¢ÂÂd only add that IÃ¢ÂÂm finding, as I move around my electorate talking to people, they have enormous  difficulty in understanding why a government would want to, at such a difficult time for them and  particularly for us in this area and in New South Wales generally, to have an impost of this type imposed.  They wonder how you can come to a view, when youÃ¢ÂÂre the government of Australia thinking about the  welfare of Australians, that you would impose a penalty on simply people doing business, living their lives,  at a time when they need to be able to operate more effectively. The small business story here is part of what  weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing generally across the board. IÃ¢ÂÂm certainly getting it every day in my electorate.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting the costs of medicines are going to rise here? We obviously know electricity bills, but  medicines as well?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the cost of prescription medicine is set by the government and this is a particular problem for  pharmacies when they face increasing costs thanks to the carbon tax. The price they charge to consumers is  fixed, the costs that they have to pay to the pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers are fixed, so  theyÃ¢ÂÂre just getting squeezed. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why this is a particularly difficult impost for pharmacies and why  pharmacists that are faced with this further hit on their bottom line are going to inevitably start looking at  reducing services, reducing hours, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs bad for peopleÃ¢ÂÂs health when that happens.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, youÃ¢ÂÂve been using figures that show coal power will account for 10 per cent of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs  power in 2050, however the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs modelling say itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be 25 per cent regardless. Are you  whipping up unnecessary concern with figures that are, you know, two and a half times less than the  GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs using?

TONY ABBOTT:

If you look at the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own figures they say the standard coal fire power generation in 2050 will be  10 per cent. Now, yes they have a larger figure with carbon capture and storage but thatÃ¢ÂÂs assuming that

carbon capture and storage comes good and thereÃ¢ÂÂs no certainty on that. So itÃ¢ÂÂs that 10 per cent figure, itÃ¢ÂÂs  there in the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own documents released a couple of Sundays ago.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you make of a poll out today showing that voters in Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs own electorate are  turning away from her and the carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that reflects what I am getting from people right around Australia. I mean, the message that IÃ¢ÂÂm  getting right around Australia loud and clear from ordinary workers, from the people you meet in the street,  is they canÃ¢ÂÂt understand why at a time like this the Government would want to hit them with this great big  new tax. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why I say thereÃ¢ÂÂs no cure for this toxic tax. They can give us all the information in the  world, but the more information people get the less they like it.

As Paul Keating once said of another tax, he said Ã¢ÂÂif you donÃ¢ÂÂt understand it donÃ¢ÂÂt vote for it and if you do  understand it youÃ¢ÂÂd never vote for it.Ã¢ÂÂ ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem that the Prime Minister has got. What do people  see here? They see increases to their cost of living, they see threats to their jobs, they see a decline in  AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs international competitiveness and for what, and for what? If you look at the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own  figures under the carbon tax our emissions are going to increase from 578 million tonnes a year now to 621  million a year in 2020. So it just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work at the thing it is supposed to do, namely cut AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs  emissions.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, itÃ¢ÂÂs emerged that refugees or asylum seekers that are sent to Malaysia will be allowed to work  there. Do you think that itÃ¢ÂÂs still an effective deterrent then?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the problem is that since the Government announced the so-called Malaysian solution weÃ¢ÂÂve had ten  boats and more than 500 people arrive. So it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt worked so far. IÃ¢ÂÂm far from sure that it will ever work  and the fact is it is a blatant breach of promise from this Prime Minister, yet another broken promise from  this Prime Minister. I mean, the same Prime Minister who said “there will be no carbon tax under the  government I lead” and introduced a carbon tax said that she would never send boat people to countries that  havenÃ¢ÂÂt signed the UN convention on refugees and now sheÃ¢ÂÂs doing it. This is a Prime Minister who simply  canÃ¢ÂÂt be trusted because there is no solemn commitment that this Prime Minister makes that she wonÃ¢ÂÂt break  when she thinks itÃ¢ÂÂs in her interests to do so.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, when did you learn about Mary Jo FisherÃ¢ÂÂs problems?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think all I want to say about that is that itÃ¢ÂÂs a very, very regrettable incident, itÃ¢ÂÂs deeply out of  character. The matter is now before the courts where I understand it will be contested and she should be  extended the presumption of innocence.

QUESTION:

With FIFA, one of the architects of QatarÃ¢ÂÂs campaign has now been found to be corrupt, has been ditched.  Do you think Australia should be given another chance?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we were all incredibly disappointed at the outcome and I think a lot of people were I think suspicious  of the kind of tactics that might have been employed by some countries, the kind of methodology that might  have been employed in the decision that was made. Look, it really is a matter for the sporting organisations.  But certainly as an Australian I was incredibly disappointed at the outcome and if it could be different that  would be great.

QUESTION:

Just on Norway, with the country and what they are going through at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this would be incredibly traumatising for Norway and Norwegians and we had on a smaller scale a  similar act of sheer evil with the Port Arthur massacre back in 1996. So weÃ¢ÂÂve been touched by this kind of  mindless evil. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very hard to come to terms with and I suppose all we can hope is that people respond to  tragedy with the kind of courage and quiet virtue which is the best in human nature. Let us hope that having  seen the worst in human nature we can now see the best in human nature.
