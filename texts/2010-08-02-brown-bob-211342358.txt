Call to have Greater Sunrise plant in Timor Leste

In Darwin today, Greens Leader Bob Brown announced initiatives for Australia to help its poorest

neighbour, Timor Leste.

"The Greens campaigned for Timor Leste's freedom during its quarter century of occupation by the

Indonesian military forces, and we are now campaigning for more and better aid for the new century's rural

and medical wellbeing."

The Greens oppose Julia Gillard's proposal for asylum seekers to be processed in Timor Leste.

Senator Brown called on both Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott to back

Timor Leste's bid to have processing of the Greater Sunrise gas enterprise onshore in Timor Leste.

"This would be by far the biggest project to boost Timor Leste's economy and help fund the nation's future",

Senator Brown said.
