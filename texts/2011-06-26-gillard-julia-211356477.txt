PRIME MINISTER  TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BONGIORNO, JESSICA  IRVINE AND MALCOLM FARR  MEET THE PRESS

26 JUNE 2011

E & O E - PROOF ONLY

Subjects:      Carbon pricing; taxation; agreement with Malaysia;  Indonesian live export suspension; the Greens; gay marriage; women in  politics

HOST: Good morning Prime Minister.

PM: Thank you very much Paul.

HOST: Well that tax auction, Tony Abbott’s offering tax cuts without price  rises. Pretty good deal?

PM: Well Paul let’s actually talk this through. Of course I want to tackle  climate change by putting a price on carbon pollution that polluters will pay,  and then use that money to assist Australian families. So I can confirm today  that 9 out of 10 households will get assistance, that’s seven million  Australians getting assistance. We want to help people through tax cuts,  through changes to family payments, and of course through pension rises as  well for older Australians, for veterans, for carers, and the vast majority we  assist actually won’t pay any price because of the assistance that they  receive.

Now Tony Abbott is talking about tax cuts, but there’s absolutely no details  available. This is the equivalent of putting out a glossy brochure that says tax  plan and then when you open it up all of the pages are blank.

HOST: He says he’s in opposition and really doesn’t have the resources to do  it.

PM: Well Tony Abbott has said in the past that in Opposition they can’t do  comprehensive budget replies or put out tax plans, Oppositions before of  course have been able to do these things but Tony Abbott has said he lacks  the capability to do it. Well today I do want to make an offer to Tony Abbott  because I do believe Australians should be able to judge this on the basis of  all the facts and figures; not slogans and assertions. So I’m prepared to make  available to Mr Abbott officials from Treasury to work with him in the coming  week to cost whatever he says he wants to do in tax so that we can see what  it means and the billions of dollars that it would cost.

Now he’s already coming to this task with an $11 billion black hole on the  budget bottom line, he’s already coming to this task saying that he wants to  charge Australians families $720 a year to pay for his climate plan-

HOST: He can have Treasury officials this week helping prepare his tax plan  for release when, before the next election, at the next election, at the same  time as you unveil yours?

PM: Well I think the appropriate thing would be for him to then provide the  details before the Parliament rises at the end of the week after. Paul let’s just  be very clear about the position that Mr Abbott is in-

HOST: So you will give him all the resources or just a couple of Treasury  boffins?

PM: Well we’d give him the resources from Treasury that would be needed to  cost a tax plan from Mr Abbott. Now let’s just be very clear here, he’s already  saying to Australian families that his climate change plan, which the experts  say won’t work, will cost families $720 per year. So he wants to put tax up,  now he’s saying he-

HOST: (inaudible)

PM: Well it’s beyond dispute that it’s going to cost people because he’s going  to take money and use it for ineffective policies. So he’s going to put tax up by  $720 per household, now he’s saying he’s going to put tax down. Well that’s  very confusing, let’s not have the slogans and assertions, let’s have the  details. Mr Abbott can have resources from Treasury to cost a tax plan,  they’re available to him this week-

HOST: So this is a real offer not a stunt?

PM: Well I think Australians would be entitled to say Mr Abbott’s talk about tax  is a stunt unless he takes this offer up Paul. We’re saying if he’s got a tax plan  we’ll make the expert resources available to him to cost it. Now if he doesn’t  take that offer up I think people are entitled to say ‘well this tax plan is a  figment of his imagination because he’s got no idea where the money’s

coming from.’ I know where the money’s coming from for my assistance to  families, it’s coming from big polluters who’ll pay the price. We’re entitled to  say to Mr Abbott ‘where’s the money coming from?’ Here’s a good opportunity  for him to explain it all.

HOST: Well let’s go back to where this whole argument began. I just wonder if  this statement is one you most regret over the past 12 months?

PM clip: There will be no carbon tax under the Government I lead.

What did you mean when you said that?

PM: Paul I understand many Australians have looked at that statement and  then looked at me and the plan to price carbon and have said to themselves  ‘gee she didn’t tell us the truth before the last election’, I absolutely  understand that. During the last election campaign we were talking about the  best way of pricing carbon and I believe the best way of pricing carbon so we  can tackle climate change is to have an emissions trading scheme. Now we’re  going to get there Paul but through a fixed price period; effectively like a tax.  So Australians are looking at me and saying ‘what did she mean then?’ Well I

am doing something different now Paul, I want to be really frank about that,  but I’m doing something different in order to make the right decision for the  nation. We’ve got to tackle climate change, we’ve got to price carbon, we’ve  got to get to an emissions trading scheme and we will get there.

HOST: Well there’s a question from Facebook from Kurt McAllister, who says  why won’t you publically acknowledge that the Greens are the reason the  Government is pushing ahead with a carbon tax?

PM: Because that wouldn’t be the truth. We’re pushing ahead with pricing  carbon because we’re determined to tackle climate change Paul and the best  way of tackling climate change is to put a price on carbon and that’s what  we’re going to do. Now Paul I understand people looking at that statement  before the last election would say to themselves ‘she said no carbon tax then,  there’s going to be a carbon tax now’ but it’s a stepping stone to getting to  where I always wanted this nation to get to and what I’ve talked about before  the election campaign which is an emissions trading scheme to tackle climate  change. So it’s a different way of getting there and I’m happy to keep  explaining to people that we will get to a place that tackles climate change the  most efficient way.

JOURNALIST: Good morning Prime Minister.

PM: Good morning.

JOURNALIST: Whether or not you agree that Scott Morrison needs to go to  Malaysia to ask these questions, those are valid questions that he’s raised in  Parliament about the funding. You’ve outlined $292 million of funding for this  agreement, is that for a year, is that for six years, 20 years? How long is that  funding for?

PM: Well I can be very clear about this. $76 million of that funding is to  facilitate the transfer agreement with Malaysia. The rest of the funding is  about us taking extra refugees. We’ve said under this arrangement that we  would take 4000 more refugees. I believe that that’s the right thing to do.

What we’re aiming to do here is to break the people smuggler’s business  model, so if you get on a boat you end up at the back of the queue in  Malaysia whilst we take 4000 more genuine refugees from the front of the  queue and the vast majority of the money is to facilitate taking more refugees.

JOURNALIST: So I guess it’s a question of how long does that take?

PM: Well of course we provided the funding over the forward estimates period  like every other line item in the Government’s budget, health and education  and defence, they’re all account for over the forward estimates period. What  I’m really asking the Opposition and the Liberal Party to do today is to show  some financial responsibility too, I’ve made a very generous offer about  seeing whether or not they can stack up funding over the forward estimates  period and show us where the money’s coming from for some of their big  spending promises like their chatter about tax cuts.

JOURNALIST: So if that part of the deal has been negotiated how long before  we’ll see some ink on the paper, how long before this agreement will become  a reality?



PM: Well we’re in very advanced discussions with Malaysia, some time back I  was in a position to put out a statement, a joint statement with the Prime  Minister of Malaysia, to inform people that this was our intention and  Malaysia’s intention. Since then we’ve worked on negotiating the details and  we’re in very advanced discussions.

JOURNALIST: Days away?

PM: Well I’m not going to give a timeframe but I am going to say to you this is  the toughest possible step we could take against people smuggling. So at the  end of the day when you step back in this debate I want to break the people  smugglers’ business model and when you look through all of the stunts from  Scott Morrison what he’s actually saying is: the message he wants to send to  people smugglers is you can still get people to Australia, they’ve got to come  via Nauru. The message I want to send to people smugglers is: you can’t get  people to Australia.

JOURNALIST: Well Prime Minister you call it the tougher of the two options,  others would say it’s the cruellest of the two options, how do you feel  personally about being behind what is now considered one of the cruellest  methods to stop asylum seekers?

PM: Well I don’t agree with that characterisation. There’s nothing  humanitarian about people getting on boats and risking their lives. We’ve  seen people lose their lives doing that, we’ve seen children drown, we saw  that on our shoreline of Christmas Island just before Christmas here in  Australia. So we’ve seen kids drown Malcolm, any steps we can take to make  sure people don’t get on boats are the right thing to do, and then in this

Malaysian agreement we’ll take 4000 more genuine refugees, there’ll be kids  amongst that number too.

HOST: Well Northern Territory cattlemen came to Parliament during the week  with this heartfelt plea:

Rohan Sullivan clip: We want this fixed, we want it fixed because not  only do we care about the animals we produce and what happens to  them, but the livelihoods of thousands of people right across northern

Australia are at risk.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is involved in negotiations with  Indonesia on the live cattle trade. At the moment he’s in Africa, then he’s  going to Kazakhstan, then he’s going to Burma. Apparently in Kazakhstan he  might have some pull asides or some sort of meetings with Indonesia and  Malaysia authorities at that meeting. That’s hardly getting him involved up to  his ears in this problem isn’t it?

PM: Well Kevin Rudd has been involved in this work, in getting the live export  trade resumed to Indonesia. Let’s be very clear about this, I don’t want this  trade suspended one day longer than is necessary to ensure that we can deal  with animal welfare issues, and when I’ve spoken to representatives of  cattlemen they’ve said to me they don’t want to see their animals treated like  that. So they want an assurance too that the animals will be treated  appropriately in Indonesia, that’s what I want and I don’t want the trade  suspended one day longer than necessary to ensure animal welfare. Now in  terms of the team that’s working on this of course I’m working on it personally,  Joe Ludwig is working on it as our Agriculture Minister, Kevin Rudd’s been  involved in appropriate discussions with his counterpart in Indonesia, Craig  Emerson our Trade Minister has also been involved in discussions with his  counterpart and we’ll keep pushing at all levels to get the animal welfares  issues right and to resume this trade.

JOURNALIST: How confident are you that you’ll get a decent outcome from  the MLA, the meat and livestock organisation, given they knew about all this  about a year ago and did nothing?

PM: Well I have been concerned that there wasn’t enough response when the  Minister Joe Ludiwg said to the MLA earlier this year ‘I want a plan on animal  welfare’ that there wasn’t sufficient response from them, there was a scanty  document in March and then not much more in May. So we’ve got to get this  right now, we will be pressing MLA to get it right, we will be pressing to  resume the trade with Indonesia under appropriate circumstances and that  requires two things: it means we’ve got to have the right standards in the  abattoirs that Australian animals are headed to and we’ve got to have the  ability to track where Australian animals go so we’re putting in place both.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister Paul Holmes ÃÂ¡ Court, who actually supported  your ban, a couple of weeks ago he thought it would only take three to four  weeks to fix this up, is that being too optimistic?

PM: Well we’re going to be working and we are working as hard as we can to  resume this trade. We’re not letting the grass grow under out feet Paul we’re  getting on with this as quickly as possible.

[Break in broadcasting]



JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you’re probably not aware because you’ve  been in transit but the Greens are going to have 69 shadow portfolios, but  Greens Leader Bob Brown today said that he was confident of an agreement,

a carbon pricing agreement sometime in the next month, and he called it a  platform. Now what did he mean by that, is this agreement just going to be the  start of further negotiations or is it going to be just a statement of principles or  is this going to be the beginning and the end of what the Government’s going  to introduce?

PM: Well obviously I can’t speak for Senator Brown so you’d have to ask him  to clarify his words. What we are working towards and we’re working towards  with good faith and progress is being made, is a plan to price carbon, to get

the big polluters to pay, and to use that money to assist Australian households  - 9 out of 10 households getting assistance, that’s millions of Australians that  will have money in their pocket as a result of the way in which we will get big  polluters to pay. Now that is the best way of making sure that we tackle  climate change. Yes of course there are other measures in place like our  renewable energy target and they will continue to be there, but those other  measures will have less work to do when we put a price on carbon which is  the most efficient way of tackling climate change.

JOURNALIST: So it’ll be a complete package that you will announce in the  next month or so and apart from any things that might come up with drafting  of legislation, there won’t be any further negotiations or add-ons of  subtractions?

PM: We are working towards announcing a complete package and that  means I’ll be able to say to Australians, every Australia, this is how it’s going  to work, this is how much money is coming in your direction, this is what the  big polluters are paying and this where the money is coming from, it’s coming  from big polluters. Today of course I’ve spoken to Paul about making an offer  to Tony Abbott to say well get your facts and figures out, we know you want to  put a $720 a year tax slug on Australian families, now you’re talking about tax  cuts as well, you appear to not have any idea where the money’s coming  from, we’ll give you some Treasury officers to cost your plan, Australians  deserve better than slogans and generalities and figments of imagination in  the public debate.

JOURNALIST: So Prime Minister just thinking beyond issues, beyond climate  change, when the Greens do have that increased power in the Senate, I  mean it’s been a frustrating year for you, are you sort of looking forward to  having you know sort of a greater ability to get your agendas through the

Senate? Are you excited about having a Green balance of power in the  Senate?

PM: I haven’t experienced difficulties in getting legislation through, I’ve done  the talking, done the work, done the negotiating and the Government’s  delivered in it legislative agenda. We’ve put more Bills through this Parliament

than the Howard Government did in its first year. There’s not one amendment

that’s been carried that the Government wasn’t supporting. So we’ve  delivered our legislative agenda day after day, very big pieces of legislation  like the structural separation of Telstra, a microeconomic reform that eluded  the previous Government and for consumers Australians will mean more  choice, more options, more competition, better prices. So the Parliament is  working and working well.

JOURNALIST: Yet there are calls on you to go further on some issues, for  example over the weekend we’ve had New York State pass legislation to  legalise gay marriage and also WA Labor delegates, you know, met on the  weekend and decided that that’s an issue that’s important to Australia, and  that means that there’s WA, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania,  Northern Territory all in support of action to legalise gay marriage in Australia.  What will it take to convince you that that’s something that’s worthy of putting  on the legislative agenda?

PM: Well I think we’ve got to be clear about the two different propositions  you’ve asked me about. Is the Parliament working now? Yes it is. The  Government’s legislative agenda is going through, with the Senate changing  on the first of July I’m very confident the Government will continue to deliver  the legislation the nation needs so we’re making the right choices, pricing  carbon, the right choices in health, right choices in education, the right  choices to bring the budget back to surplus as promised and all of that is  going through the Parliament.

Then of course we have Labor Party people come to Labor Party  Conferences and talk about ideas. People who go and take out a Labor Party  ticket are normally people who are full of enthusiasm about public debate.

HOST: Will these ideas convince you that gay marriage should be there?

PM: I will continue to have my view but as Labor Leader I am not someone  who’s interested in closing debate down, I think it’s good that people come to  Labor Party meetings and want to talk about ideas, they’re doing it now and  they’ll do it at National Conference later this year.

HOST: On sixty minutes you gave Australians a glimpse of your relationship  with Tim, some commentators though that this scene was demeaning of you  as Prime Minister:

TIM MATHIESON: She’s doing as she’s told.

PM: I’m hanging on the outside of the shed as instructed.

JOURNALIST: Ostensibly that was about promoting men’s issues and the  right for men to talk quietly about their health, but how do you feel is has  affected you in the last year, being the first female Prime Minister. That was a

big deal a year ago that we got our first Prime Minister, there’s not been much  talk about that now, have you felt that it’s been harder for you as a woman?

PM: In my day to day moving around a still feel that, I get any number of  women come up to me and want to talk about me being the first female Prime  Minister. I get any number of mums and dads who bring up their young  daughters or ask me to sign something for their young daughters.

HOST: I don’t mean to be rude but we’re rapidly running out of time, do you  think that that was demeaning, that you should have been allowed in the  shed, in 5 seconds?

PM: No I don’t, we were having a little joke.

HOST: Thank you very much for being with us today Julia Gillard.

PM: Thank you.
