PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE RECALLED

Independent Member for Calare Peter Andren has joined Independent Senate   colleague Brian Harradine in seeking an urgent re-call of Parliament.

“I agree totally with Senator Harradine that Australia faces a national crisis in the East   Timor disaster.

“The humanitarian and refugee crisis is obvious. We also face a long term crisis in   our relationship with Indonesia.

“The Parliament needs to be recalled to debate the matter and to unite in resolutions to   meet the crisis,” Mr Andren said.

“Members need to pass on the overwhelming concerns of their constituents and report   back on our course of action.

“Under standing orders Parliament can only be recalled at the request of a majority of   members. I have written to the Speaker of the House in an attempt to create that   majority,” Mr Andren said.
