ANCILLARY USE FOR HOSTELS PROPOSED

Mr. Les Johnson,  MHR for Hughes, believes the Commonwealth should

put to immediate use the unused capacity of migrant hostels under

Commonwealth control.

"State and local government authorities, and welfare organisations

have a constant demand placed upon them by needy people seeking

short-term accommodation",  he said.

While acknowledging that the prime function of migrant hostels was

to provide for the immediate accommodation needs of migrants and

refugees accepted into Australia,  the fact that most of the hostels ÃÂ '

have been operating largely under capacity in the last few years,

has provided a resource which can be used for other purposes.

Mr. Johnson said that in his electorate the East Hills Migrant

Centre, had only this last financial year achieved maximum capacity.

In 1976-77 the hostel was closed, and for the years 1977 to 1979

inclusive, maximum occupancy was not achieved. v

"In NSW the "Endeavour" Migrant Centre, the hostels at Cabramatta,

Fairy Meadow and Westbridge have not been fully occupied in the

last two years".

In all other States, all hostels have been operating at below

capacity for the last five years.

Mr. Johnson said that the Commonwealth had expended $853,000 on

maintenance and the improvement of existing hostels throughout

Australia in the last three years.

"In the absence of the full utilisation of the facilities by the

Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  measures should be

taken to ensure the hostels are not left idle",  he said.
