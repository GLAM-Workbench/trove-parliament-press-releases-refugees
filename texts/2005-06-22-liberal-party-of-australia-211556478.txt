Two important Tasmanian projects have received financial support under the latest round of the  Australian Government’s Local Answers funding.

Federal Member for Bass Michael Ferguson said that the programmes help families in the  community to build their skills and abilities to resolve issues and create opportunities.

Mr Ferguson is pleased to announce the following funding:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $286,050 for the Migrant Resource Centre’s Family Initiative.   This project will address a broad range of family relationship and parenting issues for refugee groups  in Northern Tasmania.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $50,000 for Whitelion Tasmania Role Model. This project is designed to inspire and equip students  in disadvantaged areas to address issues facing them and to develop leadership.

“The Local Answers initiative is part of the Government’s Stronger Families and Communities  Strategy,” Mr Ferguson said.

“This is a way of helping strengthen communities by funding local, small-scale, time limited  projects.

“Local Answers is a sincere example of the Australian Government’s continued commitment to  helping communities like Northern Tasmania.

“This funding I’ve announced today reflects how the Government values organisations like the  Migrant Resource Centre and Whitelion. They both provide a valuable service to members of the  community who might sometimes feel left out.”

Due to the success of the initiative, the Australian Government has committed a further $70 million  to the expansion of Local Answers, bringing the total funding to $137 million over four years.

Mr Ferguson said that as a result of this further commitment, bi-annual funding rounds will now take  place, giving local families in our community the power to develop their own solutions and help  them to help themselves.

Future Local Answers funding rounds will be advertised on www.michaelferguson.com
