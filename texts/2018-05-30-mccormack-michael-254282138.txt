TRANSCRIPT

THE CONVERSATION: POLITICS WITH MICHELLE GRATTAN  30 MAY 2018



Subjects: The National Party, trade, migration, live export.

Speaker:



From The Conversation, this is Politics with Michelle Grattan. A podcast where we hear from  politicians and experts on the issues of the day.

Michelle Grattan:

Michael McCormack won The Nationals leadership after Barnaby Joyce resigned amid the  scandal surrounding his affair with his former staffer and now partner Vikki Campion. This  week, The Nationals are again dogged by the Joyce fallout, with the couple who now have a  baby selling a tell-all interview for a reported $150,000. That's overshadowed a surprising  bit of good news for the party this week. The recruitment to their ranks of Tasmanian  crossbench Senator Steve Martin. Michael McCormack is our guest today, and please forgive  the rather echoey audio from the recording done in his office.

Michael McCormack we have to start with Barnaby Joyce. He rained on your parade this  week with his TV deal. Did you ask for a please explain from him and have you had much  feedback from the electorate about this issue?

Michael McCormack:

Look, I don't think he rained on the parade. He didn't attend the party room meeting when  Steve Martin was welcomed in as the new newest National. The first senator representing  The National Party ever from Tasmania and he made the deliberate decision not to attend  the party room for that reason. So full marks to him there.

2



End of the day, Barnaby's made a personal choice - he and Vikki to go down this path with  the TV deal - that's a personal decision for him. And look, at the end of the day, I haven't  been approached by people in my electorate or elsewhere in regional Australia and I know  the story broke at the weekend and I've been out and about. I attended many functions on  the weekend. No one raised the story with me, but what they were talking to me about  were the fact that their jobs - jobs for themselves, jobs for their kids, power prices, all the  sorts of things that people normally raised with me. When I was out about on the weekend,  they’re the sorts of issues that they wanted to talk to me about.

Michelle Grattan:

While you say it’s a personal thing, that is true at one level but it also goes to the sort of  standards that MPs set and live by, don't you think?

Michael McCormack:

Well I suppose we set our own standards. We are accountable to our electorates. At the end  of the day all politics is local and, as I said yesterday and I'll say it again right now, the court  of public opinion will judge us on how they think we're performing, how they think we're  delivering. Certainly, I know Barnaby has delivered for New England but we're all  accountable by our own actions and by our own words and deeds and that's how we'll be  judged and we'll be judged at the ballot box.

Michelle Grattan:

Do you think that, all things considered, Barnaby Joyce will or should run at the next  election?

Michael McCormack:

Well, that'll be a matter for him and that'll be a matter for the National Party in New  England. That'll be a matter for a branch to nominate him and then that'll be a matter for  the branch members in New England as to whether or not they decide if he nominates, or if  anybody else nominates, and it becomes a preselection process as to who they think would  best represent them going forward.

Michelle Grattan:

I notice you're not saying of course he should.

Michael McCormack:

Well again, that's entirely a matter for Barnaby and the electors of the National Party of  New England. And, you know, we saw in the seat of Ryan with Jane Prentice. Now, Jane put  her hand up again and she's been an outstanding member of Parliament but, at the  grassroots level, her preselectors in Ryan felt as though they wanted somebody else to  represent them. Now, that's democracy at work. And the Liberal and National parties don't  parachute people into local electorates. They don't make it such that the executive  determines who is going to represent local people. That's up to local people to decide.  That’s how it should be and that's how it will be in New England.

Michelle Grattan:

So it’s possible he won’t run?

Michael McCormack:

Well, anything's possible in politics.

Michelle Grattan:

Now, turning to the Budget, how are the income tax cuts going down in the bush? What are  the reactions of people in the electorates that you visit?

Michael McCormack:

Well look, a lot of the electorates I visit are framed and based on small and medium family  enterprises. Mum and dad businesses, many of which have been there for generations. They  love the tax cuts. They love the fact that they're paying 27.5 cents in the dollar - the lowest  the tax rate has been for 78 years. They love the fact that we've extended the instant asset  write-off by yet another 12 months. That goes down well. But also a lot of them deal with  the Coles and the big companies - the Woolies of the world. And they also acknowledge  that, quite frankly, a lot of their kids - and these are the constituents I talk to - a lot of their  kids working at Coles and Woolies, and we know that packing supermarket shelves is  sometimes the first item on somebody’s CV, on their resume. And the fact is, big business  deals a lot with small and medium enterprises and a lot of them in regional Australia  producing the food items which adorn our grocery shelves. So, the fact is, we are going to  the next election with the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan and the full suite of measures that  Mathias Cormann and Treasurer Scott Morrison have developed. And it's a good policy.

Michelle Grattan:

Now, some of the Nationals’ electorates of course are quite poor. Would people prefer, in  many cases, the money spent on services than tax cuts, whether income tax cuts or  company tax cuts?

Michael McCormack:

Well people also need to differentiate from when we say services. There is this  misconception out there that the Federal Government is responsible for everything. State  schools were always called state schools for that very reason that they were funded by state  governments. Public hospitals were always funded by state government but there’s this-  there’s no lines of difference these days and everybody seems to think that the Federal  Government is responsible for everything and we're not. You know, we…

Michelle Grattan:

[Interrupts] Well, well can I just interrupt there. You are in a sense. Malcom Turnbull’s  bosting you’re giving a lot more money schools, for example.

Michael McCormack:

And we are. And that's because now we've got our prints very much on the sticky paper and  we are and we do. And we’re spending a record amount of money in education and for  public schools. Now that's a good thing. I'm certainly, you know, if you're a parent of a child  going to school, you want the best possible start for them so that they can get a future  career et cetera, et cetera. And that is why we are funding public hospitals and public  schools, and we're doing it in record amounts of money year on year going forward. But,  again, the fact remains they are largely the responsibility of State Governments, but we're  more than carrying our share of the financial burden - financial responsibility - I should say.  It's not a burden. It's actually a good thing that we are making better outcomes for health  and education, particularly in regional areas.

Michelle Grattan:

Just to tie up on income tax cuts. Do you think that people are comparing your package  favourably to the Labor package, even though the Labor package gives more to lower and  middle income earners in the early days, and you have this third stage of the Government  package, which is quite controversial because it gives to higher income earners?

Michael McCormack:

Well people are always saying to me that they are looking to politicians and to governments  and to parliaments for long term vision. Now that's what we're offering. Look, I don't ever

5

believe what Labor says. I look at what Labor has done in the past when it has been in  government and it's not a pretty sight. And people, surely they haven't got that short a  memory that they can't- that they fail to remember what Labor did when they were in office  in six years federally, and Labor stands for higher taxes and, therefore, less jobs. And when  you actually have company tax cuts across the board you actually have the provision there  and the opportunity there for more jobs, more employment. You also have the provision  there for higher wages because companies do invest and reinvest in their most important  resource and that is their people, their staff.

Michelle Grattan:

Now, turning to another issue, I know that you personally in The Nationals generally support  the continuation of the large sheep export trade, but a number of Liberals are in revolt  about this and its considerable public feeling. Do you think this trade will continue in the  longer term and does that include the northern summer trade?

Michael McCormack:

I think David Littleproud has done- no I don't think, I know David Littleproud had done an  outstanding job in what has been a very difficult period and Australia is the only country  which exports animals which has an export supply chain assurance scheme. So, from farm  gate to point of destination we have that scheme in place, that system in place where  animal welfare is number one. And certainly, with the live sheep trade to the Middle East in  the northern summer, we've made provisions such as the stocking density has been reduced  by 28 per cent, which gives the animals 39 per cent more room to move about in the pens  on the ship.

We've also said that we will put in place, and have put in place, independent inspectors who  will report on a daily basis to the department, to the Government. And we've said we're  going to look at the report prepared by Dr Michael McCarthy in more detail to see what else  we can do. But this is important. The Middle East, Kuwait and UAE and Qatar are important  trading partners with Australia. Now, if we don't fill their needs and wants some of those  countries which also get chilled sheep meat - they'll stop those orders as well. And what the  orders will be filled by countries which don't have animal welfare front centre of their  export…

Michelle Grattan:

But should we give in to that sort of threat?

Michael McCormack:

6

Well, at the end of the day our farmers will miss out and that will mean less jobs for  Australians and less export opportunities for this nation. And so it is all about the West  Australian and South Australia farmers getting - and there are some Victorian and New  South Wales sheep which also fill the numbers for this export trade - those farmers will miss  out. And when those farmers miss out their communities miss out and the nation suffers as  a result.

Michelle Grattan:

On another front a Northern Territory abattoir outside Darwin is now set to close and the  pastoralists up there are saying they'll have to find another facility for their cull cows and  bulls. Some 200 people I think are employed in that abattoir. Did The Nationals look at any  way of keeping this going - after all the Government's putting money to abattoir training  abroad - what about this one on the home front?

Michael McCormack:

Well look this is the latest in a long line of top end abattoirs which really struggle and then-  and you know, these people in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney who say well,  why don't we just process all the livestock here in Australia and then box it over to  Indonesia, and the Middle East and elsewhere? I mean they're kidding themselves. They've  got absolutely no idea of the challenges faced by those operators of those meat processing  plants in the north.

Michelle Grattan:

What is the problem?

Michael McCormack:

Well there's any number of problems. First of all it's getting the stock when they need it.  Weather plays a part. The fact is you know, linking in with the markets plays a part and  getting just the number of workers to be able to fill the processing lines is a big, big  challenge. Right across regional Australia it's a challenge to find workers to fill positions. And  I know that Steve Ciobo and Mark Coulton have done such a great job on the trade front.  There are so many market opportunities and at times companies in Australia, agribusiness  and value adding plants and factories are finding it difficult to keep up the demand that's  been enhanced by these free trade agreements with China, South Korea, Japan and  elsewhere that we just can't find the workers to enable these factories to expand to put on  more processing lines

Michelle Grattan:

So what is the problem in getting these workers? Is the nature of the work?

Michael McCormack:

Well it’s also cyclical. It's also seasonal. So in one- it's like any of these business operations  where they have a whole- they get swamped with a whole lot of stock to process it in one  given period and then they've got no work whatsoever in another period. And so it's just  difficult to have employment contracts with people when you're only able to guarantee  them employment for three or six months and then there's no work going forward. But then  we want you back when the season resumes. It's just so difficult. But you know, there's so  many other factors come into play that it's never ever been easy to have meat processing  plants operate viably in the north.

And that's why, when I say these people who sit at home and sip on their lattes and get out  of bed at 11 o'clock and walk around and count the amount of carbon in the air and you  know, they've got their head up the backside most of the time, they don't understand. They  don't understand the challenges faced by regional Australia and they don't understand the  challenges faced in the north. And at the end of the day the Indonesians, like the Middle  Eastern countries, they want live animals. We’re there, we can provide that opportunity,  that export trade and we can provide the animals. And we can do so with that Export Supply  Chain Assurance Scheme in place such that animal welfare is placed front and centre. We're  doing it. We're doing it well. But we're getting stymied all the way by people who've got  quite frankly, no idea. Absolutely no idea and it infuriates me.

Michelle Grattan:

I can feel that. You never enjoy a latte?

Michael McCormack:

Oh look, I'm more of a cappuccino person myself, but I don't knock anybody for having a  latte. And so long as it’s provided with good dairy products from regional Australia then  that's fine.

Michelle Grattan:

Just broadening out of these jobs question, what do you think of suggestions that somehow  we should get more migrants into the regions, perhaps specifically more of the refugee  intake. Do you think that's desirable, feasible? Are regional people interested in that sort of  idea?

Michael McCormack:

Well when you've got control of your borders, as we have, you can actually provide  humanitarian assistance to countries where there is conflict and a humanitarian crisis just  like we've done with the Yazidis, 55 families have come to Wagga Wagga and you know  they've integrated in the community. They’ve fill jobs that that couldn't or wouldn't be filled  by locals.

Michelle Grattan:

This is your own electorate?

Michael McCormack:

This is my own electorate in the Riverina. Wagga Wagga is the capital of southern New  South Wales, in my Riverina electorate. So you know, that's been fantastic. Now I know the  Regional Australia Institute just recently announced its The Missing Workers report, a  fantastic report, and I commend Jack Archer and his team for putting that report out, for  trying to connect the dots as far as trying to connect migrants with jobs in regional areas. In  those regional areas, I have to stress, where we the communities are ready, willing and able  to take them; where there's the services, the health and education, and certainly the mental  health services available. But also bringing the migrants in as families, that's important  because if you just bring individuals - skilled or unskilled - the chances are they'll do the job,  they'll leave as quick as they can. But if you bring families in, they integrate in the  communities, the communities provide a safety net, people get involved in local sport, the  kids get involved with - you know they get friends at the school and it's a win-win for all  involved. It gives the migrants a new home, a new start, great energy and it gives the  regions which are already vibrant but it gives them another opportunity to give these  people employment.

Michelle Grattan:

So how does it work in Wagga? Are there special services for these families or do  community groups adopt them?

Michael McCormack:

All of that. All of that. Local community groups. We've got fantastic refugee advocate  support groups. WARFICA, Wagga Africa, they're a fantastic group and we've got other  support networks for people from all over the world and you know it's also very caring  compassionate community Wagga Wagga and I'm proud to represent it. It’s not just Wagga  Wagga in the Riverina, I know other communities in the Riverina, Leeton has also thrown

open its arms to say please come to us. I’ve had Jenny Clark the former Narrandera mayor  who is still on the council from Narrandera rang me on Sunday to extol the virtues of getting  more migrants in that fantastic community. It used to be at the heart of the Riverina, now  it’s in the Farrer electorate, more's the pity I love Narrandera, it's a fantastic community but  it is welcome and open to more migrants coming there and Jenny Clark's spirit of saying  please come is sort of emblematic of what the community is saying.

Michelle Grattan:

Now just looking to the next election. The Nationals in 2016 ran a very different campaign to  the Liberals and were very successful holding their seats by doing that. Will you...

Michael McCormack:

And adding one. We added the seat of Murray and Damian Drum came on board and he's  making a fantastic contribution.

Michelle Grattan:

From a Liberal. Will this be the case again? Will you have a very distinct campaign?

Michael McCormack:

Well look, we will weigh that up at the time. We've got a great budget to sell, a great  message to tell and, you know, we are very much in unison with the Liberal Party about all  the great economic blueprint that we've- plans that we've got in place. But at the end of the  day National Party people tend to be very grassroots. They tend to be very focused on their  local communities and all politics is local.

Now we ran a very good local campaign but, you know, National Party members aren’t just  going to campaign when the 33 day election period gets called. We're out there  campaigning now. We're out there turning up to events, listening to people and what they  are saying, their expectations and demands and wants and needs, but we do that all the  time as a matter of course because we’re good local representatives and whether you're the  Deputy Prime Minister or whether you're a backbencher in The National Party the  expectation is that you will work, you’ll work hard day and night, on weekends and make  sure that you're listening and in tune with your community.

Michelle Grattan:

How much of a threat do you see Pauline Hanson being to you next time, more or less than  past?

10



Michael McCormack:

Well, you know, anybody who's going to take a vote from an LNP member, particularly I  suppose in my case a National Party member is a threat and I think Bill Shorten poses the  greatest threat to Australia in the way the fabric of society that we've come to expect. I  mean even the attack on Australia Day 26 January being a day of acknowledgement, of what  we've always done in the past. But there's so many things that, you know, our way of life,   our standard of living, our cost of living, they are under threat from Bill Shorten and Labor   and the Greens - and Pauline Hanson obviously. You know, Pauline Hanson's One Nation  Party represents a threat because who knows where her preferences might flow.   We've seen in the recent Queensland state election that some sitting members were  unseated because the preferences went to Labor and now we've got the Annastacia   Palaszczuk government back again and not doing a particularly good job. And so we need to  make sure that we continue to sell our good budget message and to be in our own local  communities fighting hard for local needs and expectations.

Michelle Grattan:

Just specifically on Hanson, however, do you think she’s peaked?

Michael McCormack:

Well that'll be a matter for the electorate. That will be a matter of for the constituents. But I  think they will view what we've done and how we're doing it very favourably. Good budget,  good local members fighting hard - and with a backbencher, an Assistant Minister, a  Minister around, they have influence on government decisions and outcomes and delivery.   Pauline Hanson does not offer that.

Michelle Grattan:

Now some might say that you as leader of The Nationals are likely to give it a less distinct  image than did Barnaby Joyce. Do you want to reshape the party or reposition the party in  any sense? And do you see any danger in being portrayed as perhaps a bit more of a  pushover for Malcolm Turnbull than Barnaby was?

Michael McCormack:

Trust me I am no pushover for anybody and I am my own individual person. I'm not Barnaby  Joyce. I'm not Warren Truss, I'm not John Anderson. I’m Michael McCormack and I  think  anybody who knows me knows when I cross the floor on the Murray Darling Basin knows  that I put the interests of regional Australia and certainly those people in the Riverina first

11

and foremost and did it with a smile on my face, did it with a determination in my eye. They  know that, you know, I come to this job very determined. I’m somebody who you would  underestimate at your peril. Malcolm knows that I'm a very serious player in this political  landscape in Canberra and...

Michelle Grattan:

Have you had any blues yet?

Michael McCormack:

Malcolm and I get on very well. We get on very well. But look I've got an electorate to  represent. I've got constituency regional Australia who, you know, in some of the league  tables they don't fare very well. And I and my National Party team will be in there fighting  hard for them every step of the way. Each and every waking moment of every day we will be  in there fighting for them and I will be leading the National Party and doing just that. And if  you already look at what I've been able to deliver a Murray Darling network of medical  schools, that hasn't been achieved by others. It was achieved under my leadership and with  the assistance of Bridget McKenzie my Deputy Leader and a Minister for Rural Health among  other things. So we've delivered that. And adding a voice for Tasmania in The National Party.  The first senator that The National Party’s ever had in the Apple Isle, that’s been delivered  by me too and he came to The National Party because he liked what he saw in the  leadership and he liked the stability of our party and he saw us as a natural fit for him. We  saw him as a natural fit for us. I achieved that. No other National Party leader has been able  to achieve that I have to say and, you know, we've tried. Look you can put it down to a bit of  good luck but you can also put it down to a lot of good management and I'm proud to say  that Steve Martin is going to make a big contribution to our party going forward and I'm  delighted that we've now got another state into our big happy unified hardworking National  Party family.

Michelle Grattan:

Just on that who made the first approach?

Michael McCormack:

Steve came to me and we had a series of very cordial meetings but, you know, we talked the  business, we discussed how we could fit in with each other and what we could both bring to  the table for each other and no deals done. He liked what he saw. He liked the leadership.  He liked the stability of our party. He liked the fact that we’re a voice for regional Australia  and he signed on the dotted line. Good luck to him and we'll put a structure in and around  him now and we will from little big things grow.
