ALAN JONES:

The Opposition Leader Tony Abbott is with me in the studio. Tony, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

There are headlines today about the National Audit Office report into the $800 million Regional and Local  Community Infrastructure Programme, and the Audit Office has found there have been major delays, and  they didnÃ¢ÂÂt contribute to stimulus, and so on. But tied up with all of this is the announcement yesterday by  the Prime Minister of $1 billion in new projects, and New South Wales miss out again. $6.3 million to New  South Wales. Now, Nathan Rees took a 500 page submission to Infrastructure Australia when he was the  Premier, and all they got out of it was $91 million and Melbourne got $3.6 billion. What the hell is  happening, and what are you going to do to restore the imbalance?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Alan, I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt that the federal Labor Government is very embarrassed about the state  Labor Government, and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt want to have any association with it. They think that the state Labor  Government is toxic, and they donÃ¢ÂÂt want guilt by association. The important thing, Alan, is that all  Australians get a fair go from the federal government, and I would do my best to ensure that that happens.  But, I do have to say that what we have seen from this federal Labor Government often does look like  bailing out the incompetence of state Labor Governments.

ALAN JONES:

But, I mean, when you go down to Infrastructure Australia, and weÃ¢ÂÂre not talking about recurrent  expenditure here, weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about capital expenditure, you go down there as Nathan Rees went with 500

2

pages of representations as to what New South Wales and western Sydney need, and get absolutely nothing  out of it. How do you, how do you reassure the people in western Sydney that theyÃ¢ÂÂll a better hearing than  this if you become Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I accept that it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem fair the way the current federal Labor Government has treated the  people of New South Wales. But, IÃ¢ÂÂm not part of the Infrastructure Australia process, and I havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen the  submissions that the state Government has brought. This is part of the internal working of the federal and  state Labor Governments, and I mean, I agree with you, Alan, the outcome doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem good. It seems very  unfair for the people of New South Wales. But IÃ¢ÂÂm not really in a position to say about the quality of the  documentation.

ALAN JONES:

But, I mean, the front page of The Daily Telegraph today says Ã¢ÂÂNew South Wales youÃ¢ÂÂre a dud,Ã¢ÂÂ so if the  federal Government doesnÃ¢ÂÂt want anything to do with the people of New South Wales, why should those  people be voting for that federal Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a very good point. And, obviously, the people of New South Wales have a lot of experience of  just how bad these Labor Governments can get. And one of the points that IÃ¢ÂÂve been making over the last  month or so, Alan, is that New South Wales Labor style, execute a Premier because of dips in the opinion  polls, has now come to Canberra. I mean, Kevin Rudd got the Nathan Rees treatment. Kevin Rudd got the  Morris Iemma treatment, and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think this is good for democracy. I donÃ¢ÂÂt think this is good for our  polity to have the Sussex Street hit-squad stalking Canberra the way theyÃ¢ÂÂve stalked Macquarie Street.”

ALAN JONES:

Another headline today says that Julia Gillard privately argued against two of the Rudd GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs major  increases in welfare payments, itÃ¢ÂÂs claimed that while she was happy to share credit for the decisions to give  more cash for aged pensions and parental leave, in the inner sanctum of government she tried to cut the size  of the pension increase and kill off the parental leave scheme. And sheÃ¢ÂÂs reportedly told colleagues the  parental leave scheme was being pursued because it was Ã¢ÂÂpolitically correctÃ¢ÂÂ and that the pension rise was  excessive because Ã¢ÂÂold people never vote for us.Ã¢ÂÂ

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, Alan, I guess a couple of points here. I mean, the first point is that itÃ¢ÂÂs often hard to know what  the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs deeper political convictions are. And the second point is that I just think that there is  some terrible malaise at the heart of this Government when youÃ¢ÂÂve got this kind of leaking going on.  Obviously senior people inside the Labor Party are now working against the Prime Minister, and if the  Government is re-elected it will be a very divided, very unhappy government. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to be  good for our country. She canÃ¢ÂÂt say who the defence minister is going to be post-election, she canÃ¢ÂÂt say who  the finance minister is going to be post-election. We donÃ¢ÂÂt know whether sheÃ¢ÂÂs promised the foreign  ministry to Kevin Rudd. On some accounts she has, thatÃ¢ÂÂs hardly good for Stephen SmithÃ¢ÂÂs position, so  weÃ¢ÂÂve got a Prime Minister whose fundamental political convictions are far from clear, and we have an  extremely divided Government.

ALAN JONES:

Julia Gillard made a speech yesterday to the Australian Manufacturing Union in Brisbane in which she said  Tony Abbott Ã¢ÂÂis running from the policies heÃ¢ÂÂs pursued throughout his public life, he plans to cut essential  services, to cut funding for education, and to cut support for Australian manufacturing and jobs.Ã¢ÂÂ

TONY ABBOTT:

I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a bit of pre-election smearing going on. For instance, last week up in Brisbane, Alan, I  announced $760 million on an expanded Education Tax Rebate, so thatÃ¢ÂÂs an extra $760 million that will go  towards the education expenses of parents. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs certainly not a cut to education. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a benefit to education.  Now, yes, I do think that wasteful programmes should be stopped, and the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs computers in  schools programme is a wasteful programme. She said sheÃ¢ÂÂd give a million computers to schools by, I think,  2012. So far weÃ¢ÂÂve got about 300,000 of those computers out there. These kids will have left university  before JuliaÃ¢ÂÂs computers turn up. LetÃ¢ÂÂs face it, there are, there have got to be more efficient ways of doing  things than this, and so yes we will cut that programme. And with the Education Revolution Programme the  money must go to the school communities, to the parents and to the principals because they wonÃ¢ÂÂt waste it  the way the state bureaucracy has. So some of the money we will be spending differently, but in many areas  weÃ¢ÂÂll be putting more money into education.

ALAN JONES:

Wayne Swan was talking about you increasing company tax, and calling it the “Woolies and Coles tax”.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, again, I think this just shows the potency of the CoalitionÃ¢ÂÂs attack on the great big new taxes that the  Labor Party is already committed to. Now, the mining tax is obviously the one thatÃ¢ÂÂs been front and centre,  this will do extraordinary damage to our most successful industry. Investment will dry up, jobs will dry up,  and everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs prosperity will be harmed. The interesting thing about the mining industry, Alan, is lots of  places that donÃ¢ÂÂt have any mines do have a mining industry. I mean, half the suburbs of Sydney have  workshops and companies there that are servicing the mining industry, even though there are no mines in  those suburbs. All of these industries can be hurt by this mining tax. And then thereÃ¢ÂÂs the carbon tax. I notice  that on your programme yesterday, Alan, the Prime Minister didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to talk about the Green preference  deal, kept saying Ã¢ÂÂitÃ¢ÂÂs something that was done at the organisational level.Ã¢ÂÂ Preferences donÃ¢ÂÂt come for free.  The Labor Party must have agreed to do something in order to get these Green preferences. The Prime  Minister wants a carbon price, the Greens want a carbon tax, I think this citizensÃ¢ÂÂ assembly is just a  smokescreen for the coming carbon tax, which will hit our economy for six. A $40 a tonne carbon tax would  double the price of electricity, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs on top of the 35 per cent increase in electricity prices weÃ¢ÂÂve had  over the last three years.

ALAN JONES:

Coal-fired electricity, weÃ¢ÂÂve got to get to the guts of it, havenÃ¢ÂÂt we. I mean, the Greens want to knock off  coal-fired electricity which provides 80 per cent of our electricity. It provides the competitive advantage that  we enjoy in international trading. It provides the source of our wealth. Now, if this carbon tax or any kind of  tax of that kind is going to limit investment in those electricity stations, or if banks wonÃ¢ÂÂt lend as a result of  the carbon tax, what does that mean in terms of cost of living to Australians?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what it means, Alan, is that prices will go up, inevitably, but it also means that investment will go  down. And that means that the reliability of supply over time becomes much less certain. So, the problem  with all of this is that the Government needs these taxes because its spending is out of control. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs  why I keep saying, Alan, that the fundamental task of government right now, certainly the task that will be  most pressing on day one of an incoming Coalition governmentÃ¢ÂÂs life, is to get debt and deficit under

4

control. And the greatest indictment of this Government is the fact that you cannot trust it with your  taxpayer dollar. I mean, the pink batts programme, the school hall rip-offs which the Prime Minister was  personally supervising. YouÃ¢ÂÂve just mentioned the cash for clunkers, well, I mean, this could easily turn out  to be pink batts for cars. I mean, they just donÃ¢ÂÂt know how to manage money. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs the biggest  problem theyÃ¢ÂÂve got.

ALAN JONES:

Much is being made of this health statement yesterday about GP super clinics, if weÃ¢ÂÂre talking health care.  Now, I spoke with a private sector outfit this week. They asked to see me. And theyÃ¢ÂÂre already providing GP  clinics. And, is this another case of the public sector doing things with taxpayerÃ¢ÂÂs money, which the private  sector is doing, and doing them worse? If I could just amplify my point, there are only four of the  GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs GP super clinics in place. The Government promised 31, and that promise has been ramped  up. But the outfit I spoke to the day before yesterday has already opened 21 large GP clinics, at an average  cost of $3.1 million per clinic. The budget papers show the Government super clinics at an average cost of  $5.91 million. The private sector clinics bulk bill, the super clinics, the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs clinics, donÃ¢ÂÂt. The  private sector provides after hours services, the super clinics donÃ¢ÂÂt. And Julia Gillard announced Ã¢ÂÂwell, we  will now have an after hour call centre,Ã¢ÂÂ another $400 million. YouÃ¢ÂÂre talking about waste. How the hell can  we afford this stuff when the private sector is already doing it?

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very good point, Alan, and prior to the last election when I was the health minister I said these GP  super clinics would not work, and that they were unnecessary because doctors are already doing this kind of  thing. I have visited many, many super clinics in my time as health minister, and they were GPs,  pharmacists, physiotherapists, x-ray providers, and so on. All on the one site, all happening through the  operation of our managed market under Medicare. You do not need to set up these inefficient government  clinics in competition with existing or planned effectively super clinics that have been put up by the private  sector.

ALAN JONES:

And itÃ¢ÂÂs the Building the Education Revolution again. The private sector is building them at half the price of  the public sector and this is taxpayerÃ¢ÂÂs money.

TONY ABBOTT:

YouÃ¢ÂÂre absolutely right. See, theyÃ¢ÂÂre peddling something which is fundamentally misleading, the idea that  unless the Government does it, it wonÃ¢ÂÂt happen. Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs happening out there already. It has been  happening for years. If the government comes in and does it, a) it wonÃ¢ÂÂt do it well, and b) it will do it in  competition with people who are already doing it, and they donÃ¢ÂÂt need an extra subsidy to do it.

ALAN JONES:

And the people already doing it are providing dental care, physios, pediatrists, psychologists, which the so-called super clinics donÃ¢ÂÂt provide at all.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right, look down at Brookvale in my electorate there has been a super clinic operating for about  20 years. It is an excellent service, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the allied health professionals, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the doctors, youÃ¢ÂÂve  got the pharmacy, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the radiology, all on the one side, itÃ¢ÂÂs open until, I think, midnight, every  night, starts at five oÃ¢ÂÂclock in the morning, so that is…

5

ALAN JONES:

So itÃ¢ÂÂs a waste of taxpayerÃ¢ÂÂs money.

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course itÃ¢ÂÂs a waste of taxpayerÃ¢ÂÂs money.

ALAN JONES:

Look, you spoke yesterday about calling off this declaration of restrictions in relation to fishing zones on the  coast of Australia. Now, it mightnÃ¢ÂÂt have seemed much, but peopleÃ¢ÂÂs livelihoods are at stake, just a quick  comment on that because I want to take you to another aspect of it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, well, look. Every - the whole of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs coastal waters, Alan, are at risk of these marine  protection area declarations and what that could mean is no fishing whatsoever. Now, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt always  mean that, but whatÃ¢ÂÂs been happening under the current Government is there has been no real consultation  with the people whose livelihoods are affected. So, we will suspend the process and start it again with proper  consultation with these people because you canÃ¢ÂÂt just be caviller with peopleÃ¢ÂÂs economic futures and thatÃ¢ÂÂs  what this GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs been.

ALAN JONES:

Ok, well, being caviller with peopleÃ¢ÂÂs economic futures. You may not be aware, but the Department of  Climate Change has been sending directions to councils to undergo assessments based on departmental  criteria about the impact of rising sea levels, youÃ¢ÂÂre aware of all the alarmist talk about this. People have  written to me who live in Sylvania Waters, not far from where weÃ¢ÂÂre broadcasting but this is right up the  coast of Australia, and they say the Department of Climate Change is working on the theory that sea levels  will rise and figures have been put forward of between 80 centimetres and one metre. Now, these areas are  likely to be rezoned as flood affected, that means people have to pay more for their insurance and are,  premiums have already risen from $5,000, $50,000 people say theyÃ¢ÂÂll find it harder now to get mortgages in  these areas, property values will fall and the Government can even buy some of these poor cootes up, at a  reduced price and turn them into parks. As you did with the fishing zone, would you in Government call off  the dogs from the Department of Climate Change until all the facts in relation to this are put on the table?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Alan, look. IÃ¢ÂÂd certainly want to have a look at it before I make a commitment, but I do take your  point. There is no certainty whatsoever that sea levels are going to rise by anything like those amounts and  to suddenly start scaring the bejesus out of people and particularly damaging their investment is just not  right.

ALAN JONES:

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs happening now.

TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs just not right.

ALAN JONES:

6

And theyÃ¢ÂÂre wanting you to stop it.

TONY ABBOTT:   Well, IÃ¢ÂÂll have a look at it, Alan. I canÃ¢ÂÂt make a commitment here and now without studying it more closely,  but I can absolutely understand why people arenÃ¢ÂÂt happy because, as you say, their costs go up and worst of  all, I guess, the value of their investment falls. And itÃ¢ÂÂs quite speculative this idea that sea levels are going to  rise.

ALAN JONES:

People are very anxious about this issue…

TONY ABBOTT:

I absolutely do.

ALAN JONES:

So, if I get that material to you…

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course, yes.

ALAN JONES:

You, yesterday, itÃ¢ÂÂs 7:30 by the way, yesterday Julia Gillard (sic) and Scott Morrison met with the Foreign   Minister of Nauru, who publicly said heÃ¢ÂÂd take a phone call from the Government and they could reactivate  that processing centre. Now, on asylum seekers it seems as though the Government is unclear as to what itÃ¢ÂÂs  going to do. Is this because itÃ¢ÂÂs done a deal with the Greens and the Greens want open borders?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think on asylum seekers, what the Government wants to do is to con people that itÃ¢ÂÂs got a solution,  when it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt. This East Timorese offshore processing centre will never, ever happen. It is a complete  political mirage. The Indonesians donÃ¢ÂÂt like it and the East Timorese wonÃ¢ÂÂt have it. It will never, ever  happen. And it was…

ALAN JONES:

But our climate change assembly will fix all this up, wonÃ¢ÂÂt it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I mean, this is a Government…

ALAN JONES:

I mean, is that a joke or is that fair dinkum?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a Government, Alan, which cannot make a decision on a hard issue and it pretends to have made

7

decisions on other issues. I mean, it pretended there was a decision to have a centre in East Timor, wrong.  There hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been on and there never will be one. On the other hand, it shirks the decision on what to do  about climate and as I said, the Prime Minister keeps talking about a carbon price and the need for it, the  Greens keep talking about a carbon price. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll get this, theyÃ¢ÂÂll keep this citizens assembly talking until it  comes up with the idea they want. And the idea they want is a carbon tax.

ALAN JONES:

Well, just back to asylum seeker people, I mean, basically, Nauru is ready. That, you say, is an acceptable  offshore processing centre, the Government promised, or the Opposition promised, Kevin Rudd, that he  would abolish temporary protection visas, he did. He said heÃ¢ÂÂd abolish the offshore processing, he did. And  the boats kept coming in. Now, the Daily Telegraph, I think last Saturday, ran a story that there could be an  armada of asylum seekers by the end of the year. How critical therefore is it to act immediately to send the  appropriate message or as Indonesia called it, to take the sugar off the table?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely vital, Alan. And we, the Australian taxpayers, built the centre in Nauru, itÃ¢ÂÂs already   there, with our money. So surely, the smart thing to do is to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru  today and say, look, how soon can it be open again? And our advice is that it can be open again within  weeks. This East Timorese mirage would cost tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars, even it the East  Timorese would have it. But weÃ¢ÂÂve already spent the money in Nauru, so why waste money, building the  same thing, somewhere else?

ALAN JONES:

I just should say by way of comment here that youÃ¢ÂÂll notice on a couple of occasions when I ask Tony  Abbott for an opinion, he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily give the answer the populist answer that people would want. I  particularly ask, for example, about the climate change issues in relation to people owning coastal  properties. He said heÃ¢ÂÂd assess the facts. Now, as you know, at the last election, the Opposition were quick  to promise the Heavens, the Earth and the moon and delivered on none of it. When you assess the facts, the  other issue, and I say that because the other issue IÃ¢ÂÂve had a lot of correspondence about and I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt aware  until yesterday that you obviously have as well, is this question of new rules requiring child care providers  to hire more teachers with better qualifications. Now, you have obviously analysed all the material thatÃ¢ÂÂs  been sent in and you have promised to delay the introduction of these new rules, saying they would spark fee  increases for parents. I have been inundated on this issue. Just amplify that, if you would.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, sure, Alan. Look, COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, has agreed that in a couple of years  time, new rules will become mandatory that will dramatically raise the cost of child care. YouÃ¢ÂÂll have to  have a much higher staff to child ratio and youÃ¢ÂÂll have to have more highly qualified people on site,  depending upon the age of the children. Now, all of us want to see high quality childcare so thatÃ¢ÂÂs a given.  But it all comes with a price tag and just saying, arenÃ¢ÂÂt we fantastic, weÃ¢ÂÂve given you higher quality price  tag, without also looking at the funding implications and the cost implications, is silly, so weÃ¢ÂÂre going to…

ALAN JONES:

The unions are saying youÃ¢ÂÂre threatening the quality of childcare.

TONY ABBOTT:

8

We are trying to ensure that we go forward in a sensible, affordable way, so weÃ¢ÂÂre going to re-open the  consultations with the sector and make sure that the cost implications of all of this have been properly  considered before we go down this path.

ALAN JONES:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂm seeking from you in relation to the Department of Climate Change, if you would re-open  these assessments that the department is making about the impact of rising sea levels.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. Look, if there is a real danger, obviously, it has to be addressed, but if this is just some  bureaucrat covering his or her backside and making ordinary people suffer, so we can say weÃ¢ÂÂve done  something about climate change, well then itÃ¢ÂÂs no good.

ALAN JONES:

Absolutely. Just one final thing. Until we talk next week, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a massive infrastructure deficit in this  country. And youÃ¢ÂÂre a bloke with scholarship and the ability to think outside the square. Why wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt you  call for, in Government, a panel of experts to look at the idea of issuing infrastructure bonds, which you  could invent superannuation funds to invest in and the private sector, with a view to mounting a massive  assault on the infrastructure backlog, whether is was harvesting water, transporting water, perhaps a very  fast train. That has to be addressed, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt it?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is something that we are looking at, Alan. We havenÃ¢ÂÂt made a decision on it, we havenÃ¢ÂÂt announced a  policy on it. But certainly, infrastructure bonds have been used previously in this country. They were in  place in the late nineties and quite a number of significant projects around here were funded, in part, with  those infrastructure bonds.

ALAN JONES:

But doesnÃ¢ÂÂt it involve government not picking winners that allows the private sector to make these  decisions?

TONY ABBOTT:

It does add an element of creativity into the system, thatÃ¢ÂÂs itÃ¢ÂÂs strength, in a way that government simply  making the decision and awarding a subsidy on a kind of bureaucratic basis doesnÃ¢ÂÂt, so I take your point,  there is a lot to be said for them. IÃ¢ÂÂm not saying weÃ¢ÂÂve made a commitment to them yet, Alan, but weÃ¢ÂÂre  certainly looking at it.

ALAN JONES:

Ok, good to talk to you and weÃ¢ÂÂll talk next week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Alan.
