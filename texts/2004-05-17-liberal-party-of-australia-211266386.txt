Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND  INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

Media Centre Further Decisions Handed Down on Nauru VPS 73/2004

Seventy-seven Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru have been granted refugee status over the weekend,  Minister for Immigration and Indigenous and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, announced today.

'These weekend decisions follow my announcement last Friday of the first decisions being handed down  on Nauru as a result of the re-examination of asylum seeker cases,' Senator Vanstone said.

'Over the weekend, 77 Afghan asylum seekers have been granted refugee status and it has been decided  that eight do not need refugee protection.

'On Friday I announced that fifteen Afghan asylum seekers had been granted refugee protected and three  had not.'

'There are a total of 180 Afghan asylum seekers, or people claiming to be Afghans, in the Australian  caseload on Nauru. Further decisions affecting the remainder will be handed down in the near future.'

Senator Vanstone said these latest decisions were in keeping with the Government's commitment made  late last year, to reassess the cases of Afghan asylum seekers as a result of changed conditions in  Afghanistan, incorporating information provided by the UNHCR.

'All those who have been granted refugee protection will continue to receive support including  accommodation, food, clothing and medical care, while arrangements are made to resettle them,' Minister  Vanstone said.

'Most will be offered resettlement in Australia.

'Australia has made it clear all along that it will take its fair share of refugees needing resettlement from  the offshore processing centres and this announcement confirms the Australian Government's  commitment to that.'
