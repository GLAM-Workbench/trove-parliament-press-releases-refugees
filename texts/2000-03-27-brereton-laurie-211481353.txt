Refugee Situation In West Timor

Laurie Brereton - Shadow Minister For Foreign Affairs

Media Statement - 27 March 2000

Â

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie 
Brereton, today expressed concern at the potential for a major humanitarian 
crisis in West Timor and renewed Labor's calls for the Australian Government 
to boost assistance to East Timorese refugees remaining in the province.

Â

"The imminent cessation of assistance by 
the Indonesian Government to the estimated 100,000 East Timorese refugees 
in West Timor has the potential to generate a serious humanitarian crisis", 
Mr Brereton said.

Â

Today's Jakarta Post newspaper reports a looming 
crisis as the 31 March cut-off for Indonesian Government support to 
the East Timorese refugees approaches.

Â

"Notwithstanding the Indonesian Government's 
assurances of 'necessary flexibility' in dealing with the refugees, 
the 31 March deadline has the potential to generate a humanitarian crisis 
in West Timor and instability across the border in East Timor", 
Mr Brereton said.

Â

"More than 530 refugees are reported to 
have died of preventable diseases in refugee camps in West Timor over 
the past six months. In the absence of an increased international aid 
effort, there is clearly the potential for further deaths."

Â

"The Australian Government allocated $3 
million last December to meet emergency health needs of refugees in 
West Timor. While this was an appropriate initial contribution, deteriorating 
health conditions and deaths make it essential for Australia to provide 
further medical and other assistance and to do so without delay."

Â

"Indonesia presently faces enormous humanitarian 
challenges including those arising from the religious violence in the 
Maluku Islands. Labor has repeatedly called for Australia to be generous 
in helping Indonesia alleviate the consequences of such conflicts."

Â

"In mid January Labor called on the Howard 
Government to boost humanitarian assistance to West Timor. Two and a 
half months later, no further assistance has been forthcoming. It is 
vital the Howard Government delay no longer."
