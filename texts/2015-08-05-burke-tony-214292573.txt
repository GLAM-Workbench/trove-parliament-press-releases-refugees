THE HON TONY BURKE MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FINANCE  MANAGER OF OPPOSITION BUSINESS  MEMBER FOR WATSON

STATEMENT



I refer to reports in today’s News Limited papers.

My criticism of Bronwyn Bishop was that she had broken the rules.

Today’s articles explicitly acknowledge that there is no allegation that I have  broken any of the rules at any point.

The information provided in these articles is public because I made  declarations in accordance with the rules.

The rules for Members of Parliament are now subject to a review announced  by the Prime Minister and supported by Labor.
