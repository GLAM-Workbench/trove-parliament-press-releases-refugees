Migrant Settlement Councils  Congratulated .

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr Ian Macphee today congratulated the chairmen of Australia's

eight Migrant Settlement Councils on the success of the

Community Refugee Settlement Scheme.

He was speaking at the second annual conference of

Migrant Settlement Council chairmen.  Migrant Settlement Councils

are responsible for oversighting and advising the Minister for

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on the initial settlement of

migrants, including refugees.

The Community Refugee Settlement Scheme was announced

by the previous Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr Michael MacKeLlar late last year. It was designed to move

groups of refugees directly into the community.

"Migrant Settlement Councils have contributed a great

deal to the promotion and development of the Community Refugee

Settlement Scheme," said Mr Macphee. "The membership of the

Councils, which are made up of people from Commonwealth and State

Government Departments,  ethnic and community groups and voluntary

agencies,  ideally suits them for this role."

The Minister said that applications involving nearly

700 refugees had already been accepted. These refugees were

being settled in thirty separate localities throughout Australia.

The Minister and Chairman also discussed a range of

other matters concerned with migrant and refugee settlement.

Of particular interest was proposals to establish in the

coming months, community based migrant settlement centres

to cater for the needs of migrants who move directly into

the community.
