BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, firstly, can I say this is a product of now 
some near six months work by a sub-committee of the Shadow Cabinet which 
we set up shortly after the last election to look at the total problem 
of illicit drugs in Australia. The individual members of that sub-committee 
have been, including myself, have been taking the opportunity to get 
out and about and talk to people, particularly those involved in rehabilitation 
and detoxification programs to see where the answers may lie in what 
is becoming a major, or what is a major, national affliction. And this 
paper is now released. It’s a White Paper, a working paper. The paper 
is now released in the context of the time for the States and Federal 
Drugs Summit at the end of this week in the hope that there are a few 
ideas here that they may want to take up. It’s released in a bipartisan 
spirit. Nobody’s got a monopoly of knowledge and rightness in this 
particular area because it’s a battle that involves the whole community.

Â

So, I can summarise what is, in fact, quite a complex, 
detailed, across-the-board project to say this has three essential elements 
to it. Firstly, there needs to be good national approach. The national 
drugs strategy defined previously had its day, did reasonably well at 
the time but is now insubstantial and unfocused. We need a national 
coordination unit to pick out the best of what has been done at the 
national and State level and making it universal across Australia.

Â

We need a national approach. We need an approach to 
the profiteers from illicit drugs which says this: your castle is no 
longer yours, it’s the public’s castle. You will be deprived of 
all your assets that are a product of your illicit activities. You will 
not profit it; we will get you. In the end, we will get you. That’s 
one element of it.

Â

For those who are victims, for those who are addicted, 
there must be a 100 per cent commitment to keeping them alive. It is 
a dreadful thing that, for example in Victoria, the deaths from heroin 
overdoses at the moment now exceed the traffic deaths, exceed the road 
toll. This is a problem which must be got to grips with.

Â

Now, the answers are in no single area. There has 
to be good law enforcement. There has to be incentives for good law 
enforcement. There has to be the trialing of new diversion strategies 
like that of the Victorian Police which instead of jailing those who 
are addicted, try mechanisms for getting them into decent rehab programs. 
There has to be things like seed money across the continent for things 
like Bob Carr’s Drug Court which get people into a situation where 
instead of jailing them, and remember that some 60-odd per cent of what 
has been spent now in the criminal justice system is one way or another 
related to drug activities. We need to have things like that Drug Court.

Â

We also need good education programs, education programs 
which take the total social dimension of the life of folk who might 
be affected and we need to have response to things like good parenting, 
for example. We need to have education programs which are lifestyle 
based, focus not just on illicit drugs but also legal drugs as well 
that encourage people not to pursue those sorts of lifestyles. And we 
need funding, proper funding, for decent rehabilitation programs, including 
new ideas.

Â

Now, for example, here in Western Australia, we’ve 
got a very good program associated with the distribution of Naltrexone. 
What we need is proper scientific substantial programs across the nation 
related to use of Naltrexone and we need ... if it appears to be as 
successful as it appears likely to be we need it on the Pharmaceutical 
Benefits System (Scheme).

Â

We have an approach here which suggests a response 
to people’s rehabilitation and detoxification. We need to move it 
as much out of specialised clinics, and this includes the methadone 
program, as much out of specialised clinics as possible into the normal 
activities of community doctoring through your GP so that there is a 
ready access for people who are in some way addicted to proper treatment 
at a level that they’re used to experiencing that treatment, that 
is with their local GP.

Â

But one size won’t fit all. One size won’t fit all. There’d 
be some who respond to the sorts of offerings that I’ve been talking 
about. There are some who respond to other sorts of options.

Â

Now, I’ve reiterated views here that I’ve expressed in the past,  
for example, that we are opposed to heroin trials. And we need not to 
have rigid views, as far as that’s concerned. The jury’s out as 
far as those trials are concerned in Switzerland, for example. And if 
we balance it — law enforcement opinion and the balance of expert 
opinion suggests that that may be one of a number of solutions then 
we need to be open minded to be able to respond to that. But we don’t 
see a reason to respond to it at the moment but we keep an open mind 
on that.

Â

We also have a view that part of the process of keeping 
people who are addicted alive is to have effectively available to them 
ready assistance. So the heroin antidote, for example, Narcan, needs 
to be more readily available where a person is likely to be assisted 
if they’re suffering from overdoses. So, we need to think more innovatively 
about the availability of that. For example, to parents, if they happen 
to know that their children are addicted and may possibly require it, 
or to friends. Now, that is not to be in any way shape or form seen 
as approval of the taking of illicit drugs. It is part of understanding 
that we need to have an absolute commitment to keeping the addicted 
alive. Because there’s plenty of evidence to suggest if the addicted 
are kept alive sooner or later most will want to shake their addiction.

Â

So, that’s the battle — keep them alive and sooner 
or later they will come to the conclusion that they want to shake their 
addiction.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You’ve been down to George O’NeiI’s Naltrexone 
clinic. Is that what shaped your views on it?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Yes, it did. And I’ve seen ... But there are Naltrexone 
programs in the Eastern States but they’re very, very small. Not the 
size of George’s but George has got no help, or very, very little 
help and there needs to be proper funding for those programs.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

... $20 million ... money which was rejected by the States ...

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Yes, I am disappointed. You know, I think that we’ve 
all got to be involved in the battle and if somebody’s got a good 
idea and it’s working, and ... is working, ... it won’t work for 
everybody. I mean, anyone who insists that any particular program that 
is undertaken has to absolutely work for everybody, is a person who 
has described ... suggested that there shouldn’t be any programs at 
all. No single program is going to work for everybody. So, I mean, he’s 
entitled, I think, to a degree of support and he’s not getting it.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Am I right in understanding that you said that Narcan 
should be given to parents as a ....

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

We need to sit down and look at ... I just cited that 
as a possibility. But ...

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

I wonder how well thought out this program is ... 
policy ... if you’re suggesting that Narcan be given to parents ...

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

No, no, what I’m suggesting is that Narcan needs 
to be more generally available. And what we need to do is to get properly 
supervised programs associated with them and we need empowerment for 
families. In all these exercises we need empowerment to families. Now, 
I’m not suggesting that willy nilly it just go ... But all these sorts 
of things need to be thought about.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Narcan, as I understand it, is an intravenously ... 
drug ... medical ... paramedics and the like. You’re talking about 
increasing people’s knowledge to the point that they can intravenously 
...

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I’m talking about increasing the availability of 
it in a properly supervised way, not just a willy nilly way.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Police?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, to people who may be capable of assisting in 
regard to somebody at risk of an OD. It’s a very difficult thing to 
do because you’ve got to have the balance between the requirements 
of law enforcement and the commitment to dealing with people who are 
addicted in a harm minimisation program. And at the moment it is so 
narrowly based that if the availability of it is so narrowly based that 
it is not ... one of the number of responses it is too narrow. So, you 
know, you wouldn’t give it to anyone who couldn’t safely handle 
it. You wouldn’t do that. But what you have to do is to broaden its 
availability.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You’ve delivered a policy on ... policy on illicit 
drugs and you’ve thrown this one out on to the table but you’re 
not sure about what’s

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Take a lot at the totality of that program. What we’re putting up 
is a White Paper. What we’re  putting up is a series of suggestions 
and the directions in which the Government must go, or should contemplate 
going. For example, on that particular issue, what we’re talking about 
is properly training people who may be in a position to provide assistance 
with somebody they know is at risk. And at the moment people are dying 
because they don’t get access to it quickly enough.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

The other thing ... you also ... It doesn’t ... 
make mention of the most widely used illicit drug, marijuana. What do 
you say about the ALP’s policy on marijuana? Are you taking a softer 
line on it by not mentioning it?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

No. What we’re saying here is that we have major 
problems associated with heroin and opiates. And the focus here is on 
what’s killing people. That’s what the focus is. And I think you’ll 
find the focus of the Summit’s on what’s killing people and where 
the massive profits lie. And so what we are doing is focussing on what 
the main game is at the moment. Each country seems to have a different 
problem. In the United States it’s cocaine. In this country it happens 
to be the opiates - in particular, heroin.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

How much are you ...

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, I think that looking at the legal protections 
which are now currently enjoyed by those who are associated with the 
major distribution, we have got to start to change some of that. Now, 
of course, you’d want to protect people’s basic rights when they 
are themselves subject to trial. But there is no doubt about it at all 
that there are a large number of people who are aware of who’s profiting 
and who are the people basically responsible for this who are hiding 
behind various legal protections associated with it. And we would want 
to start to tease that out. Now, there are a number of ways of teasing 
it out but starting to impose more obligations on those who would have 
knowledge is one of the ways of doing it. So, I think it’s a pretty 
fair guess that there are an awful lot of accountants who know darn 
well where those resources are coming from for some of their clients. 
And in the same way as there are now obligations on banks, well, more 
and more obligations on banks associated with that, there should be 
those on them as well.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

The national... State borders... wouldn’t coastline 
be more effective?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, that’s also there. And there is a proposal 
there for it to become a national task associated with our Defence Forces. 
See, the National Security Council in the United States already has 
this as one of the identified threats to the United States and that 
channels down an appropriate response from their defence agencies. We 
don’t quite have that yet here.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You’re pushing for a greater defence involvement

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Yes, that’s been incorporated within this as well.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

There is a State Parliamentary Committee which brought 
down, which two ALP Members of Parliament are on, it’s brought down 
findings that in relation to the confiscation of proceeds of crime, 
that the authorities should be empowered to confiscate the proceeds 
of crime based merely on suspicion. Would you support that?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, that is actually in place in NSW at the moment 
- a well-founded suspicion and

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Suspicion and actual proof.

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, what we’re saying is balance of probabilities. 
That’s what we’re saying in the proposition here.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

... happy to take it to court to

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, we have to take it to court in order to be able 
to establish the balance of probabilities to get hold of the assets.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You’d have a court decide. I mean, you would take 
a case to court.

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

You’d take that process through the courts, yes. 
And that would not necessarily imply you’ve actually convicted someone. 
But that particular case that you’d take through the courts. I think 
that the people who are the profiteers need to be well and truly roughed 
up via this process, legally roughed up, and their ability to build 
their castles needs to be whipped away from them. Now, these are the 
mechanisms which you can do but you’ve also got to give the policy, 
or enforcement agencies, the reward for it. The Government made a fundamental 
mistake when it decided that the proceeds of crime materials ought to 
go to consolidated revenue. They need to change that. They need to walk 
back from that. And the proceeds of crime ought to be passed over to 
the law enforcement agencies and the rehab agencies but not as a substitute 
for proper funding, but on top of proper funding.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

... make mention of it, you quote the Victorian experience, 
or some of the Victorian remedies, some of the NSW remedies. What’s 
your view of Western Australia’s approach to it? I’m not suggesting 
they’re not doing anything but it seems that their whole theory is 
based in just the same

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I don’t think it’s a viable proposition. I think 
if you’re going down the road of harm minimisation you actually have 
to acknowledge the fact that a large number of people who experiment 
with these substances, and they’ll do it for a multiplicity of reasons, 
some of the time it’ll be peer pressure, some time it’ll be low 
self esteem. Some time it will be a product of difficult family backgrounds, 
difficult social life. You cannot turn a blind eye to the realities. 
Now, that is not to say that you should legalise the substances. You 
shouldn’t. But it is to say that when you come down to law enforcement, 
your approach has to be directed at those who are profiteering and when 
it comes to those who are individual users, accept the multiplicity 
of factors that are involved there and to deal with them via your education 
programs and also your responses for those who have become, effectively, 
addicted. If you are principally motivated by what is effectively a 
political stance, and not by a harm minimisation stance, the problem 
will simply go on. If you’re motivated by a harm minimisation stance, 
what I said — 100 per cent commitment to keeping those who are users 
alive - then you will start to develop appropriate law enforcement responses, 
as far as the victims are concerned.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You mentioned safe injecting rooms, too, Mr Beazley, 
and you reckon that ... State issue ...

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, I think it’s very hard. I mean, when you move 
from a de facto safe injecting room into an actual publicly supported 
safe injecting room all sorts of difficult legal problems emerge, there’s 
no question about that. Problems emerge in terms of having a focal point 
in your community that is an area which is a vortex in which an awful 
lot of illegal activity is drawn. And then you have responsibilities 
for those who utilise it. What is the level of State responsibility 
associated with minors? What is the level of State responsibility associated 
with overdoses? You’ve got all those sorts of problems associated 
with it. And what we’ve said in this paper is that this is for State 
and local authorities to nut out and think their way ...

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

.... Is that a cop out?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

No, it’s not really a cop out. It’s, in a sense, 
trying to help them by pointing to the sorts of problems that they have 
if they actually decide to go down the road of safe injecting rooms. 
And what we’re saying is that the Federal Government ought not to 
sit in judgement over it for some political reason or other. This is 
something that has to be worked out locally.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

inaudible

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

If they want to go ahead with it. But we point out 
to them the difficulties that they will experience which I’m sure 
is something they’ve already worked out for themselves.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

In this you also say the Australian Labor Party will 
not support the legalisation of illicit drugs. Is marijuana an illicit 
drug?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, it is an illicit drug, yes, and we don’t support 
the legalisation of it. But what we’re focussing in this paper is 
not on marijuana. What we’re focussing in this paper is on heroin 
and that will be the focus of the conference that takes place at the 
end of this week.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you believe marijuana is a gateway drug?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

From what I’m told, ... look, I’ve been going 
around talking to quite a few people involved in the business of looking 
after people who are associated and the minds of people who’ve got 
far more expertise than myself. There’s an ambience of family based 
drug taking, if you like, which produces a more likely person at risk. 
And that includes both licit and illicit drugs which are not talked 
about much in this paper. So, it includes cannabis. And that if there 
is a pattern of usage and particularly a pattern of abuse of alcohol 
and nicotine, marijuana, it is an ... in which a person is more likely 
to arrive at an opiate addiction. So, what we’re calling for in education 
programs is a total lifestyle approach to education associated with 
it. So, while I don’t have the expertise to say that it is a gateway 
drug, but having had a conversation with people who are actively involved 
in the processes of rehabilitation there is no doubt that if there is 
an ambience of abuse of legal and other illegal drugs, then the person 
who is within that ambience is more likely to find themselves with an 
opiate addiction.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you agree that there is a lot in common with the 
Premiers’ response to the drug problem and your paper?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, I hope so. I mean, I hope that there is the 
capacity to arrive at a bipartisan position on a lot of this. But I 
don’t think that slogans like ‘zero tolerance’, or whatever, are 
going to be particularly helpful. I think there has to be decent programs 
that take a broadly based approach and which, at the end of the day, 
treat a person who is a user as a victim. And if you’ve got that motivation 
then you’re likely in the end to arrive at something approaching correct 
solutions.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

What about drug prisons?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I don’t think that that’s necessarily going to...I 
don’t think that’s a particular solution. I mean, it’s there as 
a proposition. And if you look in this you do find strategies there 
associated with those who find themselves in prison for drug offences, 
to try and establish drug wings in things like prisons, that give people 
a chance to get out of it. But I think the that best thing to do for 
somebody who is drug addicted is to try and keep them out of gaol and 
try and keep them into programs which are likely to cure them. I think 
that’s the best approach.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

On heroin trials, you mentioned keeping an eye on 
developments overseas. But what if, say, a majority of States came to 
a view that they supported a heroin trial. Would you stand in their 
way?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

We would take a look at what the balance of opinion 
was amongst law enforcement officials and people with drug expertise. 
What we’ve said, we’ve got an open mind on that. At this stage of 
the game we don’t see for what we can see of the success or otherwise 
of heroin trials elsewhere - we don’t see a reason to change. But 
we’re prepared to take the view that this has now been subject to 
scientific testing and it’s been subject to argument amongst law enforcement 
officials and amongst those with drug expertise. And we don’t want 
to close our minds to that argument.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

The ACT has been prepared to have a go, one or two 
of the other States have supported the ACT. What if a few more come 
in?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, as I said, if their views have been based on 
a balance of opinion by law enforcement officials and those with a fair 
amount of expertise and on what they see is happening elsewhere we’re 
prepared to have a look at it. That’s also going to have to clear 
off a number of other problems, that is our international obligations 
related to it, which, if it’s a genuine scientific experiment you 
may be able to overcome. But we also want to see probably better results 
than the results that we’re getting out of Switzerland, for example, 
at the moment, which is not suggestive of a substantial number of people 
finding that as a mechanism for getting themselves unhooked at this 
stage of the game.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Is this an acceptable position, though, given that 
when you’re looking at a heroin trial it’s a trial. You’re not 
instigating heroin treatment programs. You’re looking at a trial to 
see if it’s worth pursuing or not. You’re not....

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Then you haven’t read the paper, which is understandable 
because you’ve not actually had much time to be able to do that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Well, I did read that paper, and it says you’ve 
got an open mind.

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

That’s not a bad start, is it? I think the point 
on this is that what we don’t want to do is become fixated on one 
particular solution. You see, there are solutions out there and they’re 
chronically underfunded. And there are new opportunities presenting 
themselves, like LAMM and Buprenorphine which take people off, run people 
down from, effectively a methadone addiction out to no addiction at 
all. And there’s Naltrexone which we know is a good treatment for 
alcoholism but which seems to be, on the basis of badly underfunded 
trials, seems to have a solution there as well. Now, we need to get 
proper funding going there. My objection, my concern with the focus 
that heroin trials have received so far is what we’re being presented 
with is a debate between zero tolerance and heroin trials. And that 
is a hopelessly pathetically inadequate debate. Then there are these 
chronically underfunded programs out there in the middle where people, 
despite that chronic underfunding, are enjoying successes. The object 
would suggest to you that you ought to be starting to get in behind 
those propositions as a mechanism for dealing with the totality of the 
problem.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

OK, what about figures, though funding for the Australian 
Federal Police and Coastwatch?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, it’s obviously going to have to be more than 
it is. What happened when this Government came into office is they slashed 
funds and then problems occurred. That’s not to say that if they hadn’t 
slashed funds the problems wouldn’t have occurred, they would have. 
We are subject now, and have been for the last two or three years, to 
a massive surge of importation, absolutely massive surge. And that would 
have overrun the Federal Police and the drug enforcement agencies even 
at the funding levels they were at before they were cut. The approach 
to the Federal Police needs to be a deal more sophisticated than it 
has been. If you look at the problems the Federal Police are confronting 
it’s not just the problem of underfunding, though that is there. It’s 
also a problem seniority, it’s a problem with training, it’s a problem 
of attracting people to stay in the service for a lengthy period of 
time. The Federal Police need a program that goes well beyond just simply 
funding a couple of drug enforcement task groups. And this needs to 
be done. That may be a long-term process. So, we say that in addition 
to that you’d have to have a range of other responses. And part of 
those responses would include things like more of a carrot, if you like, 
for the Federal Police and other drug enforcement agencies in getting 
to grips with the assets of those who are the drug pushers. You see, 
the problem at the moment with those who are the principal profiteers 
is they can get themselves gaoled for a period of time but their assets 
that they’ve built up are so enormous that it’s worth it. And now 
we’ve got to whip that out of their hands.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

How would you use, then, the defence forces?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

For surveillance, obviously, and interdiction at the 
border. And they do have some quite useful equipment in that regard. 
But they need it to be a specific defence task. Now it’s just a sort 
of general part of aid to the civil power, basically. It’s not part 
of the overall strategy, if you like, of the Australian defence forces, 
unlike those of the United States.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Will this policy be policy be presented at the Premiers’ ConferenceÂ

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

No, I’ll just send it around to my State colleagues. 
I doubt whether Bob Carr would do that, despite the fact that there’s 
ample praise in there for Bob’s drug courts. This will just go to 
them all, it’s been sent to them. And I hope it’s just a modest 
contribution to the ongoing debate. But I think you’ll find, as you 
read through, it’s a pretty comprehensive one.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Kosovo’s refugees, should they be sent to other 
countries or is that part of the internalÂ

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I think we need a generous hearted approach to this 
and I think the Australian Government does need to be prepared to give 
some consideration to any approaches that come to it. I note the preferences 
of the Kosovo refugees that they be kept as close to home as possible. 
The problem is the countries in those border areas can’t handle it 
and that’s the simple truth of the matter. And there’s going to 
have to be a response which at least in part incorporates the possibility 
that some of them will end up further from the border than they are 
at the moment.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

So should Australia be prepared to take on some of 
those refugees?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Yes, I think we should consider it if approached

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

How many?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Let’s see what…

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Five thousand?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Let’s see what the approach is.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

An approach from whom, from the United Nations, from 
the United States?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

From those who are actually handling the situation 
on the ground, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees would be one of 
them. NATO is obviously taking a look at how they ought to handle it 
themselves. We would not be anything remotely a big part of the solution 
to the problem but we took them in relation to Bosnia some years ago 
when a not dissimilar crisis arose in that area.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

But we also open our country up to people escaping 
the problem Tiananmen Square in quite considerable numbers. Do you see 
any anomaly of anything to reflect on if we don’t take refugees from 
Kosovo given what we did during the Tiananmen Square time?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I think we have developed a reputation of being sensible, 
balanced yet responsible when a situation of refugees has been created. 
If you take a sensible and balanced approach the likelihood is if you 
yourself confronted substantial problems others are going to be willing 
to help relieve you of those problems when those issues occur. And that 
was certainly our experience at the time in the late 70s when we had 
a surge of boat people to this country. The fact that we were prepared 
to take a certain number of refugees meant that other countries were 
prepared to act in a way that meant that we weren’t overwhelmed. Now, 
I think that’s a good thing to have occurred. But part of the quid 
pro quo of that is that in general we are part of the solution. So, 
we have a modestly generous approach when people themselves are experiencing 
difficulties like those currently being experienced in Kosovo. I would 
not expect that we would be approached for large numbers anyway arising 
out of this. I would not expect that. But there may be a bit of an attitude 
develop towards burden sharing and we should not be unresponsive to 
that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

So, the position is wait until the request comes?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Absolutely.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

And then take them?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

And then be prepared to have a response when that 
comes, yes.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

There are something like, I think Tiananmen was something 
like 100,000. Will it be as many as that?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

No, I don’t think so. I think it was about 25,000.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

A considerable number. You talk about us being part 
of the solution here but is that…. we’re not, are we, given that 
the Federal Government seems to have said, ‘look, we’re not going 
to take any we’ll be fine with those who are here, but we’re not 
really in the business of taking refugees from Kosovo’.

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

We’ve supported their approach to those who are 
here. We think that’s a sensible approach. And they note the fact 
that the way in which the UN and NATO are approaching the Kosovo refugees 
is the assumption they are temporary refugees and that the objective 
is that they should be allowed to return home. So, we note that anyone 
you took in would be on that sort of basis. But having established those 
two points, we also think that the Federal Government ought to look 
at this a little more generously.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You think they should loosen up immigration procedures?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, there are procedures in place for taking refugees. 
There are those...they don’t need to be changed. There’s just a 
question of whether or not you’re determined to apply those procedures 
to a particular group.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

....(inaudible)....

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

What I’ve already said is that we need to be open 
to them.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

....given about $2 million in humanitarian aid, is 
that adequate? If not, how much would you increase it by?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, the aid - $2 million — is good but we’re 
talking about a different dimension of problem now. We’re talking 
about the question of what happens to the people who are being deported, 
effectively, from Kosovo and we need to, as I said, be in a position 
to respond with modest generosity.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

As I understand it, I think the American strategy 
is to take the people and deal with them in Guam and in Cuba where they 
can put them into big camps and basically get a taste of the American 
lifestyle...they want to stay. Is there a place in Australia for doing 
that same sort of thing? Where they can pop them somewhere in a camp, 
look after them and then send them back when the time arrives?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I think that appropriate response is to look at this 
as a temporary problem. I think…. when you see the interviews that 
are done with the people who are being pushed across those borders. 
They’re not wanting to leave home. They want to go back. And the part 
of the solution ultimately to the crisis that is occurring needs to 
be an obligation on Yugoslavia, Serbia in particular, to take them home. 
So, not to be looking at the situation as one which produces a long-term 
shift of the population. But, given that there is an incapacity in the 
countries immediately adjacent to Serbia, who are poor counties in themselves, 
to handle the dimensions of the tasks that have been imposed upon them, 
then there is obviously a requirement for some temporary response and, 
given that we have had a view on refugees, well founded, that we have 
benefited from, ourselves, we need to ensure that we are not ungenerous 
in that regard.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Given the extent of the number of ethnic Albanians 
being kicked out of the country do you think, basically, NATO …

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, we did say originally that we understood the 
NATO response to the recalcitrance of Milosevic. But we also, at the 
time, said ‘what’s Plan B?’ And at the moment, Plan B looks a 
bit shaky.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

….(inaudible)...

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I wouldn’t presume to advise other people to do 
things that we’re not involved in ourselves. All you can say at the 
moment is the strategy does not seem to be working as you would hope 
it might.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

On that issue of troops, Mr Beazley, should Australian 
troops be in East Timor, has the situation changed any that we could 
get a comment on whatÂ

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I think that there is a serious problem developing 
in Timor. A problem more serious than was already there. The militias 
have to be disarmed, there’s no two ways about it. That is in the 
first instance the job of the Indonesian defence forces. But the clashes 
which are occurring at the moment are alarming, to say the least. And 
what perhaps ought to be hastened in this process is getting UN people 
onto the ground assessing the situation to see what sort of response 
might be necessary.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Xanana Gusmao has saidÂ  and that they should 
defend themselves....?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, I think, because he’s not an inflammatory 
person, that just is a pointer to how alarming the situation is and 
I hope that the response to what he’s had to say energises the Indonesian 
authorities to disarm those militia groups.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Downer is still, I understand, reluctant to commit 
Australian troops given the conflict that is going on there at the moment. 
Do you support that?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, we have expressed a view that we ought to have 
a preparedness to consider Australian peace keepers once there’s a 
peace to keep. And that anything that we do ought to be under United 
Nations overarching authority. So, we have been prepared to take the 
view that Australian forces in certain circumstances might be committed. 
But the issue of stabilisation on the ground in the first instance is 
fundamentally a problem for the Indonesian authorities and they need 
to act.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Peter Beattie has described some backbenchers who 
have been speaking out about Labor’s policy direction as ‘prima 
donnas’. What’s your....?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, I do thank Peter for his supportive remarks 
over the weekend. He said some very nice things about me and I will 
return the compliment — he’s a terrific Premier and he’s running 
a very good Government. I think that we’ve actually begun to settle 
pretty decently into good policy making now in the Federal Labor Caucus. 
I think that paper that I’ve been releasing today is a product of 
that. I think the speech I made a couple of weeks ago is a product of 
that. Backbenchers now are basically gainfully employed in the process 
of policy reformation in the Party. I have pointed out before to my 
colleagues, and I will keep doing so, that we do need to be able to 
conduct a reasonable debate, focussed on policy, amongst ourselves and 
a debate is a debate — that is for and against. And we do need to 
have that argument. And we need to work against the dumbing down of 
Australian politics which has occurred in the last few years. We are 
beginning to lose the capacity to respond to social needs in this country. 
We’re beginning to lose the capacity to respond to real needs for 
innovation and a better education system in this country. And part of 
the response has got to be to reactivate debate. And that will, of course, 
lead, from time to time, to disagreement. And we need to tolerate that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Have you given those backbenchers....draw out new 
policies....will be see a new education policy, new health policy....

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Absolutely, that’s the point. And our backbenchers 
are not very effectively engaged. We’ve got a lot of good committees 
functioning at the moment. But I’d say that the influx of people that 
we got in 1996 in a small number of cases, and 1998 big time have produced 
the best surge of new talent into the Labor Party for at least 20 years. 
And what we need to do now is to exploit the product.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Is that put up or shut up?Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

No. No, it’s certainly not shut up. But put up? 
Absolutely and repeatedly.
