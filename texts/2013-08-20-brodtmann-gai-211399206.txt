EMPOWERING MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE ACT

Canberra’s vibrant multicultural communities will receive a boost to their community  facilities under Federal Labor’s Building Multicultural Communities Program.

Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, Member for Canberra, Gai  Brodtmann, and Member for Fraser Andrew Leigh, today announced 30 Canberra  based organisations will share over $475,000 in funding to purchase new equipment  and improve their infrastructure.

These grants form part of the Rudd Labor Government’s $15 million Building  Multicultural Communities Program which will strengthen social cohesion and  promote inclusions in diverse communities.



“Australia’s diversity is one of our greatest strengths and that is why the Rudd Labor  Government is proud to support organisations that promote cohesion and  inclusiveness,” Minister Lundy said.

“Canberra’s multicultural organisations contribute significantly to the vibrancy and  diversity of our city,” Ms Brodtmann said.

“This funding will allow them to continue and expand their important role in our  community.”

“The funding will go towards basic tools to strengthen the work of not-for-profit  organisations that promote culture and participation by people of all age,” said Dr  Leigh.



Canberra organisations received funding under Stream 1 and Stream 2 of the  program.

Stream 1 provides grants between $1,000 and $10,000 to help organisations  purchase a range of equipment, such as computers, furniture and sporting goods.

Stream 2 of the program provides grants of up to $150,000 to community  organisations to enhance their existing facilities, to improve community access, and  to promote and foster social inclusion.



Funding for these projects is already included in the budget.
