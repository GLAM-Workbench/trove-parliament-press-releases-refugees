PRESENTER:

Let's go to our Big Guns of Politics - Environment Minister Tony Burke and Shadow  Treasurer Joe Hockey. Good morning to you both. Joe, I want to start with you and ask you  about this. Do you think households are actually getting off more lightly than was expected  initially?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, Mel. Look, this is a tax that is going to be passed through, inevitably. It is a tax on  energy. The more energy that is used in the production of something, the higher the tax  component. So, the more manufactured a good, the more energy you use during your daily  life - be it overtime with you using more electricity during the course of the day - you will pay  more of the tax because it's trying to penalise the major electricity producers which rely on

coal. Now, the impact on people is going to be such that if you value add in Australia, you  are going to pay more tax, whereas if you value add in China, you are not. That is the  simple thing.

PRESENTER:

Tony, that's the issue for me. It's so high, $23 just seems extraordinary to me that we can  start off so high but if you are an Australian manufacturer of fridges that need a lot of  energy, you are going to cop this and have to put your prices up and a consumer will more  likely more likely buy a fridge from China which doesn't have such a big carbon tax.

TONY BURKE:

The extra part of the protection that is there for Australian manufacturers - if they are in one  of those really export sensitive markets - is 94.5% of their permits initially come to them for  free. That's the way you make sure you don't end up with that export problem but for  industry generally, you get a situation at the moment where it does cost more for a  company to run a clean operation than an operation that is highly polluting. Pollution  shouldn't be free. It shouldn’t be free to pump whatever you want into the atmosphere. And  this gives a situation where you narrow that gap, you make it much more competitive for  clean energy and it has been done in a way with a package where households don't end up  behind.

PRESENTER:

Joe, you said you want to get rid of it, is it really going to be possible to undo all of this if  you get in at the next election?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely Mel, we will get rid of it and we will get rid of it in the first month.

PRESENTER:

Okay, but where will that leave businesses? I guess that will be really hard, who will have to  absorb costs at this point in time and then it is going to change. Like you say, small  businesses are the ones you feel sorry for.

JOE HOCKEY:  It is small businesses, because there is no compensation at all for around 2 million small  businesses in Australia. They will face higher electricity prices. They will face higher  embedded costs in everything they do. There's no compensation for them. Frankly, they are  some of the businesses that compete with others offshore. China and Vietnam and  Indonesia, they are miles away from ever having anything like this. Yet we are expected to  compete.

TONY BURKE:

If I can just come in quickly, if that is okay, just on that, you also then undo the household  package. From what Kochie just put up there, people get more compensation than the price  impacts. That actually means what you are promising is to have a cut in real income for  people on the pension. That's the outcome of what you've described.

JOE HOCKEY:

No.

PRESENTER:

We have got to move on because we don't want you guys to ramble on and get off without  discussing this asylum seeker debate. I think all of Australia is really annoyed with all sides  of politics after this. The offshore processing Bill defeated in the Senate. You guys are  going to go off for your winter holidays. You've handballed it, as usual, to Angus Houston to  leading an expert group to resolve the crisis. That's the greatest handball that you  politicians do. Tony, assure me that whatever Angus Houston comes up with, you will stick  by. Let's make him the umpire. Will you stick by it, rather than say ‘We thank Angus  Houston for his report but we don't agree with it’?

TONY BURKE:

I don't think you go down this process without an intention that what they come back with is  going to make a very big difference.

PRESENTER:

No, no, we want someone to make a decision. Will you let him make the decision? Will you  guarantee you will follow his decision?

TONY BURKE:

What we want to make sure of is that we can get something through the Parliament. We  went on the best expert advice. We then made some extraordinary compromises.

PRESENTER:

No, we don't want to get into the politics. We have done all this.

If I answer your question in the way you are wanting to frame it and I say ‘Whatever they  say we put up’, if they put up something that we still can't get through the Senate, that we  still have the [inaudible]

PRESENTER:

We are not worried about them, we are worried about you. Will you abide by it, as a  government?

TONY BURKE:

It's going to be highly influential on any position. We just don't want to miss the next  opportunity. We shouldn't have missed the opportunity that we have missed this week. We  don't want to see that happen again.

PRESENTER:

I thought we did. Joe, would the Coalition accept it?

JOE HOCKEY:

At four o'clock this morning - and people haven't reported this - the House of  Representatives passed a motion to bring on our Bill which would have facilitated offshore  processing in over 140 different countries. On a technicality it didn't get up but it was  passed by a majority of the House. It was initiated by Andrew Wilkie, the Independent. We  didn't know it was coming on at that time. At 4 o'clock this morning, the House decided to  go ahead with the plan B and the government shut it down. We have offered plan B.

PRESENTER:

That wasn't the question. That wasn't the question. [inaudible] I'm coming to it. No, no, all  you guys have spoken a lot about this, too much and no decision.

JOE HOCKEY:

I am telling you how a decision was being made.

PRESENTER:

No. Will you accept Angus Houston's report and abide by it? Can we make him the  independent arbiter because you guys can't agree?

JOE HOCKEY:

Can I just say this? Kochie, it is an important point, the Prime Minister announced the  committee last night. She said it has three members and she only announced two members  of it. We don't know who the other member is. We don't know what the role of the  committee is. We want decisions. We offered decisions. We offered legislation in the  House. Mate, it's easy for you to criticise the process.

PRESENTER:

Yeah, we are. We want you guys to make a decision. You flick past it as usual, like  everyone in politics, to an Independent. [inaudible] We don't want that buried. If you set up  an independent committee, we want you to abide by it.

JOE HOCKEY:

It's not our committee. This is the Prime Minister that's called this, mate.  She is contracting  out her role as Prime Minister to another committee. How many times has this government  done it? We put legislation into the parliament to facilitate offshore processing in over 140  countries and the government won't even let us bring it on for proper debate and decision-making. So please, when they talk about setting up another committee, this government,  we are highly cynical of it.

PRESENTER:

Thank you both for your time this morning. Have a wonderful weekend, gentlemen.
