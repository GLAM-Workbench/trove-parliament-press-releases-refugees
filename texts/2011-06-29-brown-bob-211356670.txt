Senator Bob Brown, Leader of the Australian Greens

National Press Club speech, 29 June 2011



Ladies and Gentlemen



I acknowledge the traditional owners of the Canberra region and all the Indigenous

people of Australia.



This Friday, 1 July, is the 28th anniversary of the High Court judgement which

stopped the Franklin Dam. But in the preceding week of 1983, Tasmania recorded

the lowest temperatures in history. It snowed heavily to sea level. The bulldozers in

the Franklin and Gordon Valley were stopped. So, Mother Nature got into the act

ahead of the High Court!



These events were a reminder to us all that, in the end, nature rules, not us. Earth

does not need us but we are nothing without it.



Yet, back down at the Gordon River dam site after the High Court decision, came an

act of senseless vandalism which has echoes in Australian politics today. Aroused by

engineers of the Hydro Electric Commission and the government of Premier Robin

Gray, dam workers took chainsaws, drills and a container of diesel oil to destroy the

three thousand year old Huon Pine tree called the Lea Tree. Smoke rose from the

funeral pyre lit by the gang, as Premier Gray helicoptered in and out of the adjacent

works area.



That great tree became collateral damage of Premier Gray’s power plans.



As with Tasmania’s Lea Tree, so with Afghanistan’s Buddhist statues of Bamayan or,

this year, Britain’s Glastonbury Thorn. Human beings can be so oblivious, uncaring

or downright destructive. Such is life on Earth.



Three thousand years ago when the Lea Tree was a sapling, Egyptians were building

pyramids. There were 50 million people on Earth. 99 percent of the planet was a

natural ecosystem.



Two thousand years ago, when the Lea tree was in robust, fecund maturity, Rome

became the first city of one million people and most of the Earth was still wild.

2



One thousand years ago, as the Lea Tree became late middle aged, there were 310

million people on Earth, Westminster Abbey was on the drawing boards, London

had around 18,000 people and China got gunpowder.



Nowadays, seven billion humans are using up Earth's renewable organic resources

at an unprecedented rate. Inequality abounds: the richest 10 percent of us owns 85

per cent of the world’s assets while, last year, world food stores ran down and the

number of our fellow Tellurians who are hungry rose from 800 million to above one

billion. For each person on the planet when the Lea Tree first sprouted, there are

now 140.



A century back, the world had amassed one billion people, but Australia had the

highest standard of living in the world. Melbourne was laying out its tramlines.

Soon it rivalled Chicago with multistorey buildings. Melbourne was helping

discover antibiotics, leading the world in the campaign for the eight hour day and

making the world's first feature length movie. A little later Sydney was building the

colossal Harbour Bridge, and inventing the rotating clothes line and lawn mower.

We had the world's leading soprano, the world's fastest swimmers and, down the

coast, Lawrence Hargraves had helped pioneer global aviation. Positive pizzazz was

a national phenomenon.



In 2011, we’re still doing very well by world standards. But where is the vision,

optimism and drive to lead the world in this nation’s political or corporate

leadership?



How is it that 80 percent of Australians want laws for euthanasia (the individual’s

right to accept death with dignity) and for equal marriage, yet the Labor Party and

Coalition are blocking both? Why is it left to the third political party to advocate

Australia’s legal and moral responsibility to quickly process asylum seekers coming

to these wealthy shores? What happened to the motto of ‘a fair go!’?



Ladies and gentlemen, every year’s delay on tackling climate change threatens to

cost us the Earth. The United Nations estimates that each year’s delay will cost one

trillion dollars. Climate change threatens the Great Barrier Reef with death within

four decades; extinction of our fellow species is at a rate not seen since an asteroid

smashed into this planet 65 million years ago; 70 percent of Earth’s fisheries are in

collapse. On a visit to Papua New Guinea last month I discovered that a Sino-

3



Australian consortium is ready to have robot bulldozers dig up the ocean floor,

thousands of metres down, for minerals off New Ireland. The tailings will be

dumped straight back into the marine ecosystem.



Meanwhile, Australia’s uranium is turning up as deadly radioactive materials in

Japanese fish and lettuce. Approximately 80,000 people have been evacuated from

the Fukushima-Australia uranium contamination zone. Back here, Martin Ferguson,

who is being challenged all the way by Scott Ludlam, is pushing the same dangerous

stuff to much less sophisticated markets than Japan. And in the midst of the mining

boom, Treasurer Swan has cut the budgets of great national cultural institutions like

the National Gallery, the National Library and the National Museum. There’s no

money for a dedicated footpath from Civic, the living centre of Canberra, to

Parliament House.



No matter what positive ideas are put forward for Australia, Tony Abbott and

Barnaby Joyce are out there saying ‘No!’, and the polls are saying ‘yes’ to ‘no’.



The Howard government backed George W Bush's invasions of Iraq and

Afghanistan in the cause of democracy. So why shouldn’t we now join vigorous

moves in Europe and at the United Nations for a global people’s assembly based on

one person, one vote, one value? Such a global parliament - it could be right here in

Australia - would tackle international questions like nuclear proliferation, currency

speculation, marine ecosystem destruction and those billion people who could be fed

and literate if only a tenth of global military spending was sent to their assistance.



Why should Australia not catch up with Norway, less than half our size, and have a

sovereign wealth fund, mandated female representation on corporate boards,

determined global outreach for peace in such horror conflicts as the Sri Lankan civil

war, and funding for the protection of large swathes of the world’s besieged tropical

rainforests?



As the Dalai Lama pointed out in Canberra a fortnight ago, being rich in the pocket

gives no certainty to being rich in the spirit. Feeling good about who we are and

what we are achieving - having a vision for a safer, happier future - is the real key to

national pride and fulfilment.

Let me quote Tasmania’s great twentieth century environmentalist and

photographer, Olegas Truchanas. Speaking at the time of the destruction of Lake

Pedder National Park, Olegas said - and I have changed ‘Tasmania’ to ‘Australia’:

"Is there any reason why [Australia] should not be more beautiful on the day we leave it,

than on the day we came? We don't know what the requirements of those who come after us

will be. If we revise our attitudes towards the land under our feet, if we can accept the role of

steward and depart from the role of conqueror, if we can accept the view that man and nature

are inseparable parts of the unified whole; then [Australia] can be a shining beacon in a dull,

uniform and largely artificial world."



What country is better placed to shine a light for the rest of the world?



We Greens say let Australia be that light. Let us take the John F Kennedy spirit

which put a man on the Moon in 1969, and use Australia’s wealth and vigour to

upgrade global prospects for the twenty first century.



Next Sunday, fifteen Greens MPs, past, present and future, are getting together to

celebrate the Greens parliamentary history stretching over 17 years.



And from Monday, ten of us will be in the parliament, including four new Senators,

representing every state in Australia. We will hold the balance of power in the

Senate and share the balance of power in the House of Representatives where Adam

Bandt represents Melbourne. Around Australia, there are 24 more Greens in state

and territory parliaments including two ministers and a speaker, and more than 100

Greens in local government, including several mayors and deputies.

We have more than 10,000 party members, 35,000 Australian Greens fans on

Facebook, thousands who follow us on Twitter, and tens of thousands ‘signed up’ to

receive our news and give us feedback. Last year, more than 1.6 million Australians

voted Green.



The four new Greens on Capital Hill are Penny Wright from South Australia,

Richard Di Natale from Victoria, Lee Rhiannon from New South Wales and Larissa

Waters from Queensland.



Now I know a few media folk are not so much interested in vision as they are in

division. For them, I am going to be a disappointment. We Greens do have healthy

disagreements. After all, we don’t believe in cloning. But, united by the Greens

5



Charter, we are united and on the move to give Australians a big Green dividend

from Canberra.



And we have runs on the board. Last year we made an agreement for government

with Prime Minister Gillard. Since we signed that agreement - and I commend Julia

Gillard and her colleagues for following it up - Green dividends have been achieved:



There is good progress towards a 2013 referendum to recognise Indigenous

Australians in the Constitution;

Last week Minister Simon Crean announced that Justice Spigelman will lead

an expert panel for a second referendum to recognize local government in the

Constitution;

$24.9 million has been allocated to establish a Parliamentary Budget Office,

for costing parties' policies and promises. This was a Greens' initiative which I

announced here at the  National Press Club during the last election campaign;

The Government has committed to substantial dental health reforms in next

year’s budget and Rachel Siewert's National Dental Advisory Council is being

set up to advise on dental care;

The promised high speed rail study will be released next month. This

visionary prospect for Australia, which Adam Bandt highlighted in his

election campaign, has had both Italian and French companies visiting

Australia in recent weeks;

There is a national inquiry into electoral funding (thank you John Faulkner),

and we will  continue to pursue laws requiring truth in political advertising;

There will be a commission to set the ground rules for future Leaders Debates

on television;

And I happily report Ã¢ÂÂall commitments metÃ¢ÂÂ on meeting Prime Minister

Gillard regularly, on new rules for question time, and on weekly private

members time having been allocated in both houses.



Our first female Prime Minister’s first year in office has been highlighted by rapid

progress on the national broadband network and a massive boost in spending on

mental health and rapid assistance to people in several states suffering the impact of

floods and storms.

Add to that:

Julia Gillard’s agreement to guarantee $100 million for the solar flagship

program. This will ensure two more baseload solar plants will proceed in

rural Australia, besides those already flagged for Chinchilla in Queensland

and Moree in New South Wales.

The Government also agreed to the Greens - Christine Milne’s - reform of the

fringe benefits taxes on corporate cars. This freed up 970 million dollars for

the wider national interest over the next four years, while cutting greenhouse

gases. That’s more than enough to fully re-fund the National Gallery, the

National Library and the National Museum, Treasurer Swan.



In the past 12 months, the Greens have also been an ideas bank in parliament:

My Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill will, if

passed,  give both the ACT and the Northern Territory the right to make their

own laws without being overruled by a federal minister;

Adam Bandt’s banking bills would ban the regressive $2 fee at ATMs - these

fees are prohibited in the UK;

Rachel Siewert’s Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill would stop

the export of live animals for slaughter now - not in three years as in the

Xenophon-Wilkie bill. Export of live animals too often ends up in cruelty and

it also ships Australian jobs and profits off-shore;

Sarah Hanson-Young has presented the parliament with her Marriage

Equality Bill;

Scott Ludlam is challenging parliament to set up a national container deposit

scheme; and

Next week I will introduce a new bill to protect children from junk food

advertising, not just on free-to-air television, but through all forms of

telecommunications - including pay TV, internet and mobile phones.



Overarching all of this, led by Christine Milne, the Greens have put a carbon price

and clean energy on the nation's political agenda. I remain confident that we, Labor

and the independents can achieve an agreement to tackle global warming in the next

couple of weeks. But against such sensible action run a number of mining barons.

They not only oppose a polluter-pays scheme, but they also oppose Australians

getting a fair benefit from the mining boom. And they have form.

The mining industry derailed Ken Henry’s proposal for a Resource Super Profits

Tax. It spent 22 million dollars on an advertising campaign, smashed the tax, and

blocked tens of billions of dollars from flowing to the Australian public, which owns

the minerals in the first place. Only the Australian Greens opposed this putsch on

Canberra. We will continue to campaign for the Treasury-formulated super profits

tax as well as for a sovereign wealth fund so all Australians can benefit from the

boom.



As Canberra buckled under the mining billionaires' bulldozer, it left a thinner purse

for public infrastructure like bikeways; housing; solar power; cheap light rail in our

cities; fast regional rail; and, between the biggest cities, high speed rail.



Labor's compromise on the mining tax may cost the public purse 100 billion dollars

over the coming decade. But Tony Abbott, who sides with Gina Rinehart and Xstrata

in opposing any tax at all, would rob a further forty-five billion dollars from that

thinner public purse. This mining industry is largely foreign owned.  While

Australia gets jobs, export income, royalties and company tax from our minerals, the

foreign owners get profits, dividends, capital appreciation and influence. Most of

Treasury's planned super profits tax is now due to end up in the deep, deep pockets

of millionaires in Switzerland, London, Calcutta and Beijing, rather than in

Australian schools, hospitals or railways.



Some $50 billion reaped from Australia’s mineral resources will be sent overseas as

dividends to foreign owners according to a Greens-commissioned paper I am

releasing today - Foreign ownership of Australian mining by economist Naomi

Edwards.



Key findings of her report on foreign ownership and Australian mining profits are:

In the next five years foreign owners will earn about $265 billion from their

investments in Australia’s mineral resources;

Increasing foreign ownership is creating a significant drag on Australia’s

current account balance;

Recently, Australia’s net income balance broke below its long-term floor of -3%. It is forecast to deteriorate to -6% by 2013, worsening Australia’s current

account deficit as it goes;

BHP Billiton’s profit margin has almost doubled in the past eight years, from

25% in 2002 to 45% in 2010. BHP’s profit margin on iron ore is 62%;

8



For every dollar of sales, mining companies make an after-tax profit of 26%

versus the average across all industries of 8%;

Employment costs (including all contractor expenses) are lower in mining at

12% than the average across industries at 17%;

Net profit margins for copper and gold are 23% and 27% respectively, and yet

they are being excluded from the government’s mining tax. They should be

included;

And Australia’s foreign-owned mining industry will ship $50 billion in

dividends offshore over the next five years.



Amid a mining boom, while the federal government faces budget pressures and as

the Reserve Bank of Australia prepares to raise interest rates, parts of the economy

are wallowing.



The Edwards report, which shows Australian mining companies are 83% foreign

owned, underscores the need for the Government to reconsider the Mineral

Resource Rent Tax and the tax cut planned for big business. In the Senate, I will

again move to expand the MRRT, including to cover gold and uranium, oppose the

company tax cut for big business, and work to set up a sovereign wealth fund.



I repeat, the mining boom is creating massive problems for other parts of the

Australian economy. If the country’s minerals wealth is not properly managed,

many Australians will actually be worse off and Australia’s prosperity will be put at

risk.



Treasury’s mining super profits tax would have preserved about 20% of forecast

foreign profits for Australians. The government should adopt the Greens’ proposal

for a sovereign wealth fund to store this wealth for the needs of future generations.



Instead, under Labor’s reduced mining tax and the Coalition’s irresponsible

prescription to let the foreign mining giants off the hook altogether, Australians will

be left in future cribbing on health, education and scrounging for funding for key

infrastructure such as high speed rail.



Whichever way you look at it, Australia should have a better discussion about

optimal mineral extraction rates, value-adding and profit ownership.

While on resources, I laud the work of all those trying to reach an historic agreement

on logging in Tasmania, an agreement set to protect 572,000 hectares of the island’s

grandest forests. But let no public money flow to a Gunns pulp mill, to the huge

Malaysian logging company Ta Ann or to the consortium bidding to buy the

Triabunna woodchip mill. Let’s leave all three entities to the free market! Should

they complain? Tasmania’s logging corporations have soaked up one billion dollars

in public subsidies in recent decades - and while we have no trouble assisting the

workers and contractors, not another public dollar should go to the big industrial

logging outfits.



Ladies and Gentlemen: From the wild forests to Canberra politics!

The Constitution states, in sections 53 to 56, that ‘the Senate shall have equal powers

with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws’ other than those

which create a tax or appropriate money.

So, only the government can raise taxes. Agreed. But what does the Constitution

mean by ‘appropriate money’? Is it a quantifiable amount with a quantifiable impact

on the Government’s balance sheet? Is it spending some money, somewhere, at some

point in time? It is hard to think of a bill which does not impose some cost on the

taxpayer. Even a bill which seeks to reduce tax will put a cost on the Treasury’s time

and resources.

The Senate and the House do not see eye to eye on this.

Last month, a Coalition bill to ensure workers aged 70 years or more have their

employers pay the nine percent superannuation top-up was ruled out of order by

the Speaker of the House. The Speaker relied on the House Standing Orders, which

are not part of the Constitution and actually go further than the Constitution to state

that no private member can put forward a bill which appropriates money because it

will be disallowed. The House Standing Orders appear to rule out most private

members bills. The Executive, which in former days wrote the House Standing

Orders, rules.

The next test may be Sarah Hanson-Young’s bill to establish a Commissioner for

Children. Her bill is clearly neither a tax bill, nor, an appropriation bill. What will the

House do with this bill if it passes the Senate? How does the Speaker rule this $1

million bill in, having recently ruled the Opposition’s $300 million bill out?



10



This matter is non justiciable by the High Court and cannot be left to the opinion of

the Clerks or to unilateral Standing Orders. All parties should commit to a mature,

bicameral agreement to settle this issue before the lightning and thunder of a

constitutional storm is unleashed in times ahead.

The Greens are leading on the road to solving this quite crucial Constitutional

dilemma. I offer you this commitment as a further indication of how we will

continue to serve Australia on our current responsible course. We will contribute

sensible ideas to solve policy and political problems and we will continue to work to

provide stability for the duly constituted Gillard government.

The Greens will be a secure rock of stability in the Senate, to help make sure

Australia gets the good governance it deserves. To that end, we will not be

supporting any Coalition move in the Senate, whether by legislation or amendments,

that threaten instability. The Coalition may move such a motion, but we will not be

supporting it.

Isn't politics exciting? I can tell you that it is a great privilege to be elected by

Australians. It is not the office itself, but the gains made for the nation by having that

office, which offer MPs real satisfaction.  I think that I will never be a minister, or

have the Order of the Garter. Yet I doubt there is any elected representative feeling

happier about their job than me. And I can't wait for next week's induction of the

four vigorous and intelligent new Greens senators. How organically sweet this

Greening age of politics is!



I thank you all.
