E&OE

MARK COLLIER:

Opposition Leader welcome to the program.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks for having me Mark, and thanks for that nice wrap.

MARK COLLIER:

Have you become a master of self control, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ah no, but I have managed to be pretty disciplined over the last three weeks and let’s hope I can continue.

MARK COLLIER:

You certainly have and we know so many people are impressed too. Now you have just come from your book

launch, do you want to put a plug in for a great Christmas gift idea with just 24-30 hours to go?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah look I would love to do that. It is only $35, which is not nothing but nevertheless you can easily spend more

on a present for your loved ones. So look, if you have got someone who you need to buy for who is interested in

politics or public life, I think Battlelines ought to be a contender for the Christmas stocking.

MARK COLLIER:

Now you have re-written the end, is that right?

TONY ABBOTT:

I haven’t re-written the end, I have added an afterword which I have called “A Week Really Can Be a Long Time

in Politics” because it basically tells the story of the period between the Tuesday of that fateful Shadow Cabinet

meeting and party room meeting, from that Tuesday until the following Tuesday when we had the change of

leadership. So I can’t say it is an absolutely exhaustive account of that week, but it is I think the story of what I

think were the significant parts of that week, and again if people are interested in politics I think it is a good

subject to read up on.

MARK COLLIER:

It is impressive you could find the time to write another chapter. We spoke yesterday to Kristina Keneally, the

new, or newish, new New South Wales Premier and I said to her you have been in the game now for, or the hot

seat for three weeks, what does it feel like? How long does it feel? She said three weeks, which was a very

political answer. You seem to have taken on a different persona since taking on the leadership role. Now you

might not agree with that, but I think that is the perception out there. You must be feeling very comfortable so far?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that is probably a good thing Mark because the public perception previously was often a bit ragged. Look, I’d

like to think that, just as most people grow into a bigger role, that I’ve mellowed a bit. But in the end people will

form their own impressions and I am not going to be able to argue them into changing bad impressions and I am

not going to be able to win them over by giving you advertising spiels. So look, I will do my best and hopefully

others will come to a judgement.

MARK COLLIER:

You have some great issues to run with and you have been running with them very effectively for a few weeks

now. There’s the issue of the asylum seekers and the scores of boatloads reaching our waters, there’s

dissatisfaction with the state of health care - something which Kevin Rudd committed to sorting out himself - and

of course there’s climate change and ETS. You have come in at a great time really for an Opposition Leader but

the previous Opposition Leader didn’t capitalise on what you have done. Do you see this as a dream run or do

you think you are a much smarter politician? I am very interested in how you’re approaching it.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think I’m probably a bit luckier than my predecessors in that I think Kevin Rudd’s long honeymoon is finally

starting to end. I think that a change of leader gives political parties an opportunity to refocus and I think

unfortunately we have been a bit introspective, we have been a bit self-referential for some time. I think we have

got over that. I think we are now focussing on the errors of the Government - and that’s what an opposition,

Mark, should be doing, it should be focussing on the errors of the Government - and I think there are going to be

some pretty big issues next year. There’s going to be economic management and continued interest rate rises.

There’s going to be Labor’s obsession with tax and higher taxes, particularly the ETS. There will be continued

boat arrivals because of Kevin Rudd’s watering down of the previously successful policies. I think that Kevin

Rudd’s failure to deliver on his public hospital promises is going to be a very significant issue. So look, I will keep

pushing ahead and at the same time my colleagues and I will be developing I hope credible alternative policies.

MARK COLLIER:

We had a call while we were awaiting to talk to you this afternoon from Jerry, who said to us we should raise with

you what will you do about the boat people. What will you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well the elements of a successful policy to deter the people smugglers and their clients are: offshore processing

- and that is something which the Government has effectively ended; good work with the countries that are

currently dealing with boat people and potential boat people - and one of Mr Rudd’s big mistakes was to engage

in megaphone diplomacy with the Indonesians rather than working quietly behind the scenes as the former

government did. We have got to make sure that there is a visa for unauthorised arrivals which doesn’t give them

a guaranteed prize - and the prize they are all seeking is permanent residency in Australia for them and for their

extended families. And the fourth thing we need to do, we need to be prepared under the right circumstances to

turn boats around. Now the policy worked under the former government and while the circumstances will

inevitably be different, and because the circumstances will be different, there will have to be some

accommodations in terms of policy. I think it can work again and it is just sad Mark that Mr Rudd took a policy that

was working, watered it down and we are now all living with the consequences.

MARK COLLIER:

Yeah, I have a partner who is applying for residency and we are about to get seriously into that process and we

have just been told it will take six to eight months to process and one of our producers here has suggested we

should put her on a boat and send her to Christmas Island, she will be here in time for Easter. It is a sad situation

and yes, it is obviously an attractive package for these people who are putting all this together.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that is right Mark, and I can fully understand why desperate people living in wretched circumstances would

regard Australia as an absolute beacon of hope. But we can’t be a lifeboat to the world. And there are hundreds

of thousands, if not millions of people living within a boat ride of Australia who might come if they think it is an

open door policy…

MARK COLLIER:

It is easy, yeah…

TONY ABBOTT:

…and that’s why it is so important that we send the appropriate signal to people smugglers and their clients and

that’s where Mr Rudd has made such a terrible mistake.

MARK COLLIER:

Can we move on to the ETS?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure.

MARK COLLIER:

India has now confirmed that it worked with China and other developing countries to shoot down any likelihood of

binding targets being agreed too for greenhouse gas emissions. Was Kevin Rudd always dreaming with what he

took to Copenhagen?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah I think there was always such terrible conceit in the Prime Minister’s position - this idea that Australia could

save the world on its own, this idea that our Prime Minister was somehow going to lead the world the way, for

argument sake, you know, FDR or Ronald Ragan or Margaret Thatcher might have. And look, it is important that

our voice be heard. It is important that we stand up for our values and our interests. But I think Kevin Rudd tried

to be kind of a less judicious version of John Howard, without John Howard’s record of solid achievement under

this belt.

MARK COLLIER:

The ETS legislation is due to comeback to Parliament in February. Do you think it will go back in its current form

or do you think the Government will be forced to make changes between now and then?

TONY ABBOTT:

That is a very interesting question and what is now obvious is that any Australian ETS would be a ‘go it alone’

emissions tax. That is the first thing that is obvious. The second thing that is obvious is that Australian business is

now very, very anxious about this emissions tax and they were, in many cases, prepared to go along with it when

they thought their competitors would have to live with the same regime but they are not at all happy about it now.

The third thing that’s obvious is that there is a real people power revolt against this big new tax and it is being led

in many cases, not by traditional Liberals, but by traditional Labor voters - blue collar workers in industries like

coal mining who know that their jobs will be much less safe if Mr Rudd has his way and brings this in. And you

know it was interesting, Mark, that in the recent by-elections the areas that got quite strong swings to the Liberal

Party were the blue collar areas and this is why I think the hard-headed people in Mr Rudd’s party are now quite

anxious about what he’s doing.

MARK COLLIER:

Yeah. There certainly is a groundswell out there and it is growing. You’d have to blind not to realise that and they

are lots of electors too.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and, look, 2GB has obviously been very focussed on this issue and it just goes to show how

important an active and vigilant media are because a lot of other media outlets wanted to pretend that there was

some kind of unquestionable consensus on this and 2GB had the guts to say ‘hang on a minute, we have got to

think twice’.

MARK COLLIER:

What degree of modification to the legislation would you require to support it when it goes back to Parliament?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we just won’t support an emissions trading scheme at all unless it had become so much a part of the

international economic order that there was no danger whatsoever that it would unfairly penalise our industries

and discriminate against Australian jobs. Now the only time Australia should think about and ETS would be if

effectively if the Americans adopt one and I think that is highly unlikely in the near future.

MARK COLLIER:

Moving on quickly to health care. You have a plan for a referendum on public hospitals if you are elected.

TONY ABBOTT:

That is probably putting it a little bit too strongly, Mark. You know, what my plan is, my plan is to get the

bureaucracy out of public hospitals because that is what is killing our public hospital system and that’s what is

subjecting our hardworking public hospital doctors and nurses to so much pressure. Now I think that the

establishment of local hospital boards is the biggest single reform that we could make in this area and while it

wouldn’t solve all problems it would certainly make all problems easier to manage and it would give people

ownership of the solutions to these problems - and that’s what is really critical.

Now if the state governments were prepared to go down this path, great - I wouldn’t want to interfere. The

problem is that Mr Rudd seems to be completely paralysed by his state Labor mates and completely paralysed

by the power of the health sector unions - and I just don’t think there will be any meaningful reform from him.

So I want him to honour his commitments. I want him to fix the hospital problem like he said he would. If he won’t,

well I will have some solutions, but there is a policy making process that we have to go through and the story in

the Herald yesterday was an accurate story about what has been discussed but it didn’t mean that we had

finalised our policy.

MARK COLLIER:

Tony, the Prime Minister says you had I think, what was it, five years as Health Minister in the Howard

Government to achieve reform but you didn’t.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I don’t pretend that I solved every problem. But I think I was pretty good, along with my colleagues, at

making the federally run parts of the health system work well. Medicare was working very well, the PBS was

working very well, the aged care system was not perfect but it was working better than before, when we left office

at the end of `07. The big problem was public hospitals, which are run by the state Labor governments. Now the

paradox of the `07 election was that John Howard got blamed for the problems which the state Labor

governments had created and federal Labor was the unworthy beneficiary really of the mistakes of state Labor.

And as I said that’s the paradox of the `07 election when it comes to health.

Now, as I said, there’s a lot of unfinished business as far as I am concerned in health and I certainly look forward

to making a much better fist of addressing public hospital problems in the future than Mr Rudd has and even than

I was able to in the past.

MARK COLLIER:

Tony, before we leave you, probably a much more important issue then the ones we have been touching on and

I’d really like to get some clarification on the issue of you and budgie smugglers. Now lifesavers wear budgie

smugglers, you are a lifesaver, what’s the problem for Mrs Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

My darling angel wife has a very strong sense of aesthetics, and I think she feels that while it is alright for me to

wear them if I have too it is best if I am not photographed, and so that is why I am under instructions to try not to

parade myself in public in that way.

MARK COLLIER:

Do we still see you lifesaving?

TONY ABBOTT:

I was down there doing patrol for a couple of hours on Sunday. I wasn’t able to do the full patrol because I had a

couple of commitments in the day. But yeah look, within reason I will keep doing my patrols this summer and

hopefully in all the summers ahead.

MARK COLLIER:

It is a bit difficult to do a full patrol in a dinner suit?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is. But I am on the morning patrol and you don’t normally have to wear a dinner suit at lunch time. But, yeah,

apart from anything else, Mark, it is a great way to stay in touch. You can go to all sorts of political meetings and

you get to talk to the committed people, but when you go down to the beach and you are chatting to your fellow

patrol members it is a very broad cross section of the community and so you get a lot of good advice. You keep

your feet firmly on the ground.

MARK COLLIER:

I am sure you do. I think there was a bit of advice at your book launch this afternoon too.

TONY ABBOTT:

A bit of that. Good and bad.

MARK COLLIER:

Tony Abbott, thank you for your time. All the best to you for Christmas, happy holy Christmas for you and the

family and we wish you all the best for a very prosperous and successful 2010. It is going to be a very interesting

year for you and a very interesting year for the rest of us because of that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Mark and all the best to you and your listeners.
