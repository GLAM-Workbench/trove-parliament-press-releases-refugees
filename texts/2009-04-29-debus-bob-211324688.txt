BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSELS

Border Protection Command today intercepted two suspected illegal entry vessels in  Australia’s north.

A Customs and Border Protection vessel, Ashmore Guardian, intercepted a vessel with seven  people on board, one nautical mile north of Ashmore Island with HMAS Maitland in support.

During the second interception, a P3 patrol aircraft under the control of Border Protection  Command sighted the vessel and a Royal Australian Navy patrol boat HMAS Launceston  was quickly deployed.

It intercepted the vessel approximately 27 nautical miles west of Bathurst Island with  Customs and Border Protection vessels Holdfast Bay and Arnhem Bay in support.

Early indications are that there are approximately 72 people on board.

Passengers from both vessels will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo  health and security checks to determine their identity and reasons for their  travel.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, said the successful interceptions demonstrated  the effectiveness of Border Protection Command’s targeted surveillance.

“Under Border Protection Command, officers from Customs and Border Protection and the  Royal Australian Navy continue to work together to protect Australia from unauthorised  arrivals.”
