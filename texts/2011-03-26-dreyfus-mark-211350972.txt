EARTH HOUR 2011

Lights at Government sites around Australia will be turned off tonight as part of Earth Hour, the  Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet, and the Parliamentary Secretary  for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mark Dreyfus, said today.

Mr Combet said Earth Hour was an important event because it raised public awareness about  improving our energy efficiency - in the home, the workplace and in the community.

To get involved in the world’s largest climate change campaign, participants need to turn off all  non- essential lights from 8.30pm local time for one hour.

Iconic sites including Old Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial will be affected, as well  as Australian embassies and posts around the world.

“Australian Government agencies are committed to Earth Hour 2011,” Mr Dreyfus said. “One  hundred per cent of agencies which report their energy use to the program for Energy Efficiency in  Government Operations (EEGO) have registered to participate in Earth Hour again this year. These  126 agencies cover 3,720 Government sites and more than 6 million square metres of floor  space.”

Mr Dreyfus said the success of events such as Earth Hour showed how important the environment  was not only to Australians, but globally.

Earth Hour started in Australia and has become a global event.

“Earth Hour is a great example of how a simple idea can grow into something big,” Mr Dreyfus  said.

“In just a few short years, this idea has taken the world by storm.  It shows us that people are  ready to do their part to meet the challenge of climate change.”
