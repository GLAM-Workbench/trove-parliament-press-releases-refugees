JOURNALIST

... following Rupert Murdoch’s comments yesterday that you now have both Rupert  Murdoch and Kerty Packer on side?

HOWARD

I haven’t the faintest idea. This is not a contest as to which media proprietor is on which  side. I deal in the substance of issues and what M r Murdoch said yesterday was to echo  the concerns o f millions o f Australians, that we do have an appallingly high level of  youth unemployment, and one o f the reasons we have it is we have a huge foreign debt  Foreign debt drives up interest rates and high interest rates destroy business, which in  turn destroys jobs. And until there is a greater recognition by this Government o f the link  between the appalling level o f our foreign debt and high real interest rates, they won’t  even have a glimmer o f understanding some o f the fundamental weaknesses o f our  economy.

JOURNALIST:

When did you last speak with Rupert Murdoch?

HOWARD:

About three months ago, when he was out here for the Hayman Island Conference. I  didn’t see him in Adelaide yesterday, if that's the conspiracy theory the burrow o f which  you are about to go down.

JOURNALIST

No. Did he indicate his feelings about the economy at that time to you?

HOWARD

Oh, we talked about a lot o f things, but I’ve always respected the privacy o f  conversations with people when I have private conversations with them. But look, it’s no  secret I was invited to participati; in the Hayman Island Conference as was my Labor  opponent, and Mr Major’s Labor opponent in England.

JOURNALIST

Did Mr Murdoch indicate to you that he’d be supporting you in tire next election?

HOWARD:

Good heavens no. We didn’t discuss who he was going to “support or not support”.

JOURNALIST

Just cm the issue last night, you mentioned youth unemployment, the problems o f young  people leaving regional centres, bow will a Coalition Government be good for regional  Australia?

HOWARD:

Because we will give small business more incentive and more hope. The key to arresting  the drift of young people away from regional Australia is to revitalise small business. It’s  - that’s the long term answer. Unless you do th at you have no hope of arresting that  drift. Therefore, policies have to be directed towards removing the shackles on small  business, like the foolish unfair dismissal laws, the red tape of the fringe benefits tax, all  of those things that make it unattractive for small business to take risks and to employ  people. And of course that brings us back to high interest rates. There is an absolute link  between foreign debt and high real interest rates. Even Mr Keating’s much cherished

Economist magazine which he’s so fond of quoting certified to that in its most recent  survey o f the world economy.

JOURNALIST

Anything in particular for this region, Mr Howard?

HOWARD:

Well, revitalising small business around Australia will have benefits in this region, and  that is more important, more imtiortant than any other single measure because therein lies  the hope o f turning around the march o f young people to the big cities.

JOURNALIST

Since the comments from Rupert Murdoch, Ralph Willis has said that Australia’s  economy should be envied by a lot o f countries because it is doing better than a lot o f  western countries. What would you say?

HOWARD:

Well, it’s not. He’s wrong. It’s lypical of the fairyland atmosphere in which this  Government operates. We have the worst current account deficit bar none in the  industrialised world. We have a very high rate o f youth unemployment. We have very  large foreign debt exposure, we have veiy high real interest rates, I think only Italy has  slightly higher real interest rates amongst industrialised countries. Now that’s his idea of  envy, then he’s got a lot more economics to learn than even I thought.

JOURNALIST

So you’re saying that the Treasurer doesn’t have any idea about Treasmy...

HOWARD:

Well, I’m disagreeing with his analysis, strongly disagreeing with his analysis of the  Australian economy.

JOURNALIST

How big a change do you think you’ll need with Public Service to start getting spending  down?

HOWARD:

I’m sorry what..

JOURNALIST

...(inaudible)... as part of your strategy in terms o f controlling the economy, you’re going  to have to make savings. Have you started finalising how much savings you’re going to  have to make?

Â«

I

HOWARD:

Well any savings that we’ll going to make which are material to particular election  commitments, they’ll be made known before the election. But we’re not into a slash and  bum exercise as far as the generality o f the Public Service is concerned. That doesn’t  mean to say there aren’t areas of duplication and overlap that can’t be eliminated, but the

major changes that have to take jplace in the Australian economy are related to the supply  bottlenecks related to the rigidity o f our labour market, the inefficiency o f our wharves  and ports, all of those things that drive up the cost o f doing business in this country. It is  too expensive for business to be conducted in Australia, and that is the main thing that  must be tackled.

JOURNALIST

What message will you be giving to the workers at BHP this morning in relation to the  Coalition’s industrial relations policy?

HOWARD:

That under a Coalition Government, workers can look forward to higher wages based on  higher productivity.

JOURNALIST

You mentioned last night that you weren’t about breaking unions in places like BHP.  Could you just tell us about that?

HOWARD:

Absolutely. There’s nothing in our policy that in any way challenges the arrangements  that companies like BHP have wi th their unions. As far as the operation o f awards and so  forth is concerned, what we want to put into the system is flexibility and choice. If  people want an union, they have it. If they want the protection as they see it o f a union, if

they want to be a union member, they a complete right to do so without any fear o f  victimisation. But equally if they don’t want to, they should have the right to do so  without fear o f victimisation, and that is the difference between me and my Labor  opponent. He wants to force people to belong to unions. He wants to drag small  businessmen into the industrial relations net, and the PAYE tax net against their will.

That’s the difference, he wants to compel people, I want to give people choice. Thank  you.
