I am pleased to announce Australia will provide $1 million to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the emergency
repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Zaire.

The condition of
up to 100 000 refugees in the area south of Kisangani has become desperate.
Up to 120 refugees are dying each day and aid workers fear a major
humanitarian catastrophe.

Following an agreement with Zairean
rebels on April 5, the UNHCR is urgently finalising plans to airlift the
most vulnerable refugees from the Kisangani area to Goma. It is hoped those
most in need - such as those requiring urgent medical attention - will be
flown out in the next few days.

With only four small planes
currently at its disposal, the UNHCR will be able to airlift approximately
1500 people a day only. In an effort to accelerate the repatriation program,
the UNHCR is attempting to secure an agreement with Zairean rebel leaders
for the establishment of overland transport corridors. Separate negotiations
are also under way between UNHCR and Rwandan officials about the possibility
of transporting refugees directly to Kigali in Rwanda.

There
are an estimated 873 000 refugees in the Great Lakes region, including 210
000 refugees whose whereabouts have been uncertain since they fled camps in
Bukavu and Goma in November.

The Australian Government supports
and commends the continued efforts of aid workers to stabilise the situation
in the region and avert further crises.

An officer from AusAID
will travel to the Great Lakes region early next week, in order to report
back to the Government on the humanitarian situation there.
