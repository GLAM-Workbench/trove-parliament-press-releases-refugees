QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWING ADDRESS TO COMMONWEALTH  JOURNALIST'S ASSOCIATION

MELBOURNE

"  V

Question (Wio Joustra) .  '

I see you are wearing your elephant's hair bracelet.  (Inaudible).... as far as peace and friendship is concerned,given the  the fact that the two superpowers who hold the key to peace and  friendship in the world were not present at CHOGM, can you tell  us what you think CHOGM has contributed to peace and friendship.

Prime Minister

I think (inaudible) - I am not going to speak about the whole  communique again - I think it has contributed a very great deal. We have made a number of very practical decisions. You have 40  countries that know each other a great deal better than they would

have before,  and old friendships were being renewed.  But peace and  friendship is not just a question of the relationship between  superpowers.  I have had a view for a very,  very long while that  middle ranking countries have got to pay attention to the problems

of peace and friendship in the world.  These subjects are too .  '   important to leave to the superpowers alone. What any one country  of Australia's size, or what others can do by themselves may well . .  .   be limited, but if middle rankihg countries which are aligned or  non-aligned - and I said something very like this in India when I .  _ visited there for their National Day two or three years ago t  - Â· middle ranking countries whether aligned or non-aligned, can work x

together in a productive way to help ease tensions and the difficulties  of the world... If. anyone can see the consequences - and I have said:  this on a number of occasions - if anyone wants to see the  consequences of leaving these issues to the superpowers alone

just go over the. road to the Australian War Memorial and look at  the names carved in stone.  Go to every town throughout this entire  Commonwealth of A.ustralia. and see the war memorial for their own . people who have fought in so many wars since the Boer War because

they believed it was important to their freedom, for themselves, for  their families and for their children. I added it all up, and I  found we had people at war for more than half the entire life of  Australia as a Federation. We do not need any excuse for being

concerned with the great issues of peace and war. It is very  important that middle ranking powers take an interest and stop the  past repeating itself.

Question

On the issue of Namibia, you expressed a fairly cautious optimism. '   What happens if the efforts of the contact group are again frustrated  by South Africa. What other alternative for action is there,  especially as the Commonwealth has (inaudible), towards that group

and not come out of it with any other line of attacking the problem?

. . . /2

Q&A 2 8/10/81

I think we need to understand that it is basically a United  Nations problem. The contact group are there to implement the  United Nations resolution. It is not a Commonwealth problem as . was Rhode si a-Zimbabwe,  which was Britain and Rhodesia very much.

Therefore it is not in the Commonwealth's court as was Zimbabwe. Also, I think, we need to be conscious of' the fact that there are  various processes in train over the coming days and weeks that the  contact group are involved in. The United States has clearly made

the view, and it is worth noting, that the contact group — Canada,  Britain, France and Germany - have, as I understand it, they have  all been acting as one. The pressure that has been applied to  South Africa is private pressure, but that does not mean to say

it is not real. I do not think it would be productive or useful  at this point to say what we would do if this present part of the  process fails. I think we need to bend all our energies towards .  Â·   trying to make the present processes successfulÃ¢ÂÂ That is why the  communique was designed to give maximum support to the contact  group. If it does not work, well then countries no doubt will be  consulting about what they might need to do. But there are some  things I think in the international arena where it is much better  not to speculate about what you would do if you fail, but rather

to bend all your efforts to being successful.  .

Question "

Prime Minister, now that you are no longer host chairman of "7 the Commonwealth...and that you don't have to give that particular  courtesy to other Commonwealth leaders, is there anything you would Â·   like to say about Mr. Muldoon ... '

Prime Minister Â·  -

Prime Minister

I could never possibly emulate the answer that Julius Nyerere gave  to that question. (Inaudible),  but I do not know if any of you  saw it, but it was a beautiful answer. Mr. Muldoon was a guest in  our country and I (inaudible) in any critical way on any guest  of this country. v

Question(John Dickie, Daily Mail).  Ã¢ÂÂ

Prime Minister, is there not an implicit danger in your  suggestion that the Soviet Union should become more involved in  international (inaud).. because surely to (inaudible) there might  be an (inaudible)... by Soviet ideology.

Prime Minister I

I think it is important to understand when we are talking about Ã¢ÂÂ Â» -   aid in these terms - and we discussed this in some length - it  needs to be aid without strings:  aid that is not disruptive of the national policies and objectives of a particular government.  The only aid that is going to be successful is aid of that kind.

This is one of the reasons, I suppose,while the Soviets advocate  (inaudible) , they are quite incapable of understanding that and believe  that people have to Soviets and communists or (inaudible) before  they are prepared to do anything. I doubt very much whether the Soviet  will change their attitude, but I think what is important is the

. .. /3

g&a 3 8/10/81

prime M i n i s t e r (continued)

recognition,by 40 countries, that the Soviet Union, is not helping,  ought to be helping, but I suspect (inaudible) they probably  will not. .

Question

If we just take it outside the realm of CHOGM for a moment. .  Last week Anwar Sadat was quoted as saying that he could be  assassinated next week and that could be the start of World War  Three. Unfortunately his first prediction proved accurate. What would your reaction be to his second prediction?

Prime Minister '

I do not think the second prediction will prove to be accurate.  It is too early yet to assess the fall-out from President Sadat's .  -   assassination. All Heads of Government were totally horrified  at what had occurred. Not everyone, as we know,  agreed with  what President Sadat was doing. Australia had great and enormous respect for him, for his courage. I think that that was fairly

common throughout much of the world. There was certainly great Â·   respect for him as a person amongst all those Heads of Government.  I believe that we all recognise the dangers that can come out of  the Middle Eastern area, but at the same time these things sometimes  work in strange ways.  There is only one way to justify -

President Sadat's life.and to establish some kind of memorial to ,   it, to have people even more determined that peace will be .  established in the Middle East,  'that the problems of the Middle East  will be resolved, that injustices will be overcome. Now, we are too Ã¢ÂÂ  close to the event to know whether people are going to have a Â·  '

capacity to arise above themselves and build on what President Sadat v  began, but I really do believe amongst all the leaders around the  world there is an understanding of the horrific nature of a world  war. I do not think anyone wants it. So, I do not really believe

that that prediction will come about.

Question (Robin Poke, Radio Australia) *  I

You referred today to the United States and its relationship '   with Australia in fairly bleak terms. You met President Reagan  once. On the Cancun issue,  how confident are you that  President Reagan will to any extent climb down from his perceived

hard line on assistance to Southern nations at Cancun.

Prime Minister .  .

I did not make a bleak reference to the United States and our  relationship to the United States. I was just saying something which I have said on many occasions before - that we will agree with . countries when we agree with them, and if we do not, we disagree  with them. It was really a reference to a headline - oh, it might

have been (inaudible) or three months ago - saying 1  difficult for  Fraser because he might be forced into a different position with  the United States'. I was just in one sense saying, (inaudible)...  It was over Namibia, and there really is no difference over that

issue because we support the work of the contact group. The  contact group are acting as one. The whole Commonwealth supports  the group, so we are on a common position. I think that there is -. .  . /4

Q&A 4 8/10/81

Prime Minister(continued)

and I am not in any sense ...to explain or whatever the  United States' policies in relation to the Third World - but  there are some points that I think need to understood about this '  administration. I am not at all sure that the public perceptions ~ - and (inaudible) who is right or who is wrong, I accept that -  but I not at all sure that the public perceptions of this "  f

American administration are in any sense right in relation to  North/South issues. I believe there is an acceptance that the  East/west issues are interlinked with North/South issuesÂ« I believe .   there is an acceptance that grave social and economic injustices can

cause problems and tensions and difficulties which ... the potential  for dragging in participants in the East/West ... therefore blowing  up into a very difficult issue. Southern Africa plainly has that  particular potential. How many people here are aware that this  American administration's request for foreign aid to Congress - I

am not sure I know what Congress did with it - but at least the  Administration request to Congress was for an increase of 18%, the  same as the increase that we .. through our last Budget. That does not to me, sound like the attitude of an administration

that is hard-nosed,  cold, unsympathetic,  to the very real needs  of the Third World. I went to see President Reagan (inaudible)...  and President Lopez Portillo said in plain terms that Â·

President Reagan, he understands these issues. He has already .   agreed to participate with Mexico, Venezeula and Canada, and  (inaudible) ... Caribbean and Central Americas. How could a man Ã¢ÂÂ   - Â·ÃÂ§ÃÂ½..   accept that principle for that Central American region and not  accept that principle in the wider world? It is just not possible. ^  The United States' Administration I think, has been seeking to, " - ^ emphasise that it is not a question of aid,  it is not just a ÃÂ

question of what the World Bank might do. Maybe I could make this  point by telling you a story? there a noted European leader who  was not present in Melbourne, because he is not a member of  the Commonwealth. He was saying aid must be increased - he

belongs to a country with r a relatively good record for aid, as do  most Europeans - aid must be increased, we need to modify the  World Bank even further, the International Monetary Fund even  further, and I said,"yes, but what then happens when more countries

start to produce textiles, or electronic goods, or even motor cars,  are you going to allow any of them to be sold into your market". "Well, that is a matter that we will have to consider". I do not  believe the United States would agree with that answer, because  they know quite well - they believe in the private enterprise system

and in trade - we have got to make sure that the system works for  those who haVe not yet arrived, that.it is just not kept as a  preserve for those who have arrived. That has been part of  President Reagan's message. That is partly why he emphasises the  need for private capital, for trade flows. I mentioned if there _   were no barriers on the exports of agricultural goods from a ’  "

number of developing countries - "(inaudible) our agricultural  exports... take Australia out of the equation - over $30 billion Ã¢ÂÂ  more would be going to the developing countries. As I understand  the United States, they have been seeking to emphasise some of these

things. We would agree with them in relation to it, and in relation  to the role that trade and the private enterprise system, the

.. ./5

Q&A 5 8/10/81

(inaudible)... but that does not mean to say official development  assistance is not also important. The President of Mexico, said  "look, all this public perception of President Reagan is all quite  wrong. The only thing that mystifies me is why the Administration' '

allows it going on being accepted as being a part of their  sort of attitude", because it was the attitude that came through  when I met President Reagan, who was, again, if you like, contrary ,   to some public (inaudible) and pre-conceptions, was warm-hearted,

generous,  attentive to the people that he is talking with, and  responsive to what is being put, as I believe in a very real way?  and also worth noting that at the Ottawa Summit all countries  agreed even in a qualified way, to global negotiations, and having once

agreed even in a qualified way to global negotiations - and even if  they do not know exactly what is meant by global negotiations at  this point because it needs to be worked out - I think it then becomes  very difficult to retract from it - and so, that Ottawa Summit ’

itself (inaudible)... I have seen statements that the President has  made, or have been made on his behalf since, which would lend me  to believe - and it was Sonny Ramphal who showed me a statement that  he had from the President - led me to believe that the United States  would be going to the Cancun meeting in a positive frame of mind.

Now, whether I am right, whether your perceptions are right,  will, unfold in the next few days, in the next few weeks.  But. X  do not think, just as I have some degree of optimism in relation -   to Namibia, I am not pessimistic on these issues.  I hope '

Pierre Trudeau's prediction and suggestion that 1981 will become .   will become known as the year in which we really start to grapple"  with these problems in a more realistic way will in fact come  to be one of the landmarks through this century. Letrs look to .

the optimistic side for a change, and not always seek to (inaudible) ^  pessism.

Question -

Prime Minister (continued) '

First of all 1 would like to say that I __speaking on behalf of many Africans and developing countries if I were to say that many of  (inaudible) the world today....what I really want to ask is  what is your own reaction to the seeming inability of many Â·

Australians - ... media ... who ... your own ...

to sacrifice your own international .... more human world on the  altar of ... domestic ...

Prime Minister Â·

In Australian terms,  that is not a Dorothy-Dix either - an arranged  question. I thank you very much for that question and thank you  for what you have said. I have often been asked questions by the  Australian press - why. There is a certain (inaudible) cynicism .

in Australia which I suppose probably keeps a lot of us honest in "* Â·   our attitudes, but"why are you interested in these particular issues,  there is nothing in it Australians are not interested"? I just  do not accept that Australians are not interested. I have to say

it - and I hope I can say it without offence - I am not at all sure  that the headlines that have come out of Canberra depict the  attitude of Australians living in this city or the country towns  of this country.  If they did accurately, I would not have been in

Government for the last four or five years anyway. But, putting that  aside, I can remember somebody asking me "why".  I said, but surely  .. ./6

Q&A 6 8/10/81

Prime M i n i s t e r (continued)

you have seen the truth of the fact that Australians are  interested, because when the Kampuchea refugee problem was at  its height, many people in Australia opened a public appeal and  Governments obviously contributing to their own programmes for  those refugees, but ordinary Australians who make up this nation,  donated $12-$14 million out of their own,pockets for that  Kampuchean relief appeal - by far the largest appeal for any #

cause ever raised in Australia. If Australians are so utterly  uninterested about these issues, about the way in which people  live out their lives on this earth in different parts of the world,  why would they bother to give $12-$14 million out of their

pockets for the Kampuchean refugee relief appeal. They just ^would  not have done it. That really is in dollars and cents. The  answer to the attitude that Australians outside might be cynical  and unconcerned - they are concerned, they are interested. They  are much more interested than I suspect you might have gathered '

from reading some of the headlines. But even if I did not believe  they were concerned, on these particular issues, and on the question  of equality between peoples - of different colour, or of any  people for that matter - my own position is one in which I would

find it perfectly impossible to compromise at all. I use the  quotation of Jefferson's before the American war of independence  began,in which he said he would cease to exist before he would  yield to an association on such, terms. Well, those words could '  " "   have been used by any of the nationalist African leaders in the

last 30 to 40 years, or to Namibia today. It is the same struggle , for the right of people to determine itheir own futures, and that _is  something which is. beyond compromise. The question of apartheid,   or whatever happens in South Africa, I do not know how many '  ,  Australians understand - I think more now - the difference between x  discrimination as-a social fact, which is present in all countries

to some extent, and an attitude which I think most of us try'and  get rid of eradicate,  and laws are often designed to diminish its  impact or to reduce its influence - and how many people understand  the difference between thart and discrimination as it in South  Africa where it is enshrined in the law and enforced by the police

in ways that would have been barbaric from the (inaudible) century. It is quite different. Whatever the politics of it, they are not  just issues that, from my make-up, I would be able to compromise on. So thank you for your question, but I think really at heart you will find the overwhelming majority of Australian people are

not only familiar with these issues, but also with those of working for equality ana for the opportunity to lead out their  life with reasonable circumstances, with hope and optimism for the future.  6 .  .  .  .  .
