E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to say thank you to Bradnams for having me here today. Bradnams is Australia’s largest window  and glass door manufacturer. Bradnams use aluminium, they use glass, they use a lot of power and the price  of glass, aluminium and power is going to go up and up and up under the Prime Minister’s carbon tax. They  are going to be hit by the carbon tax and because Bradnams are going to be hit by the carbon tax all their  customers are going to be hit by the carbon tax and it’s because of the impact of the carbon tax on  businesses like Bradnams that the price of a modest new home will go up by $5,000 under Julia Gillard’s  toxic tax. Now, there are very heavy cost of living pressures on the forgotten families of Australia right now.  I say to the Prime Minister if she wants to do the right thing by the forgotten families of Australia she’ll drop  the toxic tax.

Now, the Prime Minister is coming up to the first anniversary of the reformation of the Government after the  election. This was supposed to be the year of decision and delivery. We’re two-thirds through the year of  decision and delivery and everything this Government touches it gets wrong. There is almost nothing that  this Government has got right over the last 12 months. It’s a bad government and it’s just getting worse and  worse as time goes by.

I note that today the Prime Minister is going to Auckland for the Pacific Islands Forum. If she’s serious  about continuing offshore processing she will talk to the Nauruan Government about reopening the centre  there. The Prime Minister should swallow her pride; she should admit that John Howard had it essentially  right on border protection and she should reopen the processing centre in Nauru. If she’s serious about  stopping the boats you’ve got to have offshore third country processing and the best place for that to happen  is Nauru. Don’t be too proud to talk to the President of Nauru at the Pacific Islands Forum.

Any questions?

QUESTION:

The poll, does this seal the Prime Minister’s fate?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not going to run a commentary on the polls. All I know is that this is a bad government getting worse. I  think the Australian people can see that it’s a bad government getting worse. One of the reasons why  confidence is so low at the moment is because people see that the Government doesn’t know what it’s doing  and when you’ve got an incompetent government in Canberra people lose confidence and the country goes  backwards.

QUESTION:

You made the offer yesterday about cooperating with the Government. Have you had any contact at all?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is no. The ball is in the Prime Minister’s court and I say to the Prime Minister if she thinks  there’s some legal doubt over the Government’s ability to process boat people offshore she should pick up  the phone, I’m happy to talk.

QUESTION:

Can you understand the scepticism of how cooperative you will be on this issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I don’t like the Malaysia people swap. That was a bad policy and it seems that now that the High  Court has spoken the Labor Party doesn’t like it either. The only person who still has a good word for the  Malaysia people swap is Chris Bowen and the Prime Minister herself. So I would respectfully say to the  Prime Minister do not persist with Malaysia, but there’s nothing wrong with Nauru, there’s nothing wrong  with Manus. Manus after all was not just John Howard’s policy but Manus was Julia Gillard’s policy and if  she wants to persist with it come and talk to us and we will be as constructive and cooperative as we can.

QUESTION:

Do you think there’s a message in this poll that could make the Prime Minister talk to you on the asylum  seeker deal?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the ball is in her court. It’s really up to her whether she’s prepared to swallow her pride; drop this  stubborn insistence on anywhere but Nauru; accept that John Howard got it essentially right and do what we  have to do to protect our borders. Now, what we can’t have is the current situation and the current situation  is that the Government has no border protection policy whatsoever. They put all their eggs in the Malaysia  and Manus basket. Malaysia is now definitely not doable under the High Court’s decision but Manus and  Nauru certainly are doable and if the Prime Minister wants third country offshore processing she just has to  pick up the phone.

QUESTION:

What’s the Coalition’s policy on unaccompanied children given potential legal advice that they won’t be  able to be sent offshore?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the fact that a decision is reviewable doesn’t mean that decisions can’t be made. You’ve just got to  make sure that the decisions have been made for the right reasons, on good grounds.

QUESTION:

This poll, do you think you could even possibly lose from now?

TONY ABBOTT:

I take nothing for granted. I think the Australian people are rightly critical of those who would lead our  country and I will be working very hard every day between now and the next election as will every member  of my team: first to expose the faults in a bad government and second to be a credible alternative. I think  what we are seeing is that increasingly the Australian people know there is a better way; that we can stop the  boats if we put a range of sensible policies in place; that we can get government spending under control if  we don’t go ahead be white elephants like the National Broadband Network; that we can have confidence  restored if the Government is prepared to drop things like the carbon tax and the mining tax.

QUESTION:

So are you reviewing your policy on unaccompanied children?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, there is no reason why you can’t do something as long as it’s being done on good grounds and for  the right reasons.

QUESTION:

You have made a public offer to cooperate over the asylum seeker issue. Did any of your office actually  contact them directly?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ve made my position absolutely crystal clear and the ball is now in the Prime Minister’s court.

QUESTION:

Would you accept a solution with Malaysia and Nauru [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I want to make is that no-one likes Malaysia now, except Chris Bowen and Julia Gillard. Malaysia  has been demonstrated to be pretty ineffective. Let’s face it, I think we’ve had something like 12 boats and  close to 400 people arrive since Malaysia was announced. We’ve had more boats and more people arrive  since the Malaysia deal was signed and now of course the High Court has said that it’s really impossible  because there aren’t the sorts of guarantees in Malaysia of the kind of treatment that Australians would  regard as the minimum necessary.

QUESTION:

Are you still in contact with the independents? Are they starting to get edgy with these polls declining?

TONY ABBOTT:

I will let other people speak for themselves. I try to have a civil and courteous relationship with all members  of parliament who want to talk to me.

QUESTION:

The New South Wales Budget, the Government there is going increase mining royalties. Do you think it  should be punished for that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that what the state governments do with royalties is a matter for them. Mining royalties are a state  tax. I think it’s important that we respect the fact that royalties are a state tax. I think as far as possible states  should be encouraged to raise revenue from their own sources for their own activities and I am sure that  Barry O’Farrell and Mike Baird will do a very good and responsible job with the New South Wales Budget.

QUESTION:

But doesn’t the Federal Government have to compensate?

TONY ABBOTT:

The Federal Government put in place a certain set arrangements and those arrangements are wholly and  solely the responsibility of the Federal Government. If they did a bad deal, well, be it on their heads. But the  point I make is that the state governments are responsible for mining royalties and it’s up to them what they  do with them.

Thank you.
