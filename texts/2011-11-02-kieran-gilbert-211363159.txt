TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SKY NEWS PM AGENDA WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SUBJECT: INDONESIAN BOAT TRAGEDY; QANTAS; MRRT; INTEREST RATES;  GLOBAL ECONOMY.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Minister thanks very much for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.

JOURNALIST: The Opposition Leader has criticised your colleague Brendan O’Connor for  politicising the tragic drowning of asylum seekers off Java. Was it inappropriate for Mr  O’Connor to raise the politics around the Malaysia deal as the search for the missing is still  going?

WONG: Tony Abbott’s accusing someone of politicising the asylum seeker issue? I mean,  let’s be frank. This is the man who, not that I’m in the House, I’m a Senator, but as I  understand has just blown the proceedings up again, yet again, in the House of  Representatives because he wants a debate on migration.

Mr Abbott is in no position to lecture anybody about politicising this issue. That is all that he  has done. He has never offered a solution. He has indicated he would vote with the Greens  to prevent the government putting its proposal forward, and he has does nothing except talk  about slogans. And he also had the boat phone, I forgot that.

JOURNALIST: Mr Abbott did call on, in that motion to suspend standing orders today, he  called on the Government to bring the Malaysia deal to a vote. Why not? The Minister says,  Minister O’Connor, he was predicting more tragedies, more fatalities at sea if there isn’t the  strongest deterrent. If you believe this is the strongest deterrent, why not bring it to a vote?

WONG: Tony Abbott is demanding, jumping up and down and yelling and demanding, that  a bill be brought forward that he wants to vote against. Let’s be clear. This is the sum total  of this man’s contribution as a national political leader to public debate, is to say he wants a  vote that he can vote no on. This is not a serious proposition.

If Tony Abbott wants to seriously engage with the Government, if he wants to say ‘no I will  not vote with the Greens to stop offshore processing something I say I believe in,’ then we  have said we will bring that on. But he’s not saying that. He’s saying bring the vote on so I  can vote no.

JOURNALIST: But the bottom line is that this is happening on your watch. This, another  boat last night, the tragedy off Java. The Minister, or the Government, believes that that  boat was heading to Australia. So it’s on your watch, this is happening.

WONG: It is a tragedy. And this is the sort of tragedy we don’t want to happen. Which is the  motivation for the Government putting in place, getting the agreement with Malaysia and  saying to the Parliament we want to put this in place. This is precisely the thing that we  wanted to avoid.

JOURNALIST: On Qantas, the Government’s been making a lot of Joe Hockey’s  comments, that he was advised that Qantas was saying publicly and privately around the  House for weeks that a grounding was possible. Isn’t the substance of this debate really  about when and what the Government did? Particularly when Qantas said that it would’ve  grounded the fleet, it would not have grounded the fleet, if she had acted under section 431  and the terminated the strikes immediately.

WONG: Let’s be clear about what occurred on Saturday. What occurred on Saturday was  the employer gave notice that every single employee would be locked out. Every pilot,  every baggage handler, every flight attendant, everybody who does your luggage - they  would all be locked out. And that would result in the grounding of the entire fleet. Now Alan  Joyce has made clear that the lockout of the entire workforce leading to the grounding of  the fleet, was not something prior to the Saturday that the Government was given notice of.  But what is interesting, is Joe Hockey on television last night dodging the question getting  somewhat, if I might say, melting somewhat under the pressure. And he had some pretty  significant questions to answer - did he ever know ahead of Saturday about the prospect of  a lockout?

JOURNALIST: But isn’t this just to confuse the situation? Because it’s what the  Government knew, what you did, and whether or not you could have stopped the grounding  in the first place, which is what Qantas said basically you could’ve done.

WONG: I don’t agree with your characterisation of what Qantas said. But what I will say is,  we took immediate action - action that was successful, action under the part of the Act that  we were advised would be most likely to lead to success. And it did, end of story. So none  of that really can be disputed. The planes are back in the air and the Government took  immediate action to ensure that that occurred. What is not clear is the extent to which Joe  Hockey knew ahead of time about what is quite an extreme escalation of this industrial  dispute, which was the lockout of the entire workforce.

JOURNALIST: Some of your colleagues, Doug Cameron, a Labor Senator, also Ed Husic  the backbencher, believe that the Government needs to look at the Fair Work Act and  maybe strengthen it so companies, quote, ‘can’t abuse the law like Qantas did.’

WONG: I think that we’ve got the balance right in the Fair Work Act.

JOURNALIST: Your colleagues don’t.

WONG: People are entitled to put their views, but I think we do have the balance right. But  that ultimately will be a matter for Senator Evans who is the Minister in charge of that Act.  But I do say this - in relation to the Qantas dispute, it really is time for everybody involved in  that, every leader, whether they’re union or business to act like adults and to resolve it.  That’s what the Government expects, and more importantly, I think that’s what the  Australian community expects. That’s what their customers expect, to resolve the dispute.

JOURNALIST: On the mining tax, is there scope to tweak the legislation? I spoke to  Andrew Wilkie. He wants changes to the way the smaller miners are treated. Is there room  for tweaking that law?

WONG: There are already provisions in the legislation and in this scheme which recognise  the position of small miners. What is important here is the national interest and what is  important here is trying to spread the benefits of the boom. Australians understand mining  is important. But they also understand you only dig these resources up once. We’ve got an  opportunity here to build for the future, to lock in more prosperity for our children, and we all  should look to that.

JOURNALIST: You say provisions are in the bills, but its obviously not pleasing Andrew  Wilkie. He wants more. Will the government tweak those bills?

WONG: The Treasurer is in dialogue with the crossbenchers in order to get this legislation  through. Of course the reason we are in dialogue with the crossbenchers to get the  legislation through is yet again - surprise, surprise - Tony Abbott is saying no. He wants  miners to pay less tax, he wants small business to pay more, manufacturers to pay more.  And he’s opposed to superannuation increases for working Australians. I mean how is that  good for working people?

JOURNALIST: You’re the Finance Minister, you need to control spending. But obviously  you need to find some money to pay for, to accommodate Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott.  They want millions, hundreds of millions more, spent on environmental research when it  comes to coal seam gas. Does that worry you?

WONG: I understand that we need to have these discussions with individuals to get things  through the Parliament. But the Government’s not going to be shifting from its fiscal  strategy, and the Government’s laid out what is a very comprehensive set of policies as a  result of the mining tax, which are about strengthening the economy and delivering for small  business, for companies and also for working Australians.

JOURNALIST: But you will have to spend more here to get those MPs across the line.

WONG: I’m not going to have this discussion via television. What I would say to them is  there is a bigger principle here, an important principle, which is, let’s use the benefits of the  boom, the mining boom, for the benefit of all Australians.

JOURNALIST: On interest rates, the National Australia Bank has not passed on the full cut.  Mr Swan says it’s a kick in the guts from NAB. The bank says customers will today still

benefit from having the lowest standard variable rate of any of the four major banks. So  they’re coming from a lower base. Are you being too harsh on that bank?

WONG: No, not at all. I mean the NAB recorded a very significant profit recently. We don’t  think any bank has the excuse in this current environment not to pass on the full interest  rate cut. And it is extremely disappointing that the NAB has chosen not to.

JOURNALIST: But they still have the lowest rate, the lowest variable rate.

WONG: I’ll leave it to the NAB to put their position. We think all the banks should have  passed on the full rate cut. And we applaud Westpac, the Commonwealth, ANZ, Bank of  Queensland and others who are doing so. And they’re doing the right thing by their  customers.

JOURNALIST: The Greek cabinet has backed the Prime Minister’s referendum decision.  But the markets are in a panic, his government’s on the verge of collapse. The good news  story out of the Eurozone hasn’t lasted long.

WONG: Well this is a very disappointing set of developments in Greece, and what we  should again emphasize is that Europe needs to resolve this. Europe does need to resolve  this because global markets demand that its resolved.  And there are significant  consequences if its not. It’s obviously very important that the Prime Minister will be  attending the G20 where no doubt these and other issues will be raised. But as I’ve said to  you before on your program, let’s remember we have a lot of underlying strength in our  economy. And we can make it even stronger with the passage of the minerals tax.

JOURNALIST: But it shows this is far from over in the Eurozone with Greece teetering -

WONG: And I said to you I think previously after this occurred that, after the Europeans  came to their agreement, that the important thing was the implementation. And they’ve  obviously got some work to do. But I think many of the significant European economies  understand the importance of resolution.

JOURNALIST: Minister thanks for your time.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
