CHRIS EVANS INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SPEERS  FRIDAY 13 NOVEMBER 2009

SPEERS:

I want to ask you about the developments at the moment on the Oceanic Viking. What’s the  latest information you have about any asylum seekers that have agreed to disembark?

EVANS:

Well we’re hopeful of seeing some people disembark. We’re working with the group. Some  have indicated they’re likely to come off but of course until we actually get people off we’re  not going to be making any comment about numbers or the specifics.

SPEERS:

But about twenty is what you expect to disembark?

EVANS:

No, as I say we’re not making any comment about the numbers. We’ve been talking with the  group and we’re hopeful that some will start to come off soon. I don’t expect them to all  come off at once but we’ll hopefully see some movement in the next day or so.

SPEERS:

Alright, but the offer that has been made to them by the Australian Government as the Prime  Minister confirmed today is that they will be resettled within six to twelve weeks. Now that’s  not just processed but resettled were Kevin Rudd’s words, so have you, has the Government  discussed with other countries where they might be resettled or is the reality that Australia  will take the bulk?

EVANS:

Look the reality is that we’ve got the normal UNHCR resettlement processes. They will be  assessed as to whether or not they’re refugees. Once that happens the UNHCR then if you  like recommends them or refers them to settlement countries. We have traditionally taken the  bulk out of Indonesia but Canada, New Zealand, some of the [inaudible] countries have taken  a few. I’d expect that sort of pattern to be evident dealing with this group as well. But until  you’ve had the proper interviews, ‘til you know whether they might have relatives or what  have you, that won’t be clear. But I’d expect us to be taking the larger proportion of the  group.

SPEERS:

But people who are found to be refugees in Indonesia aren’t often resettled in a twelve-week,  so to make this guarantee, to make this offer, there must be some sort of surety that either  Australia or other countries are going to take them that quickly.

EVANS:

Sure, look we’ve had discussions with other countries but we’ve been negotiating with the  UNHCR and Indonesia. What we did is we put in writing, we codified what we think the  arrangements that we could deliver on were. So people obviously want to know what would  happen if they got off the boat. We tell them these are the normal processes, we’d be able to  meet these timeframes, and if you come off the boat that’s how you’ll be treated. It’s not a  deal but it’s a recognition that they now understand what happens if they come off the boat.

SPEERS:

So if Canada or New Zealand or other countries can’t be found within twelve weeks, if they  come off the boat, Australia presumably will take them to meet that guarantee?

EVANS:

Well as I say to you it will depend in part on who the UNHCR wants to refer people to. If for  instance they’ve got a first cousin living in Canada and the best settlement option is for  Canada then they’ll refer them there first. But certainly we’ve spoken to some of the  settlement countries, but I’ve also made it clear that we’re more likely to get the larger  proportion of them because that’s part of our burden-sharing arrangement with Indonesia.  We’re trying to develop a closer relationship with them so you get outcomes in Indonesia for  protracted cases. We’ve taken the largest group in the past under both the Howard

Government and under this government and that will continue with this group. But the  normal processes are applying. All we’ve done is lay out for them what the timeframes will  be.

SPEERS:

But you say the normal processes are applying here and you’re obviously keen to play down  suggestions this is a special deal, but you know that people in detention in Indonesia don’t get  processed usually that fast, and people who are found to be refugees aren’t resettled that fast.  This is special treatment isn’t it?

EVANS:

No, what we’ve done is since we came into government we’ve actually been working with  the Indonesians to deal with their protracted caseload. People have been waiting too long in  Indonesia for settlement. The Indonesians have been concerned about that, and so we started  dealing with their protracted caseload a year-and-a-half or so ago, and New Zealand have  taken some, Canada have taken some, we’ve taken some, but we’ve been trying to work to a  system that will allow people to be settled more quickly. Now what we’ve said is we’ve  interviewed people on the boat, we’ve got a reasonable understanding of who they are, some  have already been found to be refugees, and we’ve indicated to them that we think settlement  would occur within that sort of timeframe so that they knew what would happen to them if  they got off the boat.

SPEERS:

Are you extending this offer to other asylum seekers in Indonesia? There’s another sixty or  seventy-odd in the Tanjung Pinang detention centre. Are they being told they’ve got the same  process here or is this just for those on board the Oceanic Viking?

EVANS:

No they’ve been going through the UNHCR processes and assessment of those people inside  that detention centre, and the UNHCR may or may not refer them to us or other countries  depending on those assessments. The timelines are not firm in any of this but what we did do  was indicate to those people on the boat, in writing, what we thought we could do in terms of

their timeframes.  And obviously they vary between groups.

We’re not even sure yet that all the people on the boat will be found to be asylum seekers.  So  we made it clear to them, they’ll have to put their claims, be assessed but that we will provide  those sorts of processes, the normal processes, and a timeframe to try and get them to come

off the boat.

SPEERS:

Clearly the key here is enticing them to get off the boat with the offer of resettling them  within 12 weeks and that is not something…that is not a timeframe you’re offering others in  detention in Indonesia.

EVANS:

Well we have 90 day timeframe for processing on Christmas Island.  We don’t always meet  it…

SPEERS:

…but this is Indonesia…

EVANS:

…that’s right…

SPEERS:

…they’re going into a detention centre in Indonesia.

EVANS:

Yes, well what’s happening is clearly the normal process.  They go into a detention centre in  Indonesia, they’re assessed by the UNHCR and we’ve given them a timeframe in which those  processes will occur.  Now, that’s the basis on which they have been assured that if they get  off the boat they will be treated properly.  But we’re very determined to get them to  disembark in Indonesia and we’re very determined for the normal processes to apply and  that’s what we hope will happen over the next few days.

SPEERS:

But Minister this is not normal.  This is not what you’re offering other asylum seekers in that  same detention centre.

EVANS:

It’s not a normal circumstance, that’s true.  I mean we went out and rescued at sea a boat that  was sinking in Indonesian search and rescue area.  We followed international law and took  those persons to Indonesia.  We’ve had an agreement with the Indonesians they will  disembark there and this has become a protracted situation because those people were very  opposed to getting offloaded in Indonesia.  We have said to them well that’s the agreement

with the Indonesians, that’s where you need to disembark.  But we laid out for them how we  thought we could process them after discussions with the Indonesians and the UNHCR.  It’s  perfectly proper process, it’s the normal processing but we have set timelines, that’s true, but  that’s part of trying to negotiate a settlement but we’re very firm.  They need to come off in  Indonesia and they ought to come off soon and we’ll just have to see how that pans out.

SPEERS:

But all I’m getting at is when you say this is part of the negotiation to deal with a special set  of circumstances you are offering them a special deal, something you’re not offering others.

EVANS:

Well we’ve set a timeframe but the deal is the same as any other refugee - detention,  followed by assessment by UNHCR, followed by referral to settlement countries.  There’s no  guarantee of resettlement in Australia and there’s certainly no guarantee of the sort of  nonsense Malcolm Turnbull’s been talking about as if there’s jobs etc.

SPEERS:

But the timeframe is the special part. The timeframe - at 12 weeks you’ll be resettled - that is  a special deal.

EVANS:

Well we laid out after interviewing them what we thought could be achieved, that’s right,  which is we thought these timeframes were possible in terms of dealing with that group.  The  Indonesians are very keen for us to deal with the group quickly, they’re very keen for us to  have protocols in place more generally and we’ve been working on speeding up the  processing in Indonesia.  That’s part of what the Prime Minister’s been talking to the  President about.  That’s part of the ongoing development of anti-people smuggling and  assessment processes and we think this is an appropriate response in order to get people to  disembark in Indonesia as they should.

SPEERS:

Okay because the Opposition’s argument is that by offering them special treatment you are  rewarding their behaviour over the past four weeks and running up the flag that if you behave  like this you will get a fast-tracked deal.

EVANS:

That’s nonsense.  We are dealing with a particularly specific, difficult situation.  They were  found in Indonesian waters.  We’ve taken them to Indonesia.  We have an agreement with the  Indonesians about disembarking them there.  It is a special circumstance.  The message we’ve

sent to people smugglers has been very clear, that we’re working very hard with the  Indonesians to try and combat people smuggling and the interception of that boat at Merak  and the fact that they were intercepted by the Indonesians and are still in the port there  indicates the signal we are sending in the region, that we’re very determined to stamp out  people smuggling.

SPEERS:

And a final question Minister.  Malcolm Turnbull today confirming, as you indicated, that he  wants to bring back temporary protection visas or he’s calling them safe haven visas.  Is it a  logical proposition for people who are considering whether to come to Australia or try to seek

refuge somewhere else that if there is a permanent visa on offer in Australia it’s going to be  more attractive than a temporary visa?

EVANS:

Well what we know about temporary protection visas, we’ve had the experience, you can  actually look at the record.  And under John Howard, he tried this, in the two years following  the TPVs we had 9,000 people arrive.  So it didn’t stop people coming and then they stayed,  no one left.

About three per cent of people came of the 11,000 who were given TPVs became permanent  residence and then became citizens.  So what we know about this policy is it doesn’t stop  people coming and when they come they stay.  So it’s a nonsense, it’s not a policy, it’s a

couple of dot points and already the Liberals are in disarray as people reject his going back to  TPVs.

You might recall when we abolished them they didn’t oppose it but now they’re desperate for  some sort of policy response and all we got was four dot points.  But TPVs didn’t work.  We  know more people came and no one went home under them.  So the record of TPVs is well  established, it’s failed policy.

SPEERS:

We’ll have to leave it there.  Thanks very much for joining us.
