E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m very pleased to be here with a very enthusiastic West Australian Liberal Parliamentary team led by my  Deputy, Julie Bishop, to talk about the government’s consistent failures when it comes to border protection.

Ten weeks ago, I launched this mobile billboard to highlight the consistent failures of the Rudd/Gillard  government. Then, there were 112 boats that had arrived. In just ten weeks, we’ve had another 31 boats,  more than 1,500 people. That’s more than three boats a week since this billboard was launched.

Under the Howard government, there were three boats a year, under the Rudd/Gillard government, there  have been more than three boats a week and when she was the Shadow Minister for Immigration, Julia  Gillard used to say ‘another boat, another policy failure’. She didn’t say it very often under the Howard  government, she only got to say it three times a year. Under the Rudd/Gillard government ‘another boat,  another policy failure’ is a mantra that gets repeated three times a week and even more often recently.

So, it really is incumbent upon the new Prime Minister to solve this problem. All we’ve had from her so far  is talk. She talks a good game, but can she deliver? When it comes to the boats, you just can’t trust Labor.  You just can’t trust Prime Minister Gillard to sort out the problem that she helped to create as Deputy Prime  Minister Gillard.

The problem in the end is that you just can’t trust the Labor Party with an issue like this. If you re-elect the  government, it’s for sure that the boats will just keep coming.

So, I have a very simple message to the Australian people. If you want to stop the boats, you’ve got to  change the government. If you want to stop the tax, you’ve got to change the government. It’s not enough to  change the leader, you’ve got to change the government if you want to stop the boats.

Now, I’m going to ask Julie to say a few words and then we might have some questions.

JULIE BISHOP:

As Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I welcome Tony Abbott to my electorate of Curtin and to the great  state of Western Australia. Tony Abbott has been a tireless defender of the Western Australian economy and  the interests of all Western Australians. Tony stood up against the Gillard/Rudd emissions trading scheme  which would have devastated our economy here in the West. Tony fought against the Rudd/Gillard mining  tax which would have decimated the growth in our mining sector and Tony has exposed the failings in the  Gillard/Rudd border protection policy.

Now, Julia Gillard admitted that she was the architect, she was the author, she was the drafter of Labor’s  border protection policy which has failed so monumentally. So Julia Gillard was the person who put the  people smuggling trade back into business. For the last two years or more, Julia Gillard’s been saying that  their border protection policy was right, just as she’s been saying that their emissions trading scheme was  right, just as she said their original mining tax was right. Now Julia Gillard’s doing backflips. So, either she  didn’t believe what she was saying then, or she doesn’t believe what she’s saying now.

As recently as two weeks ago, Julia Gillard said that they had their border protection policy right. Well, if  she announces a backflip, it means we can’t believe what she says. So, any commitment that Julia Gillard  gives to the Australian people can’t be believed. She either didn’t believe it then or she doesn’t believe it  now. That’s why we need a change of government.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well said, Julie. Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

Is border protection going to be your main area of focus in your election fight?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s certainly going to be an important election issue. Julia Gillard has been saying for the last few days that  this is the next issue that she wants to deal with and I challenge her to deal with it by adopting the  Coalition’s policies. Only the Coalition knows how to stop the boats. We know how to stop the boats  because we’ve done it before and we can do it again and if she’s fair dinkum about stopping the boats, well,  she should adopt our policies.

QUESTION:

What would you do differently to stop them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, first of all you’ve got to be prepared under the right circumstances to turn boats around. You’ve got to  have rigorous offshore processing and that means, if possible, in third countries and finally and very, very  importantly, you’ve got to deny the people smugglers a product to sell and that means bringing back  temporary protection visas and I note that this critical part of any effective policy was ruled out today by the  Minister for Population.

QUESTION:

What are the physical practicalities of actually turning these boats around? How will you do this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not going to go into the sort of operational details but it has been done by Australia in the past. It  was done up to a half a dozen times by the Howard government and it can be done again.

QUESTION:

But where do they go once you’ve turned them back?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it was done by the Howard government and it can be done again with the right policies in place.

QUESTION:

On the mining tax, do you support Colin Barnett’s view that it could be unconstitutional because it’s taxing  the resource which belongs to the States?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I am certain that the Premier has strong legal advice to that effect and it’s entirely appropriate for the  Premier to do whatever is necessary to protect Western Australia’s economy. But, in the end, the best way to  stop the tax is to change the government. The best way to stop the tax is through the ballot box and that is  the best way and I urge West Australians and all Australians to stop this damaging tax by voting out the  Gillard/Rudd government. It’s very important that we change the government because even though this  government has now changed the tax, it’s still a great big bad tax and you can’t trust Labor not to change it  again, make it even worse, if they’re re-elected.

Now, one of the things that the public should be very concerned about is the figures that we’ve got from this  government. I’m not accusing the government of cooking the books, but I’ve got to say these figures are  very fishy. How is it that they can raise the threshold, lower the rate and reduce the incidence and still raise  almost as much money? We know that their figures are often wrong. We know that there were all sorts of  figures in the Budget papers that needed to be looked at again such as the pie charts which turned out not to  be Treasury charts but Wayne Swan’s office charts and I think that the best way to resolve this issue of just  who is paying what and just how much money is really going to be raised is for the government to release all  the figures, all the modelling for the old tax and for the new tax and until they’re prepared to do that, a lot of  people just won’t believe them.

QUESTION:

Woodside put out a statement today welcoming the tax. Don’t you risk standing without support of the  majority of the major players in the mining industry?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I want to protect the mining and resources sector from a great big new tax on their competitiveness.  Now, if the government is right, someone is paying $10.5 billion more and the people who will be paying  $10.5 billion more in the first instance are our mining companies, but in the second instance, it’s the workers  in the mining sector and in the third instance, it’s all Australians who will be paying for this because there  will be less investment and less jobs.

QUESTION:

Do you think Julia Gillard will move to the Right on asylum seekers and try and wedge you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I would welcome her adopting our policies but I think on the record so far, what we’ll see from this  Prime Minister is a lot of talk but no different action. I mean, she will tell people what she thinks they want  to hear but she won’t deliver the policies that will really make a difference. The only way to make a  difference is to change the government. It’s as simple as that.

QUESTION:

Can you give us any more details about the border protection policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we’ve already released a lot of detail and you’ll certainly see more from us in the run-up to polling day  but I would stress that the Coalition has form here. We have a record. There were boats coming and the  former government stopped them. The former government knew how to deal with this. The Coalition knows  how to deal with this. We will stop the boats and Labor can’t.

QUESTION:

Stephen Smith came out yesterday to comment on the mining tax. Do you think Labor’s feeling the pressure  here in WA?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the government realises that the mining tax has done them enormous damage right around  Australia. I think the mining tax more than anything else has crystallised people’s doubts about whether  Labor can be trusted with the economy. They are desperately trying to pretend that the issue has been  resolved. It has not been resolved. If this was an economic disaster raising $12 billion, it’s just as big an  economic disaster raising $10.5 billion and that’s one of the many reasons why they really do have to  publish all the modelling, all the figures. They’ve got to open their books to the Australian people.

Thank you.
