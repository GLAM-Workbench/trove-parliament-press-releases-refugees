17 May 2012

SCOTT BEVAN: Richard Marles is the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs  and he’s been visiting Solomon Islands this week and Richard Marles joins me now on the  phone from the Solomon Islands capital, Honiara.

Richard Marles, thanks very much for your time tonight.

Australia has been contributing people as well as other resources to RAMSI, the Regional  Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, for almost a decade. We've had Federal Police in  the Solomons for longer than that. How much longer will that contribution have to continue  for?

RICHARD MARLES: It’s a good question, Scott, and I think that we're certainly closer to  the end than the beginning and much closer to the end.

The point to note up front is that the advances we've seen in Solomon Islands as a result of  the RAMSI mission have been absolutely wonderful. It is, I think, the signature achievement  of the Pacific region.

This is not just an Australian engagement in the Solomon Islands. It’s a Pacific region  engagement in the Solomon Islands. This is a country which was in a state of chaos and  anarchy back in 2003 and is now a place where there is law and order in the streets. We've

seen pretty consistent economic growth since RAMSI came into being and this is now a  country which is on the move and on the move forward.

So a lot of ground has been gained.

Tomorrow’s ministerial meeting, RAMSI ministerial meeting, will look at exactly the  question that you've asked and that is where to from here given the advances that have been  made?

The answer is that in terms of the security environment, there is a longer role to be played by  the police. In terms of the military, there is now a live question about the timing of when the  military should finish and that’s something which has been discussed.

Having said that, the military will be here for at least another year.

There’s also a question around the civil side of the RAMSI mission, the development  assistance side, and how we can do that in a way which transitions to a more normal bilateral  aid relationship with the Solomons.

SCOTT BEVAN: That term you've just used there, this transitioning to a more normal  bilateral relationship, in this instance what do you think more normal will look like in this  relationship?

RICHARD MARLES: I think RAMSI will have a legacy in terms of Australia’s ongoing  relationship with the Solomon Islands for a fair time to come. But Solomon Islands is a very  important country within the region. There are many development challenges here and there  is going to be a considerable development assistance program that we'll continue in the  Solomons long after RAMSI has completed.

That’s why we use the word transition. It’s not as though Australia is about to leave the  Solomons. Australia is deeply engaged in all the countries of the Pacific and we will remain  deeply engaged in the Solomons. But it is about looking at a way in which we can have that  in a more normal relationship.

One of the critical parts of that, Scott, is that at the moment the very nature of RAMSI, even  in relation to the development assistance side of it, is on a kind of short term basis.

With a bilateral aid program, we're able to do development assistance over the long term and  that’s really to the benefit of the Solomon Islands and an important part of the transition that  needs to take place.

SCOTT BEVAN: Australia is the largest aid donor to the Solomons, this financial year  about $240 million. Does that substantial financial commitment as an aid donor, is that likely  to continue into the foreseeable future as part of this transition you're talking about?

RICHARD MARLES: It’s hard to speculate in terms of the quantum. What we will see is  the bilateral component will rise. It has risen this year from $60 million to $70 million but the  point you raise is in relation to the overall commitment, including RAMSI, to Solomon  Islands, it is hard to speculate on that. We need to continue here until the task is done but,

having said that, it does make sense to transition into more of a bilateral relationship and  they're the kind of issues we'll be talking about tomorrow.

SCOTT BEVAN: Mr Marles, on this tour you also visited Nauru, meeting leaders there.  What discussions were held about the possibility of reopening the asylum-seeker processing  centre there?

RICHARD MARLES: That’s obviously the first question that I'm asked whenever I have  any contact with Nauru. It might surprise you, Scott, to know that we didn't mention it once.

SCOTT BEVAN: Not once?

RICHARD MARLES: Not once. There are many issues Nauru is facing and we have an  ongoing relationship with Nauru, quite apart from anything to do with asylum-seeker  processing centres.

We've got to remember, Nauru is one of two countries which have gained their independence  from Australia, along with Papua New Guinea. So Nauru holds a pretty special and unique  place in our world view. As a result of that, we have a substantial development assistance  program to Nauru which rose considerably in the last Budget from $18 million to $23 million  in terms of the bilateral aid program. I think that is about a 30 per cent increase.

We've also extended the seasonal workers program to include Nauru and that’s a really  important opportunity for Nauru to gain much needed financial or foreign currency being  remitted back to Nauru.

So these are big issues. As well, there are considerations about the future of Nauru. I mean,  there is phosphate mining going on at the moment, it’s secondary mining. With fisheries,  there are some real advances in terms of the revenue that’s being brought in.

And this was a really good opportunity to talk through all of those issues and look to the long  term of our relationship with Nauru.

SCOTT BEVAN: Talking of the long term and you also mentioned some of the resources  there in these resource-rich areas. With the broader geopolitical interest of these areas, for  example relationships with the two Chinas, how important do you foresee it, that Australia  maintains these bilateral relations to keep us very much in the game in the face of increasing  interest, increasing geopolitical interest from other parts of the region?

RICHARD MARLES: I think the Pacific holds a very important place in Australia’s world  view. It’s our neighbourhood, it’s always going to be our neighbourhood and so we have a  deep interest in it. But, it actually goes a bit beyond that. I think the rest of the world looks to  Australia as having a particular role in the Pacific. I think for good or for ill we will rightly be  judged on the way in which we behave within the Pacific. So what we do here goes a lot to  our global reputation. That’s why, along with wanting to do the right thing in the Pacific, it is  so important that we are engaged here for our long term national interest.

Because we have a deep interest in the Pacific for all those reasons, I think that far outweighs  any anxieties about other powers coming into the Pacific.

Frankly, the Pacific’s a hard place in which to do development assistance work. If there are  countries out there willing to share some of that work then we welcome them with open arms.

Our only point in relation to that is we would like to do that cooperatively which is what the  Cairns Compact around development assistance is all about. It’s a program or a framework, if  you like, through which countries can coordinate their development assistance in the Pacific.  That’s something that we would ask of any country who was seeking to work here.

But, you know, we don't feel that we have any exclusive right to the Pacific. That’s not how  we look at it. The Pacific is important to us in its own terms. I think we've just got to make  sure that we're being the very best friend that we can be to this region.

SCOTT BEVAN: Richard Marles, the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs in  Foreign Affairs, thanks very much for speaking with us on the phone from Honiara.

RICHARD MARLES: Thank you.
