TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, LAKESIDE HOTEL CANBERRA

Topics: WA industrial strike;

E & O E : ..................................................................................................................................................

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, can we expect nationwide strikes under a Coalition Government?

HOWARD:

No.

JOURNALIST:

Do you support the second wave o f policies from the WA Government?

HOWARD:

I condemn the Prime Minister for provoking industrial unrest in Western Australia. The Prime  Minister has abdicated his responsibility as a national leader. He didn't even have the guts this  morning on AM to take sides. I mean, he said, I neither endorse it nor disendorse it. He's the  Prime Minister. He's got a responsibility to have a view and there are 1.3 million Australians who  are being deprived o f essential services, in some cases of the availability o f food. Australians are

suffering deliberately at the whim o f the TLC in Western Australia. The Prime Minister started off  by encouraging the strike. He started off with the help of Laurie Brereton and Kim Beazley o f  encouraging the strike. He now is retreating at a hundred miles an hour but he's retreated at a  hundred miles an hour to the barbed wire fence, and he's sitting there and saying, ooh, I don't even  know it's going on, ooh, it's not my responsibility.

I mean, he's the Prime Minister. The welfare of Australians is always the  responsibility of the Prime Minister, whether he's a Labor Prime Minister or a  Liberal Prime Minister and I haven't heard a worse abdication of the  responsibilities of the job from any occupant than I heard from Paul Keating  this morning. To go on air and say, "I neither endorse nor disendorse a union-  implemented but politically inspired blockade of a state", is a total abdication

of his responsibilities and an illustration of how he's losing his grip and he's lost  sight of what the responsibilities of the office properly involve.

JOURNALIST:

What about the recall o f Don Russell?

HOWARD:

Well, I think he's panicking.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, will a Coalition Government reconsider a GST?

HOWARD:

Naah!

JOURNALIST:

What was Kevin Andrews on about then?

HOWARD:

(Inaudible)

JOURNALIST:

Will he be reprimanded?

HOWARD:

Oh, look, it's irrelevant.
