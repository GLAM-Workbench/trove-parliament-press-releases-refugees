It’s time to leave Nauru: Greens

It is time for Australia to abandon its ill-fated policy of refugee resettlement on Nauru, the  Australian Greens have said, as a threatening letter has been sent from Nauruan locals to  refugees resettled on the island.

“The refugees are not safe on Nauru,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.

“The Immigration Minister is actively dumping these people, including families and children, in  harm’s way.

“The Abbott government must give up on its ill-fated policy of offshore resettlement. There is no  life for these refugees on Nauru.

“This is not a sustainable, lasting solution and I fear that, as the tensions increase, a serious  tragedy is inevitable.

“It’s time to get these people off of Nauru, before it’s too late.”
