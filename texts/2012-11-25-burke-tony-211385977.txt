BARRY CASSIDY:    Now to our studio guest, the Environment Minister Tony Burke. And  while he joins us, letâ€™s have a look at some of the mixed reaction to the  Murray Darling Basin Plan.

BARRY CASSIDY:    Minister, good morning. Welcome.

TONY BURKE:        Good morning Barry.

BARRY CASSIDY:    You've described the plan as arriving a century late but hopefully just in  time - hopefully. Does that suggest something can still go wrong?

TONY BURKE:        No, what it suggests is what we saw over the last 20 years, ever since  that blue green algae outbreak in 1991, was some areas of the Basin  will have undergone permanent change. There are some species that  disappeared from the Coorong during the last drought that, even  though we've had good rain, still haven't been seen to return.

So when you've run a river system as hard as the Murray Darling  Basin's been run, it's not a situation where you can just wait for it to  rain, it all looks the same and the ecology is straight back there. You do  get permanent changes.

When I say hopefully just in time it's that this time we've had good rain  now. If we get moving it means we'll start to be prepared for the next  drought in a much more effective way than we have been for decades.

BARRY CASSIDY:    So can you give guarantees? Will the situation - you're saying it won't  get any worse or it will actually - it can actually get better?

TONY BURKE:        It can get better and significantly better. What happens with the reform  - people say well, you don't get all the water until 2024 - and that's  true. But on the number in the plan we're halfway there now on what's  contracted. There's a thousand gigalitres of water that we hold right

now for environmental purposes and 1500 when you take what we've  contracted as well.

Every year there's more water specifically reserved for the environment  as we track through this time. So it means wetlands that previously  were living as though they were in drought, years before the drought  actually arrived will now get a level of resilience back into them.

BARRY CASSIDY:    So what are the responsibilities of the states now? What must they do?

TONY BURKE:        The states have an opportunity to put forward projects, which - they say  they will so I presume they will - which will occur in place of buyback...

BARRY CASSIDY:    These are infrastructure projects?

TONY BURKE:        That's right. That's right. A good example is the Menindee Lakes Project  where by reengineering the way Menindee Lakes work out there near  Broken Hill that you get more water that is automatically back there in  the river. So it doesn't need to be held by the Commonwealth  Environmental Water Holder but environmentally the water's back in the  river.

Those sorts of projects are ways that we deliver the environmental  outcome in methods other than held water. So the states have that.  The other thing is over the next few years they have to develop their  water plans and submit those. We work on the basis that even if states  - no one's going to look at the plan and say that's exactly the way they  would have written it. I do believe they've all got a plan that they can  effectively work with.

BARRY CASSIDY:    So they put forward these infrastructure projects and you pay for them?

TONY BURKE:        That's right. To the extent that the infrastructure projects bridge the  gap, the money that would have been spent on buyback is available to  fund those projects. If the projects cost more than that then the states  have to fork out the extra. But from the way projects have been worked  up so far, we're working on the basis that the buyback money will  actually substantially pay for the projects they put forward.

BARRY CASSIDY:    But it doesn't sound as if that's the way NSW sees it for example.  They're still talking about the risk of communities being devastated by  buybacks and they want limits on the buybacks.

TONY BURKE:        The limits they talk about - if New South Wales puts forward the projects  that they claim they're going to put forward, then those limits on  buyback automatically occur. The only risk to the buyback numbers that  they're talking about - the only risk of it being above that - is if they  choose to not put forward the projects. So unless they've got some plan  they haven't told us about, about avoiding these projects being put  forward, I'm not sure what the argument's actually about.

BARRY CASSIDY:    But when he says - Barry O'Farrell as he did just then - that he wants a  cap of three per cent and if you don't agree New South Wales will go it  alone and legislate that way. Can they do that and what would be the  significance of that?

TONY BURKE:        Well, there's some principles under water trading agreed since the  National Water Initiative - some of them come into play in a more  formalised way on 1 July 2014 where New South Wales would have to  look long and hard as to whether or not they're breaching those. I just  can't understand why they'd even want to run that argument, given  that if they put forward the projects they've said they're putting  forward, the problem doesn't arise.

BARRY CASSIDY:    Nevertheless, when you have three states - Victoria, South Australia and  New South Wales - none of them are confident about it working or they  seem to have reservations about it. It doesn't augur well, does it, for  the intergovernmental agreement?

TONY BURKE:        If we worked on the basis that the only way to get an agreement was  for every state to be completely happy then we'd wait another century  before we managed the Murray-Darling as a national system. This is  one where it's always been easy for people to say it's not exactly what I  want, I'll blow it all up, I'll walk away and every year it's just got worse.

What changed and what changed ever since the Keating Government  was in place and you had that blue green algae outbreak, was it  stopped just being a negotiation between states and the rivers started  to negotiate back. The rivers negotiated harder than any of the states  because they effectively said if you run the system into the ground then  none of you can use the water. That's what those outbreaks meant.

BARRY CASSIDY:    What about the Tasmanian Forestry Agreement? Now, just a few weeks  ago it seemed that a resolution - well, it would take an eternity to  achieve. What happened in the meantime?

TONY BURKE:        Well, we don't have all the elements of an agreement yet. There's some  votes still happening within organisations this weekend in Tasmania and  then there's decisions to still go through the Tasmanian Parliament. But  effectively what's happened there, the timber industry around the  nation is going through a structural change - a very significant one  that's quite different to the boom and bust cycle that the industry's  always been through.

Tasmania has been particularly reliant on the timber industry and so the  adjustment for them has been massive. When Gunns exited native  forestry there is an opportunity for industry to be able to get help in  adjusting to the new market conditions and for there to be conservation  outcomes that previously had never been thought possible. So all the  groups had self-interest to getting to an agreement. A couple of weeks  ago it looked like they weren't going to get there.

We're now on the cusp of everybody giving a little bit more ground than

they thought they would ever and getting conservation outcomes that  have always seemed impossible, but at the same time, getting industry  on a really solid footing with things like what they call FSC certification  which is becoming increasingly demanded in world markets but without  an agreement realistically was always going to be - they were going to  fall short on.

BARRY CASSIDY:    It just still seem fanciful that we'll no longer see these protests in the  forest in Tasmania as we've seen now for decades - that the loggers  can go in and do their work undisturbed. It's not a picture that readily  spreads - springs to mind. Do you really think that you can get to that  stage?

TONY BURKE:        One of the things they talk about a durability provision. One of the  things the conservation groups were holding out for a long time on  whether they'd agree to but was part of what's emerged this week,  which is that some of the big conservation outcomes are held back.  Unless they keep to their word, those additional - it's about 100,000  hectares - those additional areas actually don't become part of the  conservation estate unless the groups are good to their word.

So I don't think you'll ever get a bigger incentive for conservation  groups than to know if you wreck the industry then some of the areas  don't get saved. Those sorts of compromises that people have made  have shown a level of goodwill that is not exactly what we've come to  expect in Tasmania. But if they're willing to step up to the mark, then  as we work through this I think governments have a real incentive to  try to make it work.

BARRY CASSIDY:    On the question of compromises - and I want to ask you about the  asylum seekers policy because there's now this prospect of asylum  seekers going into communities but they're forbidden to work. Tony  Abbott has come up with idea of working for welfare. Now, Doug  Cameron talks about the risk of an underclass being developed. What's  wrong with that idea of letting them engage with the community and  work for their money?

TONY BURKE:        The challenge has been, as I understand, that in some parts of the  world the people smugglers have been very directly selling the fact that  even if you don't get accepted you'll get to work for a few years in  Australia. That of itself has been a reason that people smugglers have  been able to increase the number of people putting their lives at risk on  the high seas. Yet that story that's been spoken about earlier in the  program, that's exactly why we're here in this policy area.

People are drowning at sea. We need to make sure that we can do  everything within our power to stop that. If one of the marketing tools  that's being used is the fact that you can get a job in Australia, then yes  it is tough. It's very harsh. But I don't want to see a situation where we  do anything that adds to the risk of people losing their lives.

BARRY CASSIDY:    All right. The final week of the parliament is coming up and the  Opposition has already flagged what it plans to make the big issue and  that is the AWU scandal. The Bruce Wilson contribution, what do you  make of that?

TONY BURKE:        Well, you'd appreciate over the last fortnight I've been preoccupied with  some policy areas and haven't followed every minutiae of this. But from  what I've looked at in today's papers, it's story over. It really is. From  what I've seen in today's papers the big allegation of connection that  the Opposition haven't been quite willing to make because they've  never actually put forward a specific allegation, it appears the door has  slammed pretty firmly shut on that. If you look at over this last year...

BARRY CASSIDY:    But there are other people contributing to this debate, not just Bruce  Wilson.

TONY BURKE:        Yes - but over the last year they have thrown everything at the Prime  Minister. The smears, the slander, the negativity - she's still there.  We're doing the job. We're getting through the policy work. Tony  Abbott's been saying he's going to start having, you know, less  negativity, a bit more policy. Well, this week he can either keep beating  up a story which appears that the door's just shut on it firmly today or  have a go at some policy.

BARRY CASSIDY:    Well, there's somebody who doesn't think the door's shut on it. Peter  Hartcher wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald that this is the greatest  crisis this Government has faced. It represents a grave and immediate  danger to Labor's hold on power.

TONY BURKE:        He's wrong. I preferred some other parts of that article. But on that part  of it, it's wrong.

BARRY CASSIDY:    But what is the feeling in Caucus? Is it that the Prime Minister should be  - step up to the plate a little more and just take head-on some of these  questions?

TONY BURKE:        Take on what allegation? The Prime Minister has stood up in media  conferences where the journalist who's been the prime person writing  these stories has been there at the media conference and the PM said  do you have any allegations to make. The answer is no. So when all of  that's the case, I don't think it's a bad thing for a government to be  getting on with policy work - to be getting on whether it's the economy,  whether it's disability, whether it's education, whether it's the work I've  been doing. From time to time, it'd be good if the Opposition could have  a go at actually engaging with it.

BARRY CASSIDY:    Well, there's one question. Bill Shorten, a colleague - a minister -  remarked that the - the account that Julia Gillard helped set up was  unauthorised and inappropriate. Was it unauthorised and inappropriate  and, if it was, why did she help set it up?

TONY BURKE:        Well, there's an issue there for how things were working within the  union at the time. I'm not going to pretend to be across the minutiae of  that. But every attempt there's been to connect indirectly - law firms  are involved when they're asked to set up an account in setting up an  account - you know - the way people have tried to spin it as though  there's something particular there about the Prime Minister, every time  they follow it through it comes up with nothing. I just wish we'd get on  with issues that actually affect the rest of Australia.

BARRY CASSIDY:    It is that query though over unauthorised and I guess you say are there  questions for the Prime Minister? One question is what steps should she  take to familiarise herself with this, given that the union apparently  didn't know about it?

TONY BURKE:        Barry, in fairness, I don't say are there questions, I say are there  allegations - because if there are no allegations - there are plenty of  questions in every other area of policy that affect the nation. That's  what we're there to do. That's what the Government is doing. If the  Opposition wants to engage down this other path, it's for media and  others to make up a decision as to what's more important. Now, this  network gave good coverage of some major policy decisions I was  involved with this week for example.

You're really pushing it in a number of other places to see those issues  that have been plaguing the country for a century to actually get a bit  of coverage. We, as a government - we are in control of whether we're

doing the work, whether we're making the policy decisions, whether  we're delivering the big reforms. It's not our decision whether or not  other issues which have no allegations attached to them end up going  higher and higher in the news cycle. But I've got to say, I think  Australians are a bit sick of the news not being about them.

BARRY CASSIDY:    Thanks for your time this morning.
