THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



STATEMENT



Labor is concerned by reports in the media about the punitive treatment of a male  refugee currently on Nauru.

According to the report, the man was convicted and fined following a suicide attempt.

Australia has an obligation in respect of the safety of all refugees and asylum  seekers in its direct and indirect care, both in Australia and offshore.

Labor calls on Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to investigate this matter urgently.  Labor does not believe it is acceptable for a person to be charged in such a  circumstance.

The need to resolve the fate of asylum seekers on Nauru is critical - the Australian  Government must find a durable, third country resettlement arrangement.
